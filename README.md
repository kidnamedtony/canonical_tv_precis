### Introduction:

Canocial TV Precis is a student project that, as its (subject to change) name implies, aims to give users the best and most representative experience of a television series given a user-defined number of episodes.

Although more plentiful and accessible than ever, the options for what one can watch are overwhelming, making the time-investment stakes incredibly high for the potential viewer.  Be that as it may, it's arguable that in this age of "Peak TV," television watching has never been more essential, socially and culturally. To ignore television is, essentially, to opt out from being able to share in the daily social interactions that revolve around discussing them (see: Game of Thrones, the Office, Mad Men, etc.)

This project aims to weigh IMDB ratings data versus episode synopses data to determine the best, and most diverse viewing list based on the amount of episodes that the user determines they have the time or patience for. The goal is to provide the best "feel," both in quality and theme, that a particular show has to offer, without sacrificing all of one's time and attention to it.
