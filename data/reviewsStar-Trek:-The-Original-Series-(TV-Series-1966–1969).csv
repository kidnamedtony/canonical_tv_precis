0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spock's Brain (TV Episode 1968)",Forget the smug derision this episode gets. It's Trek at it's goofy best.,"Trek at it's best is sublime, at it's worst embarrassing to watch, but why is this episode so panned? It is great fun. Admittedly one is left feeling one has watched some sort of pantomime special, or a Trek equivalent of Police Squad. However, there are far worse episodes in series three - The Way to Eden is at the bottom of the barrel in my opinion - and I'm personally grateful that the studio pulled the plug as the scriptwriters were rapidly running out of new ideas.The plot is simple. A matriarchal underground society steals Spock's brain because their old one - which controls all their underground machinery - has broke. See? Perfectly understandable. Kirk, Scotty and McCoy beam down to rescue him/it, in the process discovering there's a bit more to this act of theft than first appears.Would it be a spoiler to reveal that Spock is reunited with his brain ready for the next episode? DeForest Kelley is a delight to watch as the stressed brain surgeon, and his banter with Nemoy immediately after is equally entertaining.Forget the smug derision this episode gets. It's Trek at it's goofy best, up there with The Trouble with Tribbles and various other ""don't worry too much about the plot"" episodes.",8
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spock's Brain (TV Episode 1968)",An ominous preview of season 3,"I was reading Leonard Nimoy's wonderful 1995 book ""I am Spock"" where he described this show as an embarrassment to the original Star Trek TOS series and ""an ominous portent"" of things to come in season three. (p.114) I'm afraid I have to agree with Nimoy: the script is so full of holes that one could drive a car through it. Basically, a beautiful young woman appears mysteriously on the Enterprise and steals Spock's brain. Then the Enterprise crew track this intruder down to a planet called Sigma Draconis VI which is going through an ice age where primitive cavemen subsist on the surface whereas a sophisticated civilization of women--that have Spock's Brain--live underground. Once the Star Trek crew beam down and overpowers the female leader of this 'civilization' called the Eymorgs, they operate to restore Spock brain to his body. Soon, you have Spock's brain coming alive and actually instructing Dr. McCoy on the means to attach his brain to his head mid-way through the operation. Frankly, the script for this episode is 'brainless' and atrocious. Nimoy notes that one of the major defects in this show included the basic question of how these women could survive without going extinct since they were completely segregated from the more primitive male population on the planet's surface. (pp.115-16) Moreover, the part where Kara, the Eymorg's leader, infamously says to the Enterprise crew when questioned about Spoc's Brain: ""Brain and brain, what is brain?"" is not credible even with the excuse that her 'creator' empowered her superhuman knowledge that lasts for only 3 hours. To put it succinctly, the plot is simply abysmal. It would have been preferable if the producers had chosen to screen 'Spectre of the Gun' at the start of season 3--which was actually the first episode produced--rather than Spock's Brain which was only the sixth show made this season. As Nimoy aptly writes, ""frankly during the entire shooting of that episode, I was embarrassed--a feeling that overcame me many times during the final season."" (pp.115) He was right: there were many more turkeys to come in the form of 'And the Children shall lead,' 'The Way to Eden', 'The Lights of Zetar,' or 'The Cloudminders' where Spock tells a woman he barely met about Vulcan's mating habits--a subject which he was too aghast to reveal to captain Kirk in ""Amok Time."" Frankly, many of the scripts of season 3 are highly uneven or poorly conceived: for every 1 good episode, you got 2 to 3 clunkers. The reason for this decline was that most of the experienced crew--Roddenberry, DC Fontana, Gene Coon--who made Star Trek such a success in seasons 1 and 2--had quit prior to season 3 leaving the show in the hands of new movie makers who didn't know what made Star Trek special. Moreover, NBC slashed the show's budget in its final season. This led to more and more Star Trek episodes becoming progressively less believable or just plain awful. This episode displays the end result. Frankly, its amazing that several good to excellent Trek episodes such as 'Day of the Dove', 'The Enterprise Incident', 'The Tholian Web', 'All Our Yesterdays', 'Requiem for Methuselah' or 'Elaan of Troyius' were actually made this season. This reflects highly of the professionalism of the Star Trek actors and their beleaguered season 3 executive producer, Fred Freiberger.",2
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spock's Brain (TV Episode 1968)",brainless but fun,"This is one of my favorite episodes simply because it's one of the goofiest. Spock's brain is stolen, and the crew go in search of the brain. What makes the episode so amusing is McCoy using a remote control to drive Spock's body -- sit, stand, go forward, turn.No, this episode did not push the boundaries of science fiction. It did not feature amazing acting talents, riveting dialogue, nor astonishing plot twists. But it was damn funny, and not because it was trying to be.And the ""teaching"" helmet is a gas too. Kudos to the props department.Don't skip this one!",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spock's Brain (TV Episode 1968)",Brain and Brain! What is Brain?,"Here I am, at the start of a new year, watching ""Spock's Brain"" again. There goes one resolution down the drain. It's unfortunate that this episode may have been the introduction for many viewers to the Trek series (it was the 1st broadcast of the 3rd season). What a difference a new season makes! Like ""The Trouble With Tribbles,"" this is one of the most famous episodes, but for different reasons, having to do with the epitome of lousiness. Knowledge of Trek's cheese factor may have spread from this point. There's really nothing wrong with the plot, on paper - an early version of ""Star Trek III:The Search For Spock"" of '84; in this case, it's 'The Search For Spock's Brain.' Here, Kirk and crew are moving along in their starship, minding their own business, when a small ion-propelled ship approaches; a space babe materializes on the bridge of the Enterprise and knocks out everyone with the touch of a button on her spiffy bracelet (and I mean, EVERYone, on the entire ship! - similar to ""By Any Other Name""). When the crew awaken, they find something missing - you guessed it! - Spock's brain! Yes, this is Spock's final episode - just kidding. Here's a minor discrepancy already: the female invader is able to conk out everyone immediately; yet later, on the planet they find her on, she and her cohorts take the trouble to affix funky belts on Kirk and his boys to send painful knockout signals. I won't even elaborate on the slow pace of this episode, with the camera, for example, settling on an immobile Spock standing there, as if something is about to happen, yet nothing does.Someone, meaning the producers, the director and the actors, took a wrong turn or at least a sideways view of this story. As an example, when McCoy slowly informs Kirk of Spock's, eh, problem, it was probably meant to be a suspenseful, grim scene. It isn't. 'His brain is gone..!' McCoy says, looking a bit shell-shocked. Kirk mouths the same phrase, also shocked or stunned. You expect Scotty to repeat it yet again, then Nurse Chapel. I think you get the tone of most of the episode - you're chuckling by this point. By the time we get to the underground civilization on that planet, things have escalated to a laugh-riot, with 'Morgs' and 'Eymorgs' and 'you are not Morg' ringing in our ears as Kirk tries to make sense of a wacko culture divided between female rulers and male brutes. Spock's body is turned into a walking puppet, guided by McCoy's gizmo like a toy robot. Kirk's key meeting with the ruling females, all of whom speak like spoiled teenagers, becomes an exercise in ultimate Trek cheese; Kirk even gets on his knees to grovel at one point, before the female ruler sends him spasming into painful oblivion. It's rather ghastly yet you can't turn away, spellbound in disbelief by the hysterics on screen. All the concepts are sabotaged by the execution, even the climactic brain re-attachment surgery, which begins fine; McCoy gets his brain boosted and proceeds with new skills. Then he starts to forget and Spock talks him through the rest, the audience understanding full well that neither has the knowledge of these unknown techniques. Some entertainment value is there, no doubt, but beware; this all could be a... dare I say it - a drain on the brain.",4
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spock's Brain (TV Episode 1968)",The audience must have lost its brain to buy into this premise,"The other reviewers are right. This episode ranks up there with the space hippies one as the worst of the whole Star Trek series. Aliens steal Spock's brain and he survives without it! Riiight. Not only does he survive, Mccoy can control him like a wind-up toy with a little remote control. It gets worse - much worse. The aliens who performed this miraculous non-lethal brain surgery are attractive young females (of course!) that have a three year old's intelligence and can't string together a full sentence. Despite the females' dumbness, they manage to keep Kirk and crew at bay through most of the episode. The scene where McCoy reconnects Spock's brain one step at a time and Spock gains functionality one limb at a time was just painful to watch. The brain does not work that way. And the second the brain surgery is done, Spock gets up and walks around as if he just got a message. I've been through serious surgery. You can't just get up and walk around the second the surgeon says done.",1
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spock's Brain (TV Episode 1968)","""Brain, brain, brain! What is brain?!""","There are some redeeming features to this *ahem* ""legendary"" episode of Trekdom. In spite of the poor script the new creative team tried to spruce up the cinematic and thematic flavor of a series that was on the wane.Notably shots that the devout viewer never saw in the first two seasons are introduced. Note the shot from behind the captain's chair looking forward to the main viewer as Kirk and crew try to track Spock's gray matter. In addition we're given a dash of routine starship operations that we were denied in previous episodes; notably looking at a solar system and narrowing down the possible worlds of where to search.It's a unique, and in this way almost ""refreshing"" (I use that word guardedly) approach to Star Trek. The creative forces were trying to salvage what they could due to budget cuts. Even the story is tweaked and finagled to try to gear up for a lack of funds. Note the cavemen and their appearance in the episode, and their relation to the surface on the world.The episode itself deals with a sexual riff between men and women from a society that tried to protect its most valuable asset; women and children from a disaster, thereby creating a divided social norm where the natives are delegated to their pre-societal norms. Their only salvation is a neural library that can temporary deposit valuable knowledge.To cap off the sexual theme women are given pain delivering devices that keep the captive men enslaved to their whims. We're witnessing the primal states of the sexes, and a bare bones association of their relations to one another on a world that's all but forgotten the trappings of what once was.The story tries to bridge and reconstruct the gap between men and women on this world, but fails miserably, even though it does wrap up the basic story by restoring Star Fleet's most valuable first officer. The implication at the end is that the world is restored to normalcy, but nonesuch is really apparent.Yes, it's a travesty of science fiction television, but it's got some very minor redeeming traits that should raise an eyebrow or two for the astute viewer. On the other hand, in spite of this, it is pretty hokey. Certainly not one of the more sterling installments of Kirk-n-Spock Trek, but interesting on an academic level.Take it for what it's worth.",
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spock's Brain (TV Episode 1968)","""He was worse than dead""!","While watching I was reminded of the 1962 flick ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"" with a no name cast and a female character who's head was dismembered in a freak auto accident. The head was kept alive by the woman's doctor boyfriend with the idea that he would find a suitably sexy replacement body. Nominally a horror film, this picture wound up being inadvertently comic in it's absurdity, with it's protagonist tagged with the nickname Jan in the Pan by it's cult followers.Now as long as Spock was going to be commandeered for his scientific super brain, why not go whole hog and just decapitate him altogether? Could it possibly have been any worse than what was developed here? I really couldn't believe it when Captain Kirk, faced with the dire consequences of the situation, managed to proclaim to Bones that they had to go ""...in search of his brain, Doctor"".I should have suspected something strange was going to happen as soon as the opening credits rolled and the series changed the color of it's graphics to that clashing blue hue. I kept thinking about that up until about the time alien Kara (Marj Dusay) first appeared in those purple go-go boots. I might be cynical here, but is that what thirtieth century best dressed aliens might be wearing? So let's not kid ourselves and think there might be a rational explanation for this episode. Roddenberry and crew went for the gusto with this one, producing a Frankenstein version of Spock and keeping us on the edge of our seats to figure out how this would all work out. Even there I had to chuckle. Spock's noggin was suitably barred from view for McCoy's operation, and then when it was over, Spock emerged with a full head of hair! This one wins the camp award for the entire series, fully living up to it's tag line of providing pain and delight, all at the same time.",6
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spock's Brain (TV Episode 1968)",A sexy alien steals Spock's brain,"As this episode opens the Enterprise encounters a highly advanced spacecraft; as they approach a beautiful woman beams aboard and uses a device wish causes the entire crew to collapse. When they regain consciousness Kirk receives a call from McCoy telling him to go to sickbay; here he finds Spock minus his brain! His Vulcan physiology means his body can last twenty four hours before it dies. The Enterprise follows the alien vessel's ion trail to a star system with three Class-M planets; not appear to support advanced life but some signals from one, a world in an ice age, suggest it is worth investigating. The landing party discover primitive men on the surface who have no idea what women are; the do however talk of 'The Others' who 'bring pain and pleasure'. It turns out these 'Others' are women who live in an underground complex; they don't appear advanced enough to have taken Spock's brain yet it turns out his brain is indeed there; being used as the 'Controller'; regulating the operation of the complex. Kirk demands its return but the women aren't keen to return it. Captured and fitted with 'pain belts' the away team will have to hurry if they are to return Spock's brain to his body!This, the opening episode of the third and final season, is silly but rather fun. The idea that a sexy alien will turn up and steal Spock's brain is hilarious. We are of course used to William Shatner's delightfully hammy performance as Kirk but here he turns it up to eleven. Even DeForest Kelley gets in on the act as McCoy when he uses an alien device to gain the skills required to put Spock's brain back in then loss the knowledge half way through. The idea of a world where the genders live separately is interesting although the way it works here doesn't work too well as each gender doesn't seem to understand the purpose for the other. The way Spock's body is moved by remote control is so corny it is hilarious. Overall this isn't a bad episode but it is far from a classic.",7
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spock's Brain (TV Episode 1968)","Great McCoy Moment, Ala' Forbiden Planet Fame","Considered the ""worse"" of Trek TOS fame by many, it's not the best, but FAR from the worse. Keep in mind that what some hate others may really like, so my all time low episodes probably reveal who I am, a man, that hates (well not really ""hate"" but are not my favorites) the seriously touchie feelie episodes that probably appeal to women. Also, I like episodes that have classic scenes between the trio of Kirk, Spock, McCoy with the added Scottie as well (or good nemesis). One thing I try to tell younger viewers (I'm in my 40's and watched Trek in reruns in the 70's and 80's) is that compared to later Trek series, you had to love the way the women were dressed in TOS, at least I do! Thats the 60's man, and even though it was the ""free love"" generation, not many shows had a consistent array of sexy women dressed in some seriously sexy outfits as Trek TOS does! So what have we here and why do I NOT consider it the ""worse"" episode ever made? There's a cool new starship (a somewhat ""rarity in previous seasons, there are a few new ships in season three), the nemesis's here are hot women in sexy outfits (gotta love that with TOS!), and McCoy has a GREAT scene trying to re-implant Spocks brain! That McCoy scene was a copy of the Krell's brain machine in Forbidden Planet, nice tribute (or ripoff), it works nicely. If your into S&M this may have added attraction as the women who live underground do interact with the male topsiders when they are in the mood, with one condition; the males need to wear a pain inducing discipline belt! Gotta love it, and McCoy's great scene. 6 of 10. Its far from MY worse rated episode.",6
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spock's Brain (TV Episode 1968)",How could they miss that chance?,"I watched this episode in agony. Other reviews already explained extensively why it's so bad. And when I say bad, I mean worse than usual cheesy bad Star Trek which we all enjoy.As the idiot Eymorg lady was getting life lessons from Kirk on merits of struggling to survive and evolve naturally; Teacher's steroid effect fades from McCoy. He cannot take another shot of lethargy overloading brain boost from the device, and that's OK for the sake of tension. The solution should've been Eymorg leader taking initiative and boosting herself to complete the procedure. That would mean so much: that lazy civilization learning their lesson, showing compassion and selflessness, which would also prevent Kirk's guiding speech hanging in the air.Instead, they just made up another ridiculous aspect of Vulcan ability to semi-connect to their brain and still guide a master surgeon in the right direction. That way this foolish scene also leaves out if the message is understood by the Eymorg, because she missed the perfect chance.As if the episode isn't dead already, the masculine frat buddy bridge crew ridicules Spock's ""fascination"", analysis and resolution of what he had experienced. Oh, man... These guys' mentalities are closer to the surface caveman than to Spock or any other so called advanced civilization.I'd give it a 4, but this final blow explained above barely makes it fit for a 2.",2
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spock's Brain (TV Episode 1968)",All the men on the planet are imprisoned by 'pain belts' as a means to keep them under control,"An alien, Kara (Marj Dusay), beams aboard the Enterprise, knocks the crew out, and steals Spocks brain! The search is on for Spock, the search for his brain anyway, as McCoy keeps his body alive with electronics.Locating the aliens planet the crew beam down to investigate. The crew are quickly captured, and imprisoned by 'pain-belts'. All the men on the planet are imprisoned by 'pain-belts'. Women, who rule this society, need these belts to keep men in line. Why didn't they think to bring along Uhuru...His brain's alive. They find and communicate with Spock - realizing his brain's been taken by these aliens in order that it can run their society. For example, Spock senses he's breathing, but he's only activating environmental controls. These women aren't very technologically advanced themselves. They're only using technology left over from olden times and the crew manage to escape and free Spock. McCoy uses their advanced technology to set things right, and this society is returned to it's 'normal' course.This episode is known for being 'bad', however, this episode has many great Star Trek themes: showing disembodied consciousness, technology that can vastly speed up learning, and primitives who have access to advanced technology (either technology from their own past or alien technology {in one Trek episode, Errand of Mercy, they come across the 'Organians' who appear to be very primitive, only to find out at the end, they are extremely advanced. Their leader saying, ""While it's true, in time, you and the Klingons will become fast-friends..."". Spock observes, ""I should think the Organians are as far above us on the evolutionary scale, as we are above the Amoeba""}). Of course, the pain-belts, being needed to control the men is unique to this episode...'Spocks Brain' is known as being the worst Star Trek episode, it's like the kid in class everyone picks on. Like the kid in class everyone picks on, is this one really that much different from the others? It's no big deal to poke fun at this episode. I suppose it's fun. Even the biggest fans sometimes enjoy making fun of this or that about Star Trek. Is it a good thing to make fun of oneself? Sometimes I wonder whether it is or not...Perhaps tho, the criticism of this episode reveals more about the critic than it reveals about the episode. Perhaps, in the way bullying takes place in the story 'The Mysterious Stranger' by Mark Twain; kids pick on other kids, because ultimately they are afraid of being picked on themselves.Lets laugh at ourselves and not be afraid of being made fun of? Or, lets protect ourselves and others, and show real human sympathy towards someone who is being made fun of? We all love to laugh. Why is it no one ever cries?",7

All these episodes are far worse and dumber than even this one is! (Yes, there are several more.) Most bad Trek episodes suffer from bad stories and bad props. (""Spock's Brain"" suffers from really bad props and sound effects.) Plot: Spock's brain is hijacked and used to run an advanced civilization with no intelligent survivors. The women live far below the surface and are incredibly ""hot"" but addle-brained, wearing thigh-high ""catsuits"" (purrrr). No ""fatties"" survive in outer space! The surface-dwelling men are tall, oafish, hunky Viking-types wearing L.L. Bean fur-lined shorts. The ""horn"" sound effect is annoying and hard to take seriously. It's used on countless episodes. Obviously recycled props are everywhere: the computer lights (they keep on blinking and blinking...""Airplane 2!""). Spock's brain receptacle is a white glass globe from Ace Hardware. The hallways look exactly like the Enterprise with triangular doors and new spray paint. They borrowed the ""Teaching Helmet"" concept from Disney's ""Merlin Jones"" and MGM's ""Forbidden Planet"". Spock is wearing a Radio Shack transformer-like helmet and Bones has a big TV remote control to guide him around. The theme, of clueless backward people running things which an advanced civilization left behind, was a re-occurring storyline on Star Trek. (Bill Shatner may be right after all... This is a bad episode!)",7

There's science, cute chicks, and great comedy.A hot babe infiltrates Spock's noggin and appropriates his gray matter. The crew goes after it. The pretty girls don't really know what the hell's going on anymore than Kirk and company do. Eventually, they find Spock's disembodied part and try to put it back where it belongs. It's so funny watching Spock's 'brainless' body being 'mechanically directed' to walk. We all know it's Leonard Nimoy pretending not to have a brain.Good fun. Even the title is funny.....

The bad ones around 6.5--so the 5.2 in strongly indicative of how dumb this one is.A mysterious woman magically arrives on the ship.

Then, when they awaken, McCoy informs the Captain that this occurred--at which point, Kirk asks if Spock will be okay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DUH!!!!!!!! I couldn't help but laugh the first time I heard this! What was Kirk thinking?! Maybe find him a chimp brain or something? So, right here you can tell this is a mondo-brainless episode. It gets even worse when they use a cool box on dead Spock's body to reanimate him! It seems, according to McCoy, that although Spock has no brain, he's actually fine this way until they can somehow find the brain and shove it back again!!!!!!!!!!!! Really, I don't need to go on. Just thinking about the episode nearly makes me laugh because the plot is THAT bad. This is sort of like the PLAN 9 version of Star Trek--monumental in its badness. So bad that it's great to watch with friends so you can make fun of it. So bad that THE WONDER YEARS did a funny parody about it.",2

15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spock's Brain (TV Episode 1968)",Don't judge the series by this one poor episode.,"As a fan of the series I have always felt a since of pleasure when viewing episodes of the original Star Trek series. However, this one episode goes beyond-the-pale of logic to create a show that is unworthy of such an enjoyable program. Let us just hope that people will not judge the entire series collection by this one poor offering.It actually starts off rather interesting when some chick materializes on the bridge of the Enterprise and begins pushing some buttons on her wrist-band that looks like something Isis would wear. After each push of her wrist buttons, the entire crew of the Enterprise on all decks would become unconscious. Upon awakening from their state, the crew found that someone had stolen Spock's brain. And for some silly reason Spock is still alive but is absolutely brainless (no pun intended).Anyway Captain Kirk is determined to find Spock's brain and replace it back into Spock's head. And since McCoy advises that Spock can only live a few hours without a brain, he rigs Spock's body with some kind of mechanism that will allow the body to be controlled by a box that can have Spock's body do some incredible stunts. So they take the body down to the planet to find the chick that stole the brain.If you believe the first part of the show was silly just wait till you view the second half. You find Spock's brain protected by the chick that was on the Enterprise and her sisters, you have Kirk able to communicate orally with Spock's brain, you have Spock's brainless body able to wrestle one of the girls for control of an object and then McCoy get a helmet of knowledge. All way too daffy for even a fan of the series to comprehend.Do not judge the series by this one episode. This episode was hard to watch for even the most avid fan of the Star Trek name. I'm just glad that there are very few poor episodes. This just happens to be the worse of the worse.",3

The cave men are stupid and they all have exactly the same hair and beards. Then we find out there's a whole city of hot chicks who live underground. There are a lot of classic puzzled looks from the actors in this episode. And it's brilliantly contrasted with shots of the stone faced brainless Spock. And finally we get to see McCoy wig out with some awesome under the chin camera work.The new 3D Enterprise looks killer. They took the classic Enterprise and were able to get some great camera movements with cgi. And the details on the ship are wicked. First class job all the way.And for me, almost nothing is funnier than the mechanical Spock seizing the pain giving device from the space chick.",10

The actors perform with charm and enthusiasm, the story is engaging despite the low budget sets and props, and we also catch a glimpse of Mccoy's compassionate feelings for Spock, which is something we don't often see. This particular episode has a good balance of cheap gags, classic hammy acting from shatner (which we can't get enough of) and suspense. The only flaw with this episode is that the back story to the scenario could have been elaborated on a little more. The situation the crew find themselves in seems rather vague at times but this doesn't ruin the show. If you love Original Series, don't skip on this one.",8

Where does that leave Spock? Think for a moment what it would be like to have your brain stolen! I mean, what could you do? You couldn't do the simplest things...eat, drink, or talk; and many other things, would be impossible without your brain. Hopefully, if it ever happens to any of us, our friends who genuinely love us would do their utmost to find our brain and restore it, like what happens here.

The episode becomes more cheesy as it's located on a plant of attractive women who use a special machine for the brain surgery. Cheesy story, with campy acting and script. Comic, the women is totally clueless and refuses to re-attached Spock's brain. Spock become the brain centre or C P U for a huge system which runs the plant. McCoy must do the surgery with this cone of knowledge machine. McCoy takes a risk with the machine, and forgets the surgery halfway threw. Spock talks McCoy threw the surgery. The director and writer had fun with this one. Campy, cheesy, and just plain fun. Not the best script and or acting, but memorable. 6 out of 10!",6

A female appears on the bridge and uses a device to knock them all out, when they awake Spock is not moving. McCoy takes Spock to sickbay, examines him only to find Spock's brain missing - surgically removed - all nerve endings are repaired -- Spock's Vulcan body is fine just his brain is missing. Kirk and crew follows the ion trail to the 6th planet in that solar system. Kirk takes a gamble and beams down with Chekov, Scotty and a couple of red shirts to inspect the icy planet. They run across a primitive group of humans - they refer to the others as bringers of pain. Kirk then has McCoy to beam down to check some remains and when he does, he brings Spock's remote controlled body along. Kirk okays Spock's body with them and they do some investigating to find a large underground facility. Kirk uses his communicator and picks up Spock's brainwave thoughts, Spock responds to Kirk and search crew. As they move along to find Spock's brain they are captured by the aliens. The aliens seem to know nothing when they speak to Kirk and crew... but eventually get information about a controller. It seems Spock's brain is the controller and Kirk and crew want to speak to the Controller.

22,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spock's Brain (TV Episode 1968)",I always loved this episode,"I'm not sure why some people have such a problem with this episode. Using a brain to control a society has been used several times on Star trek, and it seems quite logical. Yep, I said logical.
The premise of the show allows for technology to control Spocks's body. Muscles are controlled using electricity, so there is no reason a future brainless body can't be controlled remotely. As a little boy I thought it was sooo cool. As an older man I still think it's cool. They are working on similar technology to aid people with paralysis right now.
We can also transplant some organs today. I have to assume someday that a brain transplant could be possible. Especially if an advanced alien machine teaches us how. Remember, this is science fiction, not science fact. I thought this was an interesting idea, and it was well executed. It was a head of it's time (pun intended).
Far better then watching episodes where the next generation taxi diplomats around known space. Or episodes where Voyage has yet another shuttle accident, or only has 20% shields left.
The creativity of the original series episodes, like this one, has never been duplicated. Copied, yes. The Enterprise episode Dead Stop, has many humanoid brains controlling a automated repair station. This episode was very well received, and has essentially the same premise. The only major difference, as far as the brain stuff goes, is we get to see a remote controlled man, and an amusing operation. That's just awesome.",9
23,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spock's Brain (TV Episode 1968)",Idiotic Example of the Series' Worst Excesses,"One of the worst episodes of the series, with poor dialogue and acting, and a remarkably stupid premise.A mysterious visitor appears on the bridge of the Enterprise, renders the crew unconscious, and removes Spock's brain to run their civilization. Naturally, Kirk, Scott, McCoy, and (an automaton-like) Spock go below the planet surface to retrieve the brain. Unfortunately, the dialogue consists of such memorable lines as ""Brain and brain, what is brain"" and Shatner's hammy tendencies make themselves readily apparent as they would throughout most of the third season).

Unfortunately, Spock has his stolen by some strange woman who gets on board the Enterprise. So begins a journey, meeting a series of stupid people who, even though they still have their brains, are of no help. Spock's brain is used to provide the control center to keep a civilization where Neanderthal men are in one place and Neanderthal women are in the other. Apparently, William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy were utterly embarrassed by this episode (in many of the third season episodes, for that matter). The sight of Spock walking around with this idiotic look on his face (the fact that Vulcans can still function without a brain is asinine as well) is one of the most insulting things that's ever been on television.",4
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Enterprise Incident (TV Episode 1968)",The Mission of the Enterprise is Impossible,"The ""Mission:Impossible""-style entry of the original series, dealing with espionage and subterfuge and con games of galactic proportions. This is the return of the Romulans (""The Deadly Years"" doesn't really count) after their smashing debut in ""Balance of Terror."" It's small wonder that this race is a favorite among Trek fans; both their original episodes are particularly strong. At the start of the episode, we learn, via an echoing voice-over from McCoy, that Kirk has been behaving oddly, as if the stress of command had taken its toll. Indeed, when I first saw this as a kid, I thought, by the end of the first act, that - yep, Kirk's lost it; he's really sailed over the edge in this one; all those conflicts with Klingons, Kelvans, crazy computers, space amoebas, cloud creatures, disembodied brains, doomsday machines and Tribbles have finally produced some post-traumatic stress syndrome in the poor captain's psyche. Yep, it was only a matter of time - Kirk isn't invincible, after all. It was a great set-up: both on the audience and on the soon-to-be hapless Romulans. They're cool here, as to be expected, but when up against the likes of both Kirk & Spock in full 'special mission' mode, they have no chance. These two have altered the cultures of entire planets, after all.This episode also represents an interesting insight into the culture and social politics of our sixties decade. Here we meet a commander, of either captain or commodore rank, who is (surprise) female; this was unprecedented back then, yet she is on the Romulan (the enemy) side. On our side, the Federation, females up to this point filled such occupations as yeomans and nurses only, with the occasional prosecutor and communications assist. This appeared to be all that was allowed by the powers-that-be until then, as indicated by the rejection of the 2nd-in-command female officer from the first pilot, ""The Cage."" So, it seems as if Roddenberry and the writers sneaked in this high-ranking female because a supposed villainess or enemy of high rank was deemed acceptable by decision makers - let the enemy indulge in these strange promotions and see what happens. Well, as it happens, it worked against the Romulans: it was unusual to see Spock in the role of seducer, the part usually played by Kirk (who also reverted to his crazy-eyed bonkers routine here, recalling the excesses of such episodes as ""The Enemy Within""). This was a fine thriller all-around, with unexpected twists and turns during each act, such as the unveiling of the Vulcan death grip technique, up to and including the conclusion. Oh, yeah, and Spock gets slapped again (his mom did the honors back in ""Journey to Babel"").",8
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Enterprise Incident (TV Episode 1968)",Exceptionally interesting and keeps you guessing,"I really liked this episode. The plot was pretty exciting plus it gave Spock a big chance to stretch himself as a character--without McCoy or Shatner tagging along. Also, any episode with the Romulans is great fun, as they were in many ways a more dangerous and less stupid foe than the Klingons.The episode begins with Kirk behaving very erratically. He even orders the ship into Romulan space and nearly starts a war. It seems that the Captain has gone mad and the Romulans take possession of the ship. At the same time, Spock becomes very chummy with the Romulan commander, a sexy lady who seems determined to climb into Spock's trousers. I'd like to say more, but it really would spoil the suspense. Just let me say that there is a lot more to the story than this and the show is both interesting and keeps you guessing.",8
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Enterprise Incident (TV Episode 1968)",Well Played and Suspenseful Episode,"This is a nicely paced, genuinely suspenseful episode which finds its roots in the best espionage stories. Kirk takes the Enterprise into Romulan territory on his own initiative, leading many to question his competency to command and increasing hostilities with the Romulans. Is Kirk actually losing it, or is something else afoot? This episode resembles some of the best spy fiction -- ""The Spy Who Came In From the Cold"" in particular -- and Shatner's staginess actually works to the episode's advantage. Nimoy's inscrutability is equally compelling, particularly when the Romulan commander (well played by Joanna Linville) tries to persuade him to join the dark side, as it were.Intelligently written and played, and a lot of fun to boot.",6
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Enterprise Incident (TV Episode 1968)",The best show of Season 3,"This is simply the best episode of Season three of Star Trek--and one of the top 10 shows of Classic Trek in my view. Kirk behaves strangely and appears psychologically unstable to his crew and to Dr. McCoy when he orders the Enterprise to enter into Romulan space. The Enterprise is then quickly captured by the Romulans. To make matters worse, Kirk attacks Spock in a fit of rage while in a Romulan brig before Dr. McCoy. Spock unthinkingly but spontaneously appears to kill the Captain with the Vulcan Death Grip. It looks like all is lost due to Kirk's bout of insanity...until we see how the story finishes. Meanwhile, the Romulan commander tempts Spock with several rewards and incentives to betray the Enterprise crew and allow the ship to fall under her control. Can things get even worse? Soon, however, we notice that all is not all it seems. Nurse Chapel is the one first Enterprise member of the crew to notice that something is wrong when she tells Dr. McCoy: '...there's no such thing as a Vulcan Death Grip.' At the show's conclusion, it is the unfortunate Romulan commander who winds up looking like the dunce instead. Like Hamlet, Kirk is saying to us: 'There is method to my madness. Just watch me, I'm not really crazy.' Once she becomes a prisoner on the Enterprise, the Romulan commander retains her smarts and tells Spock (who had tried to seduce her) that their sensuous contact will be their secret alone to keep. I thought this was a classy touch from her. Joanne Linville is marvellous as the emotionally sensitive Romulan commander--one of the best performances that anyone can ever dream off from a visiting cast member. This was one of Dorothy Fontana's greatest Star Trek scripts after ""Journey to Babel."" It is strange to think today that Gene Roddenberry was so afraid NBC would reject her scripts because she was a woman that he asked her to sign her plays as 'DC Fontana' instead. Talent certainly does not discriminate between gender here.",10
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Enterprise Incident (TV Episode 1968)",Strategically Interesting,"After the ludicrous ""Spock's Brain,"" this is a decent episode, worthy of praise. Kirk puts the Enterprise in grave danger by crossing into the neutral zone. Soon the Romulans are at the door, threatening to take over Kirk's ship. Their ships have been cloaked which poses a threat to the Federation. Kirk responds by threatening to blow up the Enterprise if they don't back off. This leads to an exchange of crew members, Spock going to the Romulan ship. While there, he strikes up a romantic thing with the beautiful Romulan commander. Vulcans and Romulans come from the same roots and she sees him as a potential ally. The reason this works so well is that we are not privy to what Kirk and Spock are up to. Kirk seems utterly insane and Spock seems to be a traitor, but we know, don't we? It is interesting to see someone beside Kirk putting the moves on an attractive female alien. The conclusion is satisfactory and worth the wait.",8
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Enterprise Incident (TV Episode 1968)",One the Best and Meatiest Episodes of the Original Star Trek,"Has Captain Kirk (William Shatner) not only lost his ability to captain his ship but lost his mind? At episode's beginning, Captain Kirk is irritable, irrational, and nearly insufferable. And then he takes the Enterprise into the so-called ""Neutral Zone"", an area of the galaxy which is off-limits to Federation fleet ships under current treaty with the Romulans, the nemesis of the galaxy. The Neutral Zone acts as an interstellar buffer between the Federation and the Romulan Empire. Kirk violates the treaty and is immediately confronted by Romulan military starships.Their commander is a beautiful but highly intelligent Romulan woman, simply called ""Commander"" (Joanne Linville). She is aware of the violation of the treaty and will not let the Enterprise return to Federation space without making a point. She desires to take the Enterprise and crew hostage, and to execute Captain Kirk as an example to other wayward starship captains. She then finds a strange ally in Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) who, after beaming to the Romulan ship with Kirk, confirms that Captain Kirk is suffering from delusion and insanity. An unexpected subdued flirtation evolves between the Vulcan and the Romulan. Both Nimoy and Linville play their rolls perfectly, subtly engaging but never overt. Captain Kirk appears to become more infuriated when the Vulcan appears to have betrayed both him and the Federation.This is one of the best episodes from the original Star Trek series of the 1960's. It exploits the rivalry of the Romulans and the Federation, and it has some of the best acting of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy combined with a compelling and unpredictable storyline. Highest marks also for Joanne Linville as the Romulan Commander who never raises her voice, even when she condemns Captain Kirk to death.",10
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Enterprise Incident (TV Episode 1968)",Spock and the Romulan,"In ""The Enterprise Incident"", the Enterprise crosses over the Romulan Neutral Zone in direct violation of Federation orders. A stressed and temperamental Kirk gives the order and gets the Enterprise stuck in a bad situation when a group of cloaked Romulan ships surround the Enterprise and order for its surrender. A Romulan commander orders Spock and Kirk aboard her vessel for negotiations.When the duo are aboard, the commander charges Kirk with espionage and locks him up; Kirk injures himself whilst trying to escape. The Romulan commander is attracted to Spock and attempts to turn him. Everyone aboard the Enterprise thinks Spock is a turncoat but it turns out to be all a ploy. Spock gives Kirk a ""Vulcan Death Grip"" ostensibly to kill him. But when Bones transports Kirk's body back to the Enterprise, it is discovered that he's alive. Kirk and Spock have been in on it all along via top secret orders from Star Fleet to steal the Romulan cloaking device. While Spock distracts the Romulan commander, Kirk disguises himself as a Romulan and beams back aboard the ship. He locates the cloaking device and takes it back to the Enterprise. Spock is charged with treason and sentenced to death. He stalls for time as the Enterprise installs the device. They beam him and the commander back aboard, cloak themselves from the enemy, and head back into Federation space. Spock and the commander lament their lost love but understand each other perfectly. Maybe in another life...I am a really big fan of this episode. It's really got it all: a good, fast-moving plot, good acting, a decent plot twist, and a bit of suspense. Joanne Linville is absolutely stellar as the Romulan commander. The chemistry she has with Spock is definitely palpable; even the emotionless Spock is victim to her charms.Kirk's irascibility is a nice added layer to the plot. There seems to be a rift between him and the rest of the crew at the beginning of the episode. I am currently re-watching the series in stardate order and the previous episode is ""The Paradise Syndrome"". I wrote his mood swings off as a reaction to the death of his beloved from that episode. It really adds a whole other layer to contemplate when viewed from this perspective. It actually turns out to be all an act. But for the first half of the episode, the viewer doesn't know this. It really adds some suspense.",9
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Enterprise Incident (TV Episode 1968)",That Old Vulcan Charm,"Watching this Star Trek episode again tonight I was wondering why it began with DeForest Kelley recording in his medical log his concern about the state of William Shatner's mental health. As it turns out there is a good reason and not just for viewer suspense in why Dr. McCoy duly records this. In case the object of a certain mission happens to be listening in.That object is Joanne Linville, beautiful and deadly commander of a Romulan battle cruiser. Long before Kathryn Janeway was commanding a star ship, the Romulans achieved equality of the sexes having her commanding one of their war vessels. Said war vessel has a cloaking device which gives the Romulans a strategic advantage that Star Fleet would like to overcome.William Shatner takes the Enterprise into the neutral zone and then into Romulan space whereupon three Romulan ships appear out of nowhere and Captain and Kirk and Mr. Spock board the vessel. Linville is intrigued by a Vulcan being second in command of an Earth ship and Spock while not the most romantic of figures apparently is an object of fascination for her. What's there left but for Leonard Nimoy to put on that old Vulcan charm.What then becomes obvious to the viewer is that this was a well thought out espionage mission and Linville and her libido were targeted by Star Fleet.Who would have guessed it, Mr. Spock as a Vulcan Mata Hari.",7
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Enterprise Incident (TV Episode 1968)",Has Kirk gone mad? Is Spock a traitor?,"It appears that the stress of command has got to Capt. Kirk; he is getting snappy with the crew, ordering them to redo tasks they have just competed then finally he orders a change of course directly into Romulan space! Here they are almost immediately surrounded by three Romulan ships that appear to have cloaking technology. They are given one hour to surrender or be destroyed. Kirk and Spock are 'invited' over to the Romulan where they are questioned by the Romulan commander; a rather attractive woman. Kirk claims they entered Romulan space due to a navigational error but Spock tells the Romulans about Kirk's recent behaviour; this is later confirmed by McCoy who is called over to treat Kirk. Enraged by Stock's treachery Kirk attacks him but finds himself at the wrong end of the Vulcan 'Death Grip'. As the Romulan commander tries to persuade Spock that as a Vulcan he should feel more at home with Romulans than the Federation we learn the truth behind what is going on; Kirk is not dead and everything we have seen is part of a top secret Federation plan to steal a Romulan cloaking device! It will still be dangerous though; if they are to survive they will have to steal it and get it working on the Enterprise before the Romulans realise what is going on.This was a really good episode; the opening gets the viewer wondering just why the normally rational Kirk has ordered his ship to cross the Neutral Zone. We are then left wondering just how the crew will get out of the predicament when they are surrounded. Once aboard the Romulan ship we get some great interaction between Spock and the Romulan commander; both Leonard Nimoy and Joanne Linville are great in their respective roles. It was interesting to learn more about the Romulans and nice to see that their commander was a beautiful woman after Kirk had assumed a man held the position. The first half of the story is a nice mystery about why Kirk is behaving how he is and why they entered Romulan space and the second is exciting as we see whether or not they will be able to get the device and even if they can will they be able to rescue Spock. Overall I'd say this was a really good episode; up there with the best.",9
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Enterprise Incident (TV Episode 1968)","""What is your present form of execution""?","This is certainly a Top Ten episode in my book, with Captain Kirk and Science Officer Spock playing against type for most of the story until it's revealed that they're on a secret Federation mission. The one thing that bothered me however, was why they were on this mission in the first place. Why didn't The Federation have the smarts to develop a cloaking device before the Romulans, huh? That would be on a par with, say, the Russians putting a man in space before America? Oh, wait a minute.This is a pretty suspenseful episode, with elements of intrigue and espionage that keep the viewer guessing. Captain Kirk orders the Enterprise into a Romulan Neutral Zone to the consternation of the rest of the crew, and it appears that he may have inadvertently set themselves up as an ultimate prize for the Romulan Commander (Joanne Linville). Does anyone else think it odd that the Commander didn't have a name? Said Commander attempts to romance Spock, and one wonders how it is that Spock breaks character here to be (seemingly) tempted by the Romulan's charms. There's actually a conflicting duality to Spock's nature here when it's emphasized that Vulcans are incapable of lying, yet he has no trouble feigning his willingness to become a traitor to the Federation. That's a form of lying isn't it? I guess you'd have to chalk that up to his half human counterpart.Anyway, this is one of the better Star Trek episodes, maybe even one of the great ones. It introduces the Romulan Right of Statement delivered by Spock before his 'execution', and just like the movie ""Casablanca"" that perpetuates the line ""Play it again Sam"" even though it was never said, this story introduces the Vulcan Death Grip - Whoa!! Come on, there HAS to be a Vulcan Death Grip.",9
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Enterprise Incident (TV Episode 1968)",Well done intrigue,"An excellent episode full of mysterious motivations. Has the Captain gone totally crazy? He hasn't been himself for weeks, erratic and irritable. The Doctor is worried about him. Suddenly the Enterprise is at war with the Romulans by entering their neutral zone, and breaking the treaty, apparently on Kirk's unauthorized command.The Enterprise is quickly surrounded by 3 enemy Romulan ships.OK, I will cut to the chase. The best part of this episode is the cat and mouse game with Spock and the sexy female Romulan commander. I love her dress, BTW. She is obviously interested in Spock, even apparently wines and dines him, although the colorful liquid they drink is not identified.They engage in some subdued, but classy flirtation. She offers him a command position within the Romulan empire, and some associated unnamed perks.He seems somewhat interested. Ahem! Has Mr Spock gone totally crazy? This is not like our first officer. He is only interested in sex during the Vulcan mating season.Soon it all becomes clear. Kirk beams aboard the alien vessel in disguise and steals the coveted cloaking device, which Scotty implements at the last minute. Then, Kirk and Spock are back aboard the Enterprise with the Romulan commander, whom they will drop off at the next space station. She makes a poignant statement to Spock about keeping their ""relationship"" a secret.Good episode. Nimoy, especially, is really excellent in this.",9
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Enterprise Incident (TV Episode 1968)",Star Trek The Original Series--The Enterprise Incident,"Well, after Spock's Brain, any episode remotely good would probably have sufficed. But we get much, much more with The Enterprise Incident. Some episodes are just fun. Let's be honest, though, a good deal of what makes this episode so memorable comes with the image of Kirk disguised as Romulan next to an uncomfortable (well, as far as discomfort can show on a Vulcan) Spock. When the episode begins, it appears Kirk has begun to show signs of mental fatigue due to long-term duty without much shore leave. Any question of his decisions is met with hair-trigger snaps. Then he orders the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone towards Romulan space! So the crew is a bit miffed, a bit confused, about why he'd do such a fool thing. Well matters don't get any better as three Romulan ships surround them, two designed to closely resemble Klingon ships. Has Kirk snapped and completely gone off the grid? Or is there an actual method to the madness? Obviously instead of just blowing up the Enterprise, the Romulans are a bit inquisitive about why Kirk would bring it into Romulan space, a defying of the Neutral Zone Treaty, and so the Romulan commander (Joann Linville, very good) wants Kirk to board her ship out of interest in why he's there and to demand a surrender. Spock accompanies him and seems to gain favor with Linville's Romulan, with her smitten with him! This episode actually offers the possibility that Spock develops ""feelings"" for the Romulan Commander, and the idea that a Vulcan will actually use someone so that a mission can be accomplished in securing a cloaking device was (to borrow from Spock) fascinating to watch. Of course, he uses logic during a statement (according to Romulan law, the accused is allowed to say his piece prior to conviction, punishment, and death) to explain his actions, and how they fit perfectly within the duties of a Starfleet officer. The cloaking device is an obvious threat to Federation safety, so securing it for study makes sense if you wish to protect yourself against an enemy in battle. Seeing the Enterprise actually cloaking, evading the Romulans right on their doorstep, with a Romulan Commander on board, Spock admitting that his time on her ship was perhaps far more than just a mission, The Enterprise Incident has so many memorable moments worth savoring for any Trek fan. A vast improvement over the first episode, The Enterprise Incident does stand as proof that the third season isn't a total wash. There are some great ones in that season. If anything, seeing Scotty in the Captain's chair, and later being responsible for getting the cloaking device to work, this character has a lot of importance in the development of the plot, as well. We get a good laugh from Spock being not-too-amused with Kirk continuing to look similar to him (not just Kirk, but any human), and Spock has lots of time alone with the Romulan commander. The seductive dialogue had me in ribbons, considering it was the Romulan Commander who instigates a possible ""erotic interlude"" with Spock; seeing Spock somewhat encourage it is even more of a hoot.",8
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Enterprise Incident (TV Episode 1968)",Excellent spy plot,"This is one of Star Trek's better episodes. The suspense and unpredictability is masterfully developed. Kirk and Spock seem to fall into the hands of the Romulans and seem to be loosing control of the situation when in reality they are on a spy mission retrieving a cloaking device. When Spock starts giving into the Romulan commander's enticements to become a traitor by playing on his emotions, you get the feeling that something is fishy but don't know what. For once, the female lead is not a young, dim, half-dressed bimbo. Cunning, intellectual, and forceful, this female commander is the perfect match to go head to head with Spock, which unfortunately can't be said to the females Spock gushed over later in the third season.Yes, Kirk overacts in this episode as he does in almost all third season episodes. But if you just get used to his hamminess and take it for what it's worth, it does not detract from the show too much in most cases.",8

But some of the series' best episodes can be found there, and ""The Enterprise Incident"" is certainly among them.Shatner gets to ham it up a bit early on before going into Mission: Impossible territory as a Romulan, complete with pointy ears. But it's Leonard Nimoy who really gets to shine as he seduces the beautiful Romulan Commander (And I don't use that term loosely.

Kirk being extremely stressed out without relief has fallen into a state of temporary insanity. Kirk is very snappy at all crew members and has given orders to cross into the Neutral Zone - Romulan territory. They are met with a Klingon ship approaching them and others surrounding them. The Romulans have acquired Klingon technology. Kirk has violated a major space treaty. The Romulans made a deal 2 crew members as prisoners in exchange for 2 crew members as prisoners. Kirk agrees and the Romulans made good on the exchange. The Romulan Commander is interested in Spock since he is a Vulcan. Spock cannot lie being a Vulcan and tells the truth to the Commander, while an insane Kirk listens. Romulan Commander charges the Enterprise's Kirk with espionage but will not hold the Enterprise's crew responsible. Mr. Scott is left in charge of the Enterprise and will not follow the Romulan Commander's requests - only those of Kirk. Kirk is still mad, Spock is being wooed by the female Romulan Commander and Scotty refuses to budge. Kirk requires McCoy's medical help and the Romulan's allow McCoy to board the ship and attend to Kirk. The tension builds as the conclusion draws near.It is one of the best Star Trek episodes of all 3 seasons.

Being a die hard Trekkie, I'll admit that series 3 wasn't as good as 1 and 2, but this episode salvaged the 3rd series to show it still had potential - especially after the lacklustre reception of ""Spocks Brain"". Kirk acts insane and orders the ship into the neutral zone at the reluctance of the crew. And before you know it, they are surrounded by the romulans. Kirk and Spock go over, and of course Spock speaks the ""truth"" which subsequently leads to Kirk being imprisoned by the romulans. He tries to fight back, but is eventually overpowered and declared ""dead"". All of which turns out to be a set up by the federation in an endeavour to steal the cloaking device from the romulans ship.

None of the other humans has mentioned how this episode involves events and conflicts which mirror those of real life super-power conflict in the history of your Earth.Almost nine months before 'The Enterprise Incident' aired a US Navy 'spy-ship' ( the USS Pueblo) was seized off the coast of North Korea. Two of the crew were killed by enemy fire and the remaining 80 officers and seaman were held captive for almost a year. Some prisoners were tortured.So the idea of 'ships' engaging in secret spy missions was still high on a lot of minds when Kirk and Spock launched their complex plot of subterfuge.Of other interest in the episode is the rather silly way Romulans dress; as if their entire sense of fashion was based on knitting of grandmothers. Also; in spite of some rather rude jokes- Captain Kirk actually looks quite dashing with pointy ears and eyebrows!It should be noted, sadly, that the Romulan Commanders fate, once returned to her side of the neutral Zone (given the seriousness of the cloaking device falling into Federation hands) could not have been pleasant!",8

Kirk calls a conference to comes up with options 1) Fight, 2) destroy the ship, 3) Surrender? Spock confronts Kirk for stupid decision to enter Romulan space. All this is fine, but again, it's not executed well. I see the ideas here, but the screenwriting and direction does not work. It's unconvincing. Then Romulans invite Kirk and Spock to their ship, & meet the female Romulan commander, where it is revealed that Kirk is guilty & Spock outs Kirk, Kirk calls Spock a traitor. The commander is trying to seduce/induce Spock to take control of the ship & bring it to Romulan base. Kirk is thrown in jail, hurts himself in the force field. Bones makes a house call. Kirk attacks Spock, Spock kills him with the non-existing Vulcan Death Hand to Face trick. This facilitates Bones taking dead Kirk back to the enterprise. This was all done in Amok Time. Derivative, Copy and Paste. Lazy writing.We have more scenes of the Romulan commander trying to seduce Spock. This has to be some of the most unconvincing/uncomfortable scenes of the original Star Trek.In sick bay Kirk wakes up, since the Vulcan death hand to face was a ploy to get Kirk back to the Enterprise. Bones then surgically alters Kirk to appear like a Romulan. Scott beams Romulan Kirk back to the Romulan ship where he disables 2 guards and steels the cloaking device (Device enabling the ship to be invisible).Ok please read this! 2 Guards! No locks. No alarms. No electric fence, no moat, Nothing.Spock is uncovered by the commander and sentenced to death for being a spy. Spock asks to record his testimony, giving Scott time to beam him back to the Enterprise. While this is going on the commander hugs Spock, beaming her to the Enterprise along with Spock.The Enterprise decloaks and takes off.My rating is a 5, 1 given as balance for all the Blind Faith Trek fans who give 8, 9 and 10 stars.Someone mentioned that it was forward leaning for the Romulans to give such a high command to a female, where the Star Fleet females are communications, Nurse and Yeomen, only in second in command in the pilot ""Cage"". Sorry to burst your bubble. They made this woman out to be dumb as a doorknob. Low security on the cloaking device. Spock still had his communicator. Why hug Spock as he's being beamed aboard the Enterprise. Was hugging Spock going to stop him from leaving? Dumb. She's a poor example of a commander, the worst, she loses a strategic weapon to the enemy, the Enterprise. She is a good looking woman and had a solid presence, but she needed a bit more whorish qualities to seduce The Mr Spock.Nimoy's acting in Amok Time was at least 1 or 2 degrees higher than in this. He's too mild, and maybe trying to act too cool here. It does not work. Some mentioned that after the disaster that was Spock's Brain, that this is a superior episode. I disagree. Brain was not great, but it was fun and it had great music. Brain compared to this is a masterpiece. So my dear friends, all of you who give this high marks, anything more than 5 for a copy paste story, subdued acting may want to reconsider. It's still Star Trek and they all deserve at least a 5, mediocre, worth checking out for the fun. Rating 1, for Balance.",1
19,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Enterprise Incident (TV Episode 1968)",a theoretical incursion..,"Star TrekThe Enterprise IncidentA cultural hub and by far one of the most loved and respected tale, Star Trek is created by Gene Roddenberry who wrote this brilliant concept, ahead of its time and is probably why it still doesn't fail to entertain us after these many years. It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. The series didn't seem to mature as it should have but definitely has improved on terms of implementing smarter approach, parallel plot lines and thought provoking concept.Contrary to expectations, second season failed to project the essential character development which would have give a perfect arc to the series and instead focused on different cases. In this final season the expectations are still higher as they have somehow glued their audience with their gripping screenplay and innovative imagination that doesn't flinch on pushing the boundaries.The Enterprise Incident does attempt to try something out-of-the-box but everything seems piled upon by the shallow emotions that fails to communicate through the viewers and doesn't go as anticipated even though the writing was far better than the previous episode.",
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Paradise Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",Among the very best of Season 3,"I have wanted to write about Star Trek on IMDb; it's a series I got hooked on as a kid, mourned when it was canceled, and obsessed on when it rose again in syndication in the 1970's. The problem with doing that is that the episodes have changed over time, and continue to do so; not because of the excellent remastering of the series, but because of the normal human aging process. Most of TOS is pretty good, pretty well conceived human drama and the thing about human drama is what reaches inside of us and evokes a response. As a grade school kid, I was mesmerized by the newness and coolness of it all and loved every episode though the adult story elements sailed past me; as a teen in the 70's I ached to know and latch onto what the group consensus was on the 'cool' episodes and started laughing at the corny costumes and effects; as an adult I crammed TNG, DS9 and Voyager into my head, and then I returned to TOS. As an adult I asked myself what I liked about each story, and on THIS story, the answer was 'the disarray, haste and pressure of life, and breaking what you can never fix.' From the first mention of the Tahiti Syndrome, fate gives Kirk a vacation from cares while the extra pressure on the crew of the Enterprise is crushing, as they try in vain to divert a huge asteroid. As a kid I barely remember watching this one although I know I did; but as an adult, I finally saw the contrasts of simplicity and complexity played out, and understood what Kirok must have felt in his relationship with Miramanee. And this show reached into me and brought forth something I was not expecting. When I watched ""The Paradise Syndrome"" again as an adult, I had forgotten the death of Miramanee because it did not impress the child at all. But seeing it fresh with adult eyes, three decades between viewings, I felt a solid lump in my throat when McCoy tells Kirk she can't be saved. I have seen a reviewer here trash the death scene as 'syrupy.' That was not my experience. Seeing this scene as an adult for the first time in three decades, everything that followed McCoy's pronouncement was perfectly played by everyone, the production crew, the director, the composer, the orchestra, and most especially by William Shatner. Kirk speaks with tenderness and sadness but also with the distraction of the starship captain, which is an extra layer of sadness in itself as he remembers who and what he is. Yet he carries it inside and lets none of it intrude on her final moment of life, her final moment with her husband. (I need a moment) When she finally is still, when Kirk is still and the music does that subtle swell and break that pinpoints the instant of her crossing into death, it makes me cry like a baby. In fact just writing this has made me cry again. For me, this episode is excellent, and the scene I just described is in my opinion the finest two minutes of Star Trek ever filmed. But that's me. You can certainly be critical of a few earlier moments of overacting or the low-budget guitar track on the mind-meld. You can also think about where the show was trying to go in its third season and wonder whether the fighting between Spock and McCoy could have lead to a permanent split or a somewhat wider gulf between the two of them in the future seasons that didn't happen. Certainly they weren't close at all when they were reunited in The Motion Picture. I don't let any of that intrude on my appreciation and devotion to this fine episode of a fine classic TV series, which is rightfully a cultural icon.",10
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Paradise Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",Kirk gets married,"This episode opens on a planet where Kirk, Spock and McCoy comment on its unlikely similarity with earth. They discover a strange obelisk that appears to have been created by an advanced civilisation; far more advanced that the local population who are reminiscent of Native Americans. They don't have much time on the planet as they must intercept an asteroid which is heading towards the planet; if they fail to deflect it then the planet will be destroyed in two months. Kirk decides to have one last look at the obelisk and as he calls the Enterprise a floor panel opens and he falls into a room full of advanced technology. He triggers something, collapses and loses his memory. Unable to find him Spock and McCoy return to the Enterprise and head to the asteroid. They attempt to destroy it but overload the engines; travelling on impulse power alone they will get to the planet four hours ahead of the asteroid. Meanwhile Kirk emerges from the obelisk and the locals assume he must be the god of the obelisk coming to rescue them; unable to correctly recall his name he ends up called 'Kirok. Not everybody is happy; Salish the Medicine Chief has his title taken from him and given to Kirk; not only has he lost his position he has lost Miramanee, the woman promised to him, as her position means she must marry the Medicine Chief. Kirk and Miramanee grow to love each other and ultimately he learns that she is to bear his child. Shortly afterwards the ground begins to shake and Kirk is expected to enter the Obelisk to save everybody; of course he has no idea what to do and he finds himself being stoned along with Miramanee.As this episode opens it feels like so many others where the Enterprise finds an Earth-like planet with locals who look human from a specific culture. However once Kirk loses his memory and Spock leaves to try to deflect the asteroid things get much more interesting. Kirk may have lost his memory but his growing relationship with Miramanee is believable, touching and ultimately tragic; the chemistry between William Shatner and Sabrina Scharf is better than most of the alien women Kirk gets involved with; both actors do a fine job. The conflict with Salish may be predicable but it is necessary and leads to the tragic events at the episodes conclusion. Meanwhile, for once, the events on the Enterprise do not go according to plan and we see Spock dealing with the possibility that his choices could have condemned the planet's population and Kirk. Interestingly we learn that the obelisk was built by an alien race that has rescued members of endangered societies and relocated them on suitable planets; explain why so many of the planets the Enterprise has visited have populations that look human. Overall a solid episode; much better than I had expected.",8
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Paradise Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",good story undermined by excessive contrivances,"This episode could have been executed better with a stronger premise and a larger budget. It starkly highlights the extent of NBC's budget cuts on the Star Trek TOS series in season 3. Kirk is missing and presumed lost on a Class M planet after he accidentally falls into an obelisk shaped alien structure. He then suffers from amnesia on the planet which is conveniently populated by native Indians while Spock and McCoy are forced to abandon their search for the captain for 2 full months! and return to the Enterprise to unsuccessfully to divert a giant asteroid from destroying the planet where Kirk was lost. When Kirk regains consciousness and walks out of the alien obelisk, he is seen by Miramanee, a native Indian women who thinks he is a god. Kirk then promptly saves the life a drowning child thus instantly becoming the native Indian's new medicine chief Kirok. This is all far too convenient. Important scenes are cut to a minimum and feel contrived: the sci-fi portion where the planet's obelisk activates and diverts away the asteroid from hitting the planet lasts only about 6 or 8 seconds. Spock's mind-meld with Kirk, to restore the Captain's memory seems unconvincing: Kirk repeatedly proclaims himself to be Kirok the medicine man throughout the process but then wakes up only to declare that the mindmeld worked and that he has regained his memory. Of course, a different take here is that Kirk was fighting to hold onto his current consciousness of his new life and his love for Miramanee--so perhaps that scene was properly handled after all. When Spock tells McCoy on the Enterprise that the mysterious signs on the obelisk shaped deflector are actually musical notes designed to activate the device, this important scene lasts only about 25-30 seconds with minimum feedback from the doctor. It frankly feels a litttle dull. Spock and McCoy beam down to the Earthlike Class M planet without any warning at precisely the moment that Kirk and Miramanee are being stoned to death at the obelisk by the native Indains for failing to protect their planet. Finally, Kirk's love scenes with his beloved Miramanee are--for this episode--somewhat sappy. No emotional scene of Kirk weeping or saying a final goodbye is shown after Miramanee dies. Instead, Miramanee dies and we quickly move to the closing credits. Frankly, the episode feels rushed and there are a bit too many contrivances for the story to be believable! The alien obelisk also turns about to be a giant asteroid deflector rather than say an alien observatory or outpost and accomplishes the task which the Enterprise couldn't--ie. diverting the approaching asteroid away from the planet. When you get 4 or 5 'convenient' instances like this, the plot progressively becomes less credible. I still rate the Paradise Syndrome higher than the majority of the seasons 3 shows and I can see why it was one of Shatner's favourites in this season, too. (Shatner, Star Trek Memories, p.273) It was superior to the disastrous next Trek program which followed it--'And the Children shall Lead.' Unfortunately, that isn't saying much here. This episode had great potential and fulfilled most of it but the budget cutbacks hurt its quality somewhat. Still this Margaret Armen script worked well overall.",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Paradise Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)","One of the best episodes, for me","I refuse to get PC about an episode of Star Trek, so I could care less if an Indian played an Indian, etc. Acting is SUPPOSED to be just that, acting. I would rather see a good, trained actor playing an Indian or an Arab or an Englishman than a bad actor of ANY ancestry. It is a long established tradition of the theater, that a truly good actor can play many roles, and should be lauded for it.Now on to this episode. It's probably my absolute favorite episode from all three seasons. I find it far more compelling than say, City of the Edge of Forever, which many cite as the best episode ever of Star Trek, whilst simultaneously deriding this episode. I never understood the double standard. As far as City on the Edge of forever, many seem to dig the power of Kirk's relationship with Edith Keller, but I don't see it. I never got the feeling that Kirk knew Edith Keeler very well, and although he may have been smitten with her, she could not have been considered his ""mate"" by any stretch of the imagination.Cue The Paradise Syndrome. As one reviewer here noted, the final two minutes of Miramanee's life bring me to tears, and I will forever hold that it is SHE not Edith, who is the love of James Kirk's life. They had lived together for months as man and wife. She had even conceived his child. So, in my book, Kirk WAS married. I wonder why so many who discredit this episode because of its depiction of native Americans are also quick to dismiss this marriage as valid? Some might say it was because Kirk had lost his memory and was not ""Kirk"" but I don't buy it. He was still himself inside. He still dreamed of the ""Lodge in the sky"" (how poetic is THAT!) And he remembered enough of his past life to administer CPR. But I digress:The episode is beautiful, and the fact that Miramanee carried Kirk's baby is a bit shocking even today. Certainly it was powerful stuff back in 1960's television. It was touchingly and sensitively acted by William Shatner, et al. (Shatner was an award winning Shakespearean Actor before Star Trek, many seem to forget that).One could really feel the power of his attraction, not just to Miramanee, but to the simplicity and purity of living in a pristine world of Pine forests and roaring campfires; to the sound of the owl at night under a blanket of bright stars unassailed by pollution. This is a world we all came from and it still holds power for many of us, this natural humanity as lived by the native Americans of the planet.The end is a bit of a triple knock out for Kirk, losing wife, child, and a primordial natural existence far from the cares of his first love, The Starship Enterprise. His bitch mistress who cares not whether his personal life is fulfilled, but whose fate is intertwined with his forever.A beautiful, lyrical episode that touches my heart. And kudos of the wonderful remastering and high quality presentation.",
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Paradise Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",Stay away from the lodge and maiden of your choice.,"The only show from the final season to venture out into the sunlight, this Jud Taylor-directed saga registers highly as one of the best from that third season's roster. It was in the lead-off position and had to come out fast. The budget must have burst a leak at the purse strings and a good deal of cash spilled away. And so the rest of the season had to be sacrificed--like Kirk's wife and child--for the good of this production. Nevertheless, the dollars spent are present on screen, and are well divided between special effects and dramatic elements. The musical score by Gerald Fried is lush, emotional and thunderous, but never sappy. I like how the story unravels over a period of months. The actress who plays Miramanee enjoyed numerous roles of rebellion and angst throughout the Sixties. I have ""The Paradise Syndrome"" at home in my collection. I think because it poses legitimate questions about Man's place in the cosmos. Pine trees replace ship beams for a greater organic effect. A mammoth asteroid and giant obelisk (covered with ancient writings) produce impressive set pieces, as well as obstacles, for the captain and the rest of the crew to contemplate and decipher. Spock solves the riddle. He always does.",10
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Paradise Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",A clever and sweet love story,"Anybody who thought the end of this episode was sappy has never been in love.I really admire the way this episode slipped in an explanation for why the galaxy contains so many humanoids. Definitely the best of the 3rd season and one of the best of all the original ST series.Interesting that IMDb requires reviews be 10 lines. No wonder so many reviews blah blah for so long.The episode did not explain why the planet looks like the southern California hills, but maybe the same aliens who set up the temple also terra formed the planet? This episode does a good job showing Scotty's devotion to the engines, even as he is asked to put unreasonable demands on them. The episode also explores the McCoy-Spock argument over emotional reactions vs. logical analysis effectively, showing how both approaches in the extreme can lead to incorrect choice.",9
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Paradise Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",Kirok's Tahiti Syndrome (or: Kirk's Vacation),"Behold the god who bleeds! (the one great line). Behold a tribe of re-located American Indians. Behold a planet with the exact same vegetation as Earth. 'What are the odds?' Kirk muses. Is Kirk kidding? I place the odds at billions to one against, but they've already found a planet with the exact same continents as Earth (""Miri"") and the 'Roman Empire' planet in ""Bread and Circuses."" What's the big deal? The odds look pretty good in the Trek galaxy. So now we have a 'Tribal American Indians' planet - but at least with an explanation: apparently some ancient alien race likes to displace doomed cultures from Earth to other planets. Now, in a set of circumstances I calculate as millions to one against (or, in the Trek universe, very likely), Kirk accidentally opens a hidden floor panel on a mysterious obelisk with his communicator, falls inside and gets zapped by amnesia. Spock and the rest of the crew, unable to find him, have to leave the planet to head off an approaching asteroid. The better scenes, as with a couple of other episodes, turn out to be the 'B' storyline on the Enterprise, where Spock really annoys Scotty by placing too much strain on the ship's engines.With us so far? Kirk now exits the obelisk, gets spotted by a couple of females from the tribe and is assumed to be a visiting godling (the uniform must've given it away). Some tribe members are skeptical, but on a 1 in 10,000 chance (a certainty here), he resuscitates a drowned boy, thereby assuring his super-stud, main man, head honcho, favored status. However, he makes an enemy, the former medicine man (Solari) and that's where the whole bleeding god scene comes in. About two months pass. That's right - 2 whole months for this episode! While Kirk, er, Kirok exults in his new found life of nearly carefree abandon, hugging himself in ecstasy and running around the woods with his new wife(!), the Enterprise retreats before a steadily-closing hunk of rock almost the size of our moon. The theme in this one involves placing Kirk in a scenario completely divorced from his usual duties and watch his 'other' true self emerge - the gentle, unhampered Kirk existing in all of us working stiffs. This all sounds very ambitious for a TV episode, but Shatner's over-emoting, hard-to-buy-into plotting and a slipshod pace does it in, undoing much of the tragic impact at the end. I was more interested in these unknown advanced aliens, who may be the same unseen puppeteers of ""Assignment:Earth.""",6
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Paradise Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",Better than Expected Acting Saves an Unusual Episode!,"This should be just awful. Another Alien Artifact. A backward culture. Hammy acting by Capt. Kirk. But it isn't. Kirk loses his memory (and his way) after being zapped by an alien ""asteroid defector"" left on a planet populated by ""Native American Indians"" transplanted there by a benevolent advanced alien race. Of course, they speak English, or do the ""Trekies"" carry a universal translator somewhere on their utility belt? Kirk takes a fine ""holiday"" from the rigors of being a Starship Captain. He is called ""Kirok"". As usual, he ""goes where no man has gone before"" and gets his beautiful new wife pregnant. The Enterprise can't deflect or destroy a ""planet killer"" asteroid, because their power supply has gone ""flat"". A good-looking set and partially-filmed on the backlot instead of totally indoors on a soundstage. Also featuring Capt. Kirk's ""usual hand-to-hand combat scene"", tumbling down a hill. Of course, Spock returns just in time to use the alien obelisk to deflect the asteroid away from the planet. Kirk's ill-fated wife dies on the primitive planet from her wounds. (Why wasn't she beamed up and treated on-board the ship?) The crippled, impulse-powered Enterprise somehow limps home. It's actually far better than it sounds. It is well-written with relatively decent acting and direction. The ""Indian"" culture is treated with respect and shows wisdom, not ignorance. (O.K. they are wrong about just one thing: Kirk is not a God.) One of my favorite Season Three episodes.",8
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Paradise Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",Get Kirk ?,"I just watched one ST episode that I fully intend to never watch again: ""The Paradise Syndrome"".I see a woman wrote this one... and I don't think she was thinking logically when she did it. Kirk disappears, McCoy rants about not leaving orbit while he's missing, so he & Spock beam back up, the ship departs-- late-- and they didn't leave one person behind to search for Kirk, not even a medic in case he was hurt?Kirk can't remember who he is (I hate ""amnesia"" episodes), but when they decide to make him ""Medicine Chief"" for saving the child's life, he doesn't object. He doesn't offer to teach the actual Medicine Chief how to do the mouth-to-mouth resuscitation thing so HE would become an even better Medicine Chief. And though he seems surprised when Miramanee announced they're to be married, he doesn't object to that either. (I suspect Rudy Solari's character was really hurt the most when Miramanee didn't answer him when he asked her, ""If you did have a choice, would you choose me?"" I guess for her, he would have been just following tradition. You'd think she could have found a way to let him down a little easier, wouldn't you?) Man, those Enterprise engines sure seemed to burn out easily, didn't they? Is this Scotty having a bad run of luck, a writer who hasn't been watching the show enough to pay attention to the ship's ""technical"" history, or just a writer with a certain ""agenda"" and they're not gonna let anything stand in the way of telling the story they wanna tell, no matter what? (""Beneath The Planet Of The Apes"" feels like it was ""written"" that way, too... heh) So Spock fixes Kirk, and Kirk orders Scotty to get out of orbit once they pass the safety point, ""The landing party is expendable."" WHAT? 4 of the most important people on the ship, and they wouldn't beam them up first? And what about even trying to rescue ALL those other people, the way ""The Gatherers"" did? What is this, bad fan fiction? Gotta hand it to those Gatherers. They not only plant these people on a nice planet (albeit one in recurring danger of asteroids, thus requiring an asteroid deflector!), they somehow know, centuries in advance, that Kirk would activate his communicator and say what he did and use it as the audio trigger to open the temple.Let me not forget to mention Rudy Solari's father, who out of sheer arrogance and stupidity, put all his people and the entire planet in mortal danger, all because he didn't want to tell his son the secret of operating the ""temple""-- ""too soon""-- and died before he got the chance later on. Stupid, stupid, stupid! (I wonder how he was supposed to get in without Kirk's particular key words? And how odd they had 2 ways in-- the regular way, and the special way, foretold by the prophecy.)It's so ironic, at the beginning of the story, they didn't want to show themselves to the Indians, and tell them of the danger... yet, if they had, they'd have soon found the Indians knew of the danger, and, what was needed to avert it! ""Primitive"" culture, eh? I suppose the cool moment in the entire story was when Kirk tells Spock, ""Just-- push the right button."" And he does. One button. WOW! And it does what the entire power of The Enterprise was unable to do-- and much better. That's some technology.The music in this one makes me think someone was watching ""This Side Of Paradise"" and they wanted to do for Kirk what that episode did for Spock, both story-wise and music-wise. Damn thing, it's so pretty it's almost too painful to sit thru...Finally... are we really supposed to believe that with all the future medicine on The Enterprise, that McCoy couldn't save a woman from a simple stoning? Get outta here...! By story's end, I began to wonder if this hadn't started life as a ""Bonanza"" episode. After all, when one of the Cartright boys falls in love, by the end, the woman always dies!",4
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Paradise Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",TOS's the Inner Light,"I found this episode to be an entertaining and pleasant chance to really test shatner's acting abilities without having to overact(though he still does). This episode reminded me of TNG's famous episode the Inner Light where Picard experiences a lifetime in the space of 20 minutes as a different person. This was similarly done here to a lesser extent, with an amnesia filled Kirk experiencing around two months of a new life as kurok.The episode goes as follows. The enterprise detects an asteroid that is on path towards destroying a planet whose inhabitants resemble native Americans. Kirk and the gang beam down to investigate this primitive civilization and encounter a strange obelisk that Kirk enters and gets quickly zapped in getting amnesia. Spock leads the landing party back(much to the chagrin of Doctor McCoy) in order to destroy the asteroid and prevent the destruction of the planet. While Spock goes on his solo mission Kirk is mistaken for a god by the inhabitants of planet Navajo. He goes on to live his life and get married to a local girl, Miramaly?Mirlany?Milwauke? who knows. Anyways Kirk enjoys his vacation with an idyllic godly lifestyle until his wife's old suitor comes along and basically attacks him, so biff cuts Kirk and discovers he's not a god creating some doubt in the mind of kurok(what amnesia Kirk thinks his name is). Spock meanwhile fails at destroying the asteroid and manages to damage the system in the process, to the point that warp drive is disabled, basically they'll have four hours when they get back to the planet to get out f there before the asteroid destroys the planet. Spock seems mesmerized by the obelisk and keeps his research going discovering the markings on it are actually musical symbols. Meanwhile in planet Cherokee, a dangerous storm hits and the natives ask the supposed god Kurok to save them. Kirk ends up not being able to stop the weather(not very godly Kirk) and naturally the inhabitants pelt him with rocks. Kirks wife chooses to go to her husband despite not being a god and they both get stoned together, get a room you two. Spock and McCoy arrive in time to see Kirk near death and restore his memory, they decipher that Kirk somehow said the necessary vocal notes when speaking to the ship and opened the obelisk. They reenact kirks communication and go in to the obelisk where they activate the asteroid destruction laser (duh). Kirks wife dies and everything's back to normal.Now while my summary of the episode seems unflattering. I really could get behind Kirks love for his native wife, but more importantly for his happiness albeit temporary, at a normal life. This happiness came with struggles though, the normal menial farmers life isn't for Kirk, and no matter how good it felt to be afflicted with Tahiti syndrome our good old captain discovered what we knew all along, he belongs on the enterprise. The death of his wife was believably frantic and I think well done, she didn't seem like Kirks conquest of the week but rather, like she really mattered. Spock in charge and the insubordination that occurs is always fun, and it was a nice change of pace with no baddie of the week. All in all a fine episode of TOS, and one of the better ones of a lackluster third season.",8
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Paradise Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",Chief Kirok Warps the Injuns,"The Paradise Syndrome begins in a surprising way--instead of space or some obviously alien environment, Kirk, Spock and McCoy find themselves in a lush forest reminiscent of the Pacific Northwest in the U.S. It's a remarkably Earth-like planet ""half a galaxy away"". The planet is sparsely populated by what appear to be American Indians living in a traditional way. But there are bigger problems--a large, Moon-sized asteroid is headed the planet's way, and if the Enterprise crew doesn't quickly get back to the ship and warp to the asteroid's vicinity to knock it off course, there's a good chance it will completely destroy the ""Shangri-La"". Of course things can't be even that easy. Kirk goes missing in short order, and Spock and McCoy are left with an even bigger dilemma.Kirk accidentally ended up inside a large, obviously alien obelisk near the Indian encampment. Spock and McCoy decide to head back to the ship before they can find him to take care of the local Armageddon problem. Meanwhile, Kirk gets zapped and loses his memory while fiddling with the mysterious controls inside the obelisk (I guess he set the controls for the heart of amnesia).Which finally brings us to the home territory for the episode--Kirk adapting to life in the Indian community as they mistake him for a God, and he tries to remember just who he is. There's a slight Return of the Jedi quality to this. The set-up provides a lot of amusing material, although no Ewoks, as we get to see Kirk running around in various Native American getups, and at one later point, even bellowing out his possible Godhood in a last-ditch attempt to not make a complete ass out of himself. Yes, it's ironic, and it's one of the highlights.Of course, there's a love interest for Kirk, or ""Kirok"", as he comes to be known in his deified form, and also a jealous party (an ""Indian"" who looks oddly like Gene Simmons) so that Shatner gets to do a few of his patented moves in a fight sequence, like his chaotic flying sidekick. The corniness and uniqueness (for ""Star Trek"", at least) factor arrives strongly with some idyllic, maybe even syrupy, romance film moments, and Kirk's love interest becomes probably his most serious yet. Another campy highlight related to this arrives near the end, when imminent doom is at hand, but Kirk just can't stop staring at his loved one in order to try to prevent everyone's deaths.The few moments aboard the Enterprise are far from the most exciting and suspenseful material in the series, but we do get some classic Spock/McCoy bickering where they both turn out to be right for once, and in an even more unusual moment, Scotty's Chicken-Littlish cries about the engines prove to be on target for once. It's also a heck of a lot of fun to note that the Enterprise apparently rides through space in reverse for two months just before the climax.This episode has plenty of corniness, as I mention above, and that's usually enough to push ""Star Trek"" up a notch for me so it gets a higher score. That's one of the things I love about the show, as I keep mentioning in other reviews. But something about The Paradise Syndrome just doesn't flow right, and it's not just the fact that in spite of ""Star Trek's"" putative policy of promoting multiethnicity, there's not a Native American actor in sight. The problem is rather that The Paradise Syndrome plays as if most involved parties' minds were elsewhere, from the writers to the director to the cast. This is one of the lesser episodes, but even a lesser episode of ""Star Trek"" is still fun and entertaining.",7

The horror of Kirk's overacting!,"Kirk and the landing party head to a planet directly in the path of a huge asteroid. It is doomed to strike unless they can do something. They are surprised to see both a thriving tribe of American-style Indians and a huge statue-like device that was obviously put there by some beings of an advanced society. Kirk accidentally activates a door and falls inside the device and suffers amnesia. By the time he is able to leave, the landing party has left in an attempt to avert the catastrophe. And, stumbling outside, he is immediately mistaken by the simple folk as a god!!! This is a pretty popular episode and I seem to be in the distinct minority in not especially liking this one. My biggest problems were the whole idea of finding American Indians on other planets (what's with that?!) and Kirk doing a massive amount of overacting as the god, Kiroc. When he stands on the pedestal and yells ""I am,...KIROC!!!!"" I can't help but laugh. Subtle this episode isn't nor is it especially good. Plus, all too many times, what happens next is 100% predictable. For example, when he marries a lovely lady, you know she is doomed!",5
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Paradise Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)","Strange premise, strange execution","Indians in space! This episode starts with a strange premise: Kirk gets lost among Native American Indians on an alien planet, gets amnesia, and is considered a God. With bad acting thrown in, it just goes downhill from there. The love scenes between Kirk and the Indian girl were just painful to watch; they were classic late 60's/early 70's cheese. People tune into Star Trek to see space ship battles and alien worlds; not to see the hero frolic mindlessly through the meadows with an Indian girl to syrupy flute music. In the beginning, as soon as Kirk encounters the band of male and female Indians, you just know which one Kirk is going to fall in love with: the one with the pretty face and form-fitting outfit. Once they marry, you just know she's going to end up dead so that the show can reset for the next episode. In the end, everything seems to be unraveling when Spock heals Kirk's amnesia with a mind meld (that seems to be a lazy script-writer's solution to everything) and pushes one button to deflect the asteroid: anti-climatic! The whole subplot about deflecting the asteroid and deciphering the obelisk had a lot of potential. If the producers had cut out the love story and Indians, and focused solely on the asteroid and obelisk, it would have been a lot more interesting.",3

Don't bother to explain how they evolved or any of that unimportant stuff. Put the planet in danger from an asteroid and stick Kirk on the planet with amnesia. Have him absorbed by the Native American population. Since Kirk has no idea where he is or how he got there and begins to believe the tribe when they tell him he is a god. He is immediately targeted by the medicine man. He hooks up with a beautiful young Indian woman whom he marries. The obelisk where he was when things went awry is the solution to the problem but Kirk can't remember and Spock and McCoy are back on the ship. Kirk is even about to be a daddy. Just how much time transpires here. That's another question. It isn't that this isn't half-way decent storytelling, but what happened to science fiction. The plot is about a guy who has no idea what's going on, who must defend himself against adversaries he does not understand. It is so incredibly contrived as to be laughable.

I got hooked on this from the beginning, and here we have another of the most powerful---and the most stressful---of the lot: the Vulcan mind-fusion. When Spock asked Dr. McCoy ""Is he strong enough for the Vulcan mind-fusion?"" he knew that this was the only way to break Captain Kirk's amnesia, and when Bones replied ""We have no choice"" he recognized once again the Vulcan's formidable mental powers---as he had done from the very start---and he also recognized the possible danger in implementing this procedure. Fortunately, it was successful---but it also knocked the wind out of Spock (imagine! Spock out of breath!) who exclaimed ""His mind...he's an...extremely dynamic individual!""

It's an idyllic location by a wooded lake in the mountains with a small tribe of 18th century American Indians encamped in teepees by the lake. Kirk is enchanted.They immediately discover a large, out of place, concrete obelisk with hieroglyphic-looking characters all over it - obviously too advanced to have been built by the Indians. Kirk orders Spock and Bones to look elsewhere while he investigates the obelisk further.While they're apart Kirk decides to call the Ship as he stands on the base of the structure.

Kirk survives the stoning but Miramani, his Indian wife, does not. Meanwhile Spock figures out that the obelisk is a big asteroid deflecting device, figures out how to get inside and operate the thing...and... presto!

Usually you have the Enterprise making it's way through space with some different colored asteroid in view heralding the next adventure. The opening here introduces what looks like another Class-M planet, and Captain Kirk asks, what by this time the viewer must be thinking - ""What are the odds of such duplication""? In order to oblige, Gene Roddenberry and writer Margaret Armen finally offered an explanation for the dubious million to one shots that seemed to arrive with incredible regularity on the show. They came up with the idea of The Preservers, ancient beings who passed through the galaxy 'saving' doomed civilizations and then 'seeding' them on planets where conditions for life were much more hospitable. The effect was the appearance of so many humanoid beings that the crew kept running into.Well, that takes care of that. But now you have to explain Captain Kirk as a Native American Indian, saving the life of a young tribal boy, earning the right to become the Medicine Chief, and marrying the tribal priestess already betrothed to the man Kirk, that is, Kirok replaces. Considering the alien adventures the Captain and crew have already experienced, it's almost comical seeing him in an Indian get-up while frolicking through the forest giving chase to his new 'wife' Miramanee (Sabrina Scharf). Oh, and by the way, Kirk/Kirok has amnesia, so he really doesn't know what he's doing here, except that it's the best he's felt in a long time.It's the action of Spock aboard the Enterprise that grounds this episode back to Star Trek reality. He has to come up with a way to deflect a moon sized asteroid from obliterating the Indian home planet while pushing the Enterprise to it's physical limits. What's curious is the idea that this story takes place over the course of a couple months, long enough for Kirk to settle down and get to the business of starting a family. Of course it never gets that far as events play out with Miramanee dying, presumably with child in womb, but the odd thing is that that's never mentioned. I guess one is supposed to presume that to be the case, but why not just make it official? You probably get the idea I didn't think much of this episode, and that would be the case. Somehow the story line is just too disconnected with it's references to the obelisk, musical notes, The Preservers and Native American Indian traditions. And the Tahiti Syndrome. Nor did it help that Kirk went way over the top shouting 'I...am....Kirok!' when he was exposed as the god he never claimed to be. Thank goodness for Vulcan Mind Fusion.",7

The Enterprise cannot find Kirk, nor can Spock and McCoy. That leaves Spock in command and he orders them to leave the planet and to deflect the asteroid. McCoy protests but Spock reminds him that all will die on the planet including Kirk if they do not deflect the asteroid and they beam back aboard and leave.

Well we all know that Kirk will be saved - no question about it.Weak episode, not all that good but it is Star Trek so it's not all that bad either.

The natives remarkably resemble Native Americans.While investigating a strange, futuristic monolith in the forest, Kirk falls into a secret compartment and gets zapped by some electricity, resulting in short term memory loss.

After realizing that he cannot, the tribe stone him and his pregnant wife. The wife is killed. The Enterprise beats the asteroid by a few hours and Spock, who has been researching the symbols on the monolith for months, knows how to make it work. It turns out that the people on the planet were actual Native Americans, taken from their home centuries ago by an alien race to populate the galaxy. This explains why there are so many humanoids resembling earthlings all over space. Kirk leaves his life behind and resumes command after a Vulcan mindmeld brings him back. Budgetary constraints meant a lot more ""human"" aliens in later season episodes and this script at least tries to explain this away. I commend it for that. But otherwise, this is a poor episode.

They would show an earth culture on the show to give viewers a point of reference.

I won't go any further other than to say that Nimoy and the rest of the Enterprise crew go through quite an experience to save him and the planet.It was an interesting story idea.

Because of course, Kirk having a wife and a child on another planet (or would they have taken her onto the ship with them?) would have just complicated things, so it's easier to just get rid of her.

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. The series didn't seem to mature as it should have but definitely has improved on terms of implementing smarter approach, parallel plot lines and thought provoking concept.Contrary to expectations, second season failed to project the essential character development which would have give a perfect arc to the series and instead focused on different cases. In this final season the expectations are still higher as they have somehow glued their audience with their gripping screenplay and innovative imagination that doesn't flinch on pushing the boundaries.The Paradise Syndrome has a unique structure and is a character driven episode and in such features, the execution should be upto the mark which is the missing puzzle in here.

There's a problem with putting children into adventure shows: they slow down the plot and they are typically very bad actors. I put this episode up there with Spock's brain and Hippies in Space as the worst Star Trek episodes. All three have one common element: annoying adolescent antagonists.

Shouldn't alarm bells be ringing here among the Star Trek personnel? Predictably enough, the children soon take control over the starship with supernatural telepathic powers and direct it to Marcus 12 under the influence of a 'friendly angel' called Gorgan (played by Melvin Belli). The children manipulate the Enterprise crew to do their will and nearly have Kirk arrested as the captain struggles to regain command over his ship. Once Kirk eventually breaks Gorgan's spell by playing a tape showing the children playing with their parents on Triacus and then their parent's terrible deaths and graves, the children cry and see Gorgan's true evil nature. Kirk is back in command and everything returns to normal. McCoy then says ""its good to see the"" kid's cry. Children--especially several children--do not make plausible science fiction subjects. Its hard to believe that this plot is realistic: that a bunch of kids can take over the massive Enterprise without quickly eliminating Kirk from the picture. Almost all the Enterprise crew--including Scotty, Uhura, Sulu and Chekhov fall under their spell...but the equally human captain Kirk is immune from their mind control? There are just too many plot holes here! Belli's performance as Gorgan is also poor since he was really an attorney, not an actor.

These are some of the better scenes in this episode which proceeds at a limp pace in the first half, starting at a decimated scientific colony. The foot soldiers of this new threat turn out to be little children or, as I term them, brats. It recalls another low-rated episode which also had many kids, ""Miri."" They run around, playing their games, annoying Kirk (Capt. Picard on the TNG show also could do without children), and ignore the fact that all their parents have just died.Mystery in space. The reveal is, certainly, a letdown: real-life famous attorney Belli is the culprit, materializing every time the kids voice a silly chant. Belli had no acting experience or ability that I could see, literally seeming to 'phone in' or 'project in' his performance. He resembles a holographic image, dressed in a weird robe, and I could kind of imagine that his scenes were filmed separately, matted in to the show later. No explanation is given for what his so-called evil character really is (a fallen angel? an alien lawyer?) and I found I didn't much care anyway. There was also a misconceived use of the transporter which, as depicted, cannot automatically detect the absence of a planet, even though it's the most sophisticated piece of hardware in the Federation. Any entertainment value stems from the scenes of our crew behaving in a strange or hostile fashion, such as Chekov's attempt to arrest Kirk and Spock.

For starters, noted criminal attorney Melvin Belli appears as a demonic influence on the orphaned kids of a planet whose parents all died in a case of mass suicide. I wonder why that was. Belli had a single handful of casting credits during his legal career, and this was his first one. Is it possible he did some attorney work for one of the series principals and this was a form of payment? Not only that, but his son appeared as the leader of the kids, Steve, fist pumping his evil spell on the Enterprise crew. I'd be interested in finding out the story behind this casting call.The other interesting point, and I noted it even when I saw this for the first time many years ago. Out of the blue, without any prior mention of Belli's character name, Captain Kirk calls him the Gorgan. How did he come up with that? I was waiting for some explanation having to do with the type of evil influence that the specter represented, but nothing ever came of it. Then, as I was thinking about THAT, I had to chuckle over an old sci-fi flick from a decade earlier, 1959's ""Teenagers From Outer Space"". In that picture, aliens land on Earth in search of a planet on which they can graze their livestock, which are these goofy silhouetted lobsters that crawl across the screen. Those lobsters were called Gargons!The notable contribution this story makes to the Star Trek canon is the idea that mind control leading to herd mentality can be a poison to a culture - ""Without followers, evil cannot spread"". It's always easiest to get young minds to follow a charismatic leader when they're at their most vulnerable, particularly following a tragedy. That these kids helped produce the tragedy was taking it a step further, and was something of a daring idea for Roddenberry and his crew.",7

Now I would like to state that this is in my opinion the worst episode of TOS and possibly even the entire franchise.The basic plot is, Kirk and the gang are sent to a planet to retrieve a group of children whose parents committed mass suicide, the kids however seem entirely unfazed by the recent death of their parents and are almost glad they're dead(or if you want to be more analytical are in denial). We soon learn that the kids are in contact/under control of a mysterious alien spirit angel??I honestly don't know, what I do know is that this mysterious alien is played by a real life famous attorney in his acting debut, which apparently from what I know of the story was a publicity stunt by the producers to increase the amount of viewers. Anyway the evil angel lawyer convinced the kids that they need to go to a federation colony so that he can spread his influence and take over the galaxy(Yes he tells the kids he wants to take over the galaxy, but hey kudos to the evil angel lawyer, real ambitious), he in turn promises to the kids that basically he will tear down the fabric of society and plunge the galaxy into anarchy, so yay no bedtime. Now(and this is when it starts to get really ridiculous) the kids manage to fool the crew into heading to the federation colony by pumping their fists at them which makes them see silly illusions and apparently lowers the crews iq. So it's up to Kirk to stop these damn kids and yet while seeing them nearly kill him several times, Kirk refuses to do any thing to the kids! I mean you don't have to lock them up in the brig or anything but at least confine these demon brats to quarters! So while a bunch of illusion nonsense goes on Kirk eventually shows the kids that they were happy with their parents and gets them to accept their parents death. This in turn destroys the evil angel lawyer.Now while a lot of reviewers connected to this by watching as kids, and I get that, and while they did attempt to pass the message that evil cannot spread without followers, and that children are more susceptible to become said followers. They did so in such a horrendous and laughable way that I swear to god I thought I was having a stroke halfway through.

Gorgon (Belli) possesses the children of scientists after the dead alien race were reactivated by the officers discovering them on the planet, a cave releasing them. Gorgon's race were marauders who caused terror and death before themselves vanquished. The kids' parents send out a distress signal which brings the Enterprise but by the time they arrive the scientists were found dead by apparent suicide. The leader of the science research team is the last to die, right before Kirk, Spock, and the away team. The kids, however, seem emotionally unfazed by the deaths of their parents, with Bones believing the cause a shock response hindering the grieving process...until Gorgon is revealed to be the culprit. The kids do this hand/arm pumping technique when unleashing the Gorgon mind illusion on the Bridge crew with Spock and Kirk overcoming the possession. Anxiety and mind altering influence beset the crew, giving Kirk and Spock all kinds of trouble. Kids on the Bridge ruling over the crew, with a course instead aimed for a planet offering millions of fresh victims, Gorgon appears to be in full control. But just maybe Kirk and Spock can fracture Gorgon's hold on the kids if they see what it was like before their parents were killed, and then produce evidence of the death that happened to them because of the evil of their master. Sulu seeing daggers on screen, Uhura seeing her old age face mirrored back to her, Kirk speaking backwards to a security officer, two redshirts beamed into space which clues Kirk to the fact that his ship was off course, Spock unable to redirect course back to the planet they were orbiting, and the crew coming under heavy anxiety with Chekov and security planning to place Kirk and Spock under arrest all resulting from kids possessed by an ""angel"" summoned through a chant who looks to them to help his race returning to their old ways is a bit too much for this Trek fan. The kids giggling about, gathering a takeover, all smiles and villainy, causing the grown-ups to come unglued or at their mercy, with Kirk commenting to Spock that he might have to kill them (!), this episode is widely considered one of the series'low points, and rightfully so. If anything just the visual of the kids running rampant and overtaking a galaxy class starship while the adults play patsy to them is laughable. ""Miri"" this is not.",2
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" And the Children Shall Lead (TV Episode 1968)",Great Trek!,"I'm a bit embarrassed to rate it 10 out of 10 after reading all the negative reviews, but this has always been my favorite episode. Maybe it's because I've watched Star Trek my whole life (my mom was a Trekkie) and so, as a child, I liked watching things starring children. That being said, I still think this is a great episode. Are there a few plot holes (in particular the fact that no one reminds Kirk that they stranded a few security guards on an uninhabited planet)? Sure there are! I think that's part of the beauty of the show! No offense, but there were bigger plot holes in other episodes. Case in point, The City on the Edge of Forever... Once McCoy steps through the time portal, the others have no contact with the Enterprise. They're told that all they knew was no more because McCoy screwed up something in the past that changed the entire future. If that's the case, how the hell were they still there on the planet?! For that matter, if that were the case, they wouldn't have been there to have McCoy mess things up... See? It makes you feel like a confused Norman in I, Mudd, doesn't it? Star Trek is full of plot holes and head scratching moments, but that's its charm! I think the appeal to this particular episode is the fact that it's a psychologist's dream. You've got children being misled and being used as a tool for evil, they're all in denial (more like totally oblivious) to the fact that their parents are dead, something most children would be devastated by. Not to mention that the crew is made to face some major anxieties that I think most of us can relate to at least a few of ourselves. And it gives a good view of what can happen when you trust people who promise you anything your heart desires. The acting of the children was just wonderful! They were quite believable in their roles and I think they meshed well with the normal cast. But don't take mine or anyone's word for it, watch it and decide for yourself.",10
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" And the Children Shall Lead (TV Episode 1968)",Yes one of the better season three episodes,Yes I agree with my fellow Trek fans in their comments. Season three has received much criticism - and in my opinion some of it is well deserved - but there are positive aspects as well.But there are about six very decent episodes which would have stood up quite well in the previous two seasons (Including this one) - 'Let that be your last battle field' 'All our yesterdays'' The Savage Curtain' - The Thiolian Web' (of course many of you will beg to differ - but these are my favourites.I like this episode because it highlights how children can loose empathy and appear uncaring (an all to real modern day trait).

""Don't mind our captain, he's most likely been affected by the anxiety- causing atmosphere on that strange planet you just came from. Maybe that's what happened to your parents too.""""Parents? What parents?"" Tommy the tall red-head glared at Captain Kirk. ""We don't remember any parents. We don't have to tell you about no stinking parents!""""Bones, let me handle this,"" Kirk said smoothly. ""Unless I hear the truth – about what happened – to your parents – there will be no more ice cream cones!""""Ah, I got your cone right here."" Tommy grabbed his crotch and squeezed. ""Try it with nuts."" ""That does it!"" Kirk lunged for Tommy and caught him in a headlock. Then a call came from the bridge. ""Captain, Spock here. Strange phenomenon on the bridge screen. Please come at once.""Up on the bridge, Spock indicated a sexy young man sprawled out shirtless on the view screen. Kirk couldn't place the alien. ""Abraham Lincoln?"" He asked. ""The Greek God Apollo?""""My name's Jim,"" said the god-like figure in black leather pants. ""You wanna beam me up?

It was awesome to hear ""Crystal Ship"" and ""Soul Kitchen"" coming through the ship's speakers late at night, instead of all that horrible warbling by Uhura. But soon the Lizard King was encouraging the kids to misbehave. They lurked in the corridors, pumping their fists and making stuff go wrong. And now they had a leader.""You're all a bunch of slaves!"" Jim shouted, stirring up the Red Shirts in the crew lounge. ""I don't know about you, but I plan on getting my kicks before the whole s---house explodes!""""That's enough, mister!"" ""What you gonna do, man?"" Morrison mocked.

""These kids are my friends,"" Morrison crooned, drunkenly. ""Soon, we will go to your Star Base, and make even more friends. And the children shall groove. All those who dig our trip will be our friends. Those who do not will be destroyed. They got the guns, but we got the numbers. We want the world and we want it now!""""We want the world and we want it now!""""Look at him!"" Kirk shouted. ""Is he a kid like you? Look how drunk he is! He's not only a grown up, he's the worst kind of grown up. How long before he has a big beer gut? How long before he's floating face down in someone's bathtub?""""That's a lie!"" Tommy shouted. But Jim Morrison was starting to change. His belly was getting fat. His beard was getting longer and longer. And his voice sounded raspy and worn out. ""Kill the father,"" he moaned. ""F—the mother. Kill the father. Kill the father. F---the mother.""""That's what destroyed your parents!"" Kirk cried, pointing the finger like a prosecuting attorney. The kids started to cry. ""Take it as it comes,"" Morrison shrugged. His face was bloated, pasty. He tried to unbutton his leather pants and expose himself, but his belly got in the way. He collapsed on the floor and writhed around like a Crawling King Snake. Then vanished into thin air. ""They're all crying now, Jim,"" Bones McCoy said quietly. ""I guess you knew what you were doing all along. Now the healing can begin.""""Captain, I never will understand earth men,"" Spock said, a few days later. The ship had been cleaned up after Morrison threw up all over everything, and the children were undergoing intensive counseling combined with medication. ""You knew all along that Morrison was the source of the children's bratty attitude, yet you insisted on beaming him aboard."" Kirk shrugged, back in his favorite chair on the bridge. ""I always wanted – to see the Doors – do their thing live, Mr. Spock. Say what you want about Jim Morrison, he was a rock and roll legend. Four centuries haven't changed that.""Spock lifted a thoughtful Vulcan eyebrow. ""Perhaps in the end, only the truly dark emotions make rock and roll possible. All the great rock legends seem to have been exceptionally bad men. Elvis, Morrison, Cobain, Chang-twang Lee . . . the only exception might be Bono. But on Vulcan, he's regarded as something of a pussy."" Dr. Leonard McCoy flared up at once. ""Spock, you obviously have no appreciation for the achievements of Bono. Or Bruce Springsteen.

OK maybe not, I probably saw this in a repeat, but at an early age it stuck out. McCoy utters his trademark phrase here, ""He's Dead, (put in either Jim, or Captain, or whatever)"", and we see some flowers on the Enterprise along with a lot of ice cream and flavors! The ending is a serious tear jerker for a young kid, so that word of caution, the moral is not to forget your parents. As I have seen in my personal life, its a message that may need to be reinforced in today's youths, sigh (like my own). Season three as I am viewing the DVD set here starts off OK, not nearly as strong as season two's start (which kind of whimpered out to season three's levels), but its still decent Trek.

All through the story I was holding my breath,wondering how Kirk and Company would deal with this, and the first inkling came when Spock, after saying ""Why are we bothering Starfleet?"", shook that off. The turning point came later when Spock got the captain off the bridge even while Tommy kept pounding his fist over and over and Kirk was lamenting losing command. The incredible Vulcan got Kirk's attention and used his full telepathic powers---you should have seen the intense concentration in his face---to force the demon from the captain's mind and restore his control and command; at that point I could relax, especially when Spock asked ""Where to?"" and Kirk, now himself again, replied ""To auxiliary control, my Vulcan friend---this ship is off course!""

I believe they've all contributed to my growth in one way or another.This episode had a profound impact on my young mind (I saw it at the age of about 9, I guess). I realized that whether we are children or not, giving in to temptation is ultimately going to erode our self-respect and possibly endanger our life or others' lives. I also realized that what we want and think we should have or even think we need is not something we can always determine for ourselves--child or adult. Finally, I came to the conclusion that those who we meet up with in life who want us to have whatever we want--no matter who they are-- are not necessarily acting in our own best interest. We don't always need a ""yes"" man. Oftentimes, what we most need is someone who will say ""no"" or ""that doesn't look good"" or ""it's time for bed"" or even ""you shouldn't do that."" Ultimately, I guess I could also say that I learned that what looks good on the surface isn't what's really good, and what looks bad, isn't necessarily bad. All good lessons. Thanks, Gene! :)",10

While exploring the site Kirk goes into a cave and suffers a feeling of total dread which passes when he leaves. Back aboard the Enterprise the children appear happy but start behaving oddly when their parents are mentioned. Alone they chant and summon an alien being which tells them to take the ship to Marcus XII. It soon becomes apparent that they have some strange power which enables them to tap into adults most basic fears and to trick them into believing they are still orbiting Triacus when in reality they are heading to Marcus XII. Kirk and Spock manage to break the children's grip on them and struggle to regain control of the ship; frequently having to confront their own crew in the process.This episode is somewhat weaker than average but it isn't terrible. Starting with the faults; the children are initially somewhat annoying, the alien isn't particularly threatening and the hand-pumping action the children do each time they use their powers is just silly; surely there could have been a better way of showing they were using a power. On the plus side the children were pretty creepy once we realised what they were up to. The acting here isn't the best; I wasn't surprised to read that Melvin Belli, who played the alien Gorgon, wasn't even an actor. Overall a bit of a disappointment.",6

They decide to take the children aboard the Enterprise and transport them to the nearby Starbase 4.But the children have other plans. Led by an ancient being from the planet's surface, the children plan to divert the Enterprise to a nearby, heavily populated planet. It's not super clear what their plan is after this but they seem to want to make more friends.

All this is via their ""friend"" the Gorgon who has ordered them what to do. Spock and Kirk are able to overcome this inner beast and fight back.

0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Is There in Truth No Beauty? (TV Episode 1968)",One Look and You Go Mad,"I've always had a problem figuring out the point of this episode. Is it the age-old adage about not judging a book by its cover? That surface appearance usually hides something else within? We are introduced to a new kind of alien in this one, a Medusan (refer to the myth of Medusa), a member of a race evolved into a formless type of energy that one carries around in a box. Colloquially stated, it's too ugly for humans to gaze at - it would drive a human being insane immediately. But, it probably has more to do with a visual spectrum that human eyes can't handle, rather than the traditional concepts of beauty and ugliness. Well, maybe that's it right there: yes, maybe there is no real beauty or ugliness, except the prejudices we humans project onto everything. There's a brief discussion of such during a dinner scene in this episode. Not too profound, but we're still exploring facets of human nature most other TV shows never touch upon.Like with many 3rd season episodes, this one is afflicted by a slow pace in spots, i.e. it's deadly dull in places. Case in point: one scene has Kirk trying to distract Miranda, the alien's human associate, while Spock proceeds to the alien's cabin; we see Spock walking down the ship's corridor; then back to Kirk & Miranda; then back to Spock, still in that corridor. Suspenseful? No, just slow. All the male crew members seem really taken with this Miranda character, even though she's a real cold fish - ah, yes, she hides an ugliness within her, despite her surface beauty. Well, I never really felt there was this great ugliness in her, just an uninteresting self-absorbed personality. The action stuff is well done: the p.o.v. of a crazed person is shot with a disorienting camera lens, lending a suitably warped flavor to the scene. But when Spock's body is once again appropriated by an alien, you get the uneasy sense that Trek in its 3rd season is running out of ideas: it was done better in ""Return to Tomorrow."" The ending is somewhat anti-climactic. Take note that Spock wears the IDIC symbol on his uniform in this episode.",6
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Is There in Truth No Beauty? (TV Episode 1968)","""Don't look, Spock!""","Tonight: ""IS THERE IN TRUTH NO BEAUTY?"". Whatta ya know. Some things actually GET BETTER with age. I never cared for this show when it was first-run, and only tolerated it when I was a teenager and beyond. Yet tonight, I really enjoyed this thing.Lots of fans complain about how every alien race that turns up on STAR TREK is either humanoid, humanoids with bumps on their faces, or ""fake"" looking rubber suits. Not this time. For once they came up with an alien race that is TRULY alien in every possible way, and so bizarre that they couldn't even show it. (Of course, if the TV audience saw it, they'd all go insane and die soon after.)One really inspired scene is when Kolos, merged with Spock, comments on the human condition. For the most part he's delighted-- until he realizes just how ""alone"" each of us is living in ""this shell of flesh"". Thought-provoking, to say the least.I finally ""got"" the whole thing about them being caught in some kind of other-dimensional area, that was somewhat confusing before. I think this episode is just the kind of thing that could never appeal to kids, or even most teenagers, but at the age I am now (50) I guess I'm just ""complicated"" enough (as Miranda called Kirk) to get into it. It was nice to see the ""plant"" room again, used much better here than when it debuted in ""And The Children Shall Lead"".I still wonder what it was Kolos said (or did) that made Miranda SCREAM the way she did.Something I found rather annoying, if not downright completely disconcerting as a kid, was the new music this time out (George Duning) and the way director Ralph Senensky went completely berserk with camera movements, camera angles, and camera LENSES. There's stuff in this episode NOBODY had ever done on STAR TREK before here. Even something relatively ""simple"", like the shot in the Engineering section, looking from the center of the room out toward the entrance past the little side room with the controls on the wall. I may be mistaken, but I don't think anyone ever lined up the camera that way in any previous episodes. I guess he really wanted this one to stand out.You know, oddly enough, this story now begins to remind me of an early-1st season episode-- the kind the networks wouldn't have wanted to see. Gene loved ""intelligent"" stories, I think. There was also one shot of a hallway crammed with crewmen-- something not often seen since the first 13 episodes. There's also bits that remind me once again of THE OUTER LIMITS. Not something that was crossing my mind for the bulk of Season 2 or the other season 3 episodes so far.And speaking of THE OUTER LIMITS... David Frankham, who played ""Larry Marvick"", had earlier been in ""Don't Open Till Doomsday"", one of the most inexplicable and terrifying episodes of that show, in which he was trapped for decades with an alien inside... A BOX. Talk about typecasting-- I mean-- what are the odds???Never thought I'd say this, but I think for once, Fred Freiberger did something he deserves to be proud of! If only they hadn't run the damn show 10 o'clock Friday nights. I was lucky to see this the first time out, but at least a third of that season I missed-- because that year, STAR TREK was the ONLY show left worth watching for me on Fridays, and since we never left the TV on unless we were watching something, Friday after Friday, I kept forgetting my favorite show was even on!Finally, I know some over the years have accused Gene Roddenberry of shameless self-promotion, by having Spock wear the ""IDIC"" medallion (once as a pin, later on a neck-chain), which was a product specially created for Gene's mail-order side-business, but I always thought it was a cool idea, a cool design-- and I wouldn't mind having one of those.",6
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Is There in Truth No Beauty? (TV Episode 1968)",Plausible sci-fi and introspective themes make this one a gem,"I was surprised by the reviews on this message board. I consider this to be one of Star Trek's best episodes. Star Trek tends to portray two types of aliens, both implausible: aliens that are essentially human with minor plastic surgery, and abstract clouds of light/energy. In reality, aliens are more likely to be like the strange creatures we find on earth such as jelly-fish or electric eels: distinctly non-human but still contained in a well-defined body of tissue. I like this episode because the alien, Kollos, is a clever concoction, is very alien, and yet is plausible. Kollos is not some nebulous blob wafting through space, but instead sits inside a transport pod that humans carry about. If humans look directly at Kollos, they go insane. It should be obvious that it is not Kollos' ugliness that drives men mad. Rather, Kollos emits a frequency and pattern of light that damages the human brain and it is the brain damage that makes the men mad. This is much like an epileptic having a seizure if they see flickering lights. A creature with this effect is quite alien and yet very plausible. The crew takes precautions to not look at Kollos, but still treat him with respect, he being an ambassador for his people. Kollos' telepathic interpreter, Miranda, can mysteriously see Kollos without going mad. In a clever plot twist, we learn later that Miranda can do this because she is blind.The action is well acted in this episode, giving a real sense of suspense. Additionally, the story's exploration of the nature of beauty is thought-provoking.I only have two gripes with this episode. First, I found it annoying how every male on the Enterprise was obsessed with Miranda's beauty. I know this was somewhat central to the episode's theme of the nature of beauty, but the producers could have done it more subtly. The seniors officers of a flagship military vessel are a disciplined lot. They aren't rendered into babbling fools every time a pretty girl walks in the room. The whole effect just fell flat because Miranda wasn't even that pretty. Secondly, the odd camera angles were very distracting. I can give the camera crew some leeway for trying to spice up the aging third season with some novel camera angles, but there were far too many in this episode. The strange camera shots really took away from the episode.",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Is There in Truth No Beauty? (TV Episode 1968)","""Gentlemen, here's to beauty"".","Diana Muldaur made her second guest appearance on Star Trek in this episode, the first time back in Season II as Federation Doctor Ann Mulhall. Captain Kirk got the chance to get chummy with her that time too, but he had an excuse. He and the Doctor allowed some disembodied space aliens to 'borrow' their bodies to learn a bit about human experience.This one might have been more appealing if Muldaur's character were written with a bit more congeniality. Even so, I thought the story was fairly compelling, especially with the hook that Miranda Jones (Muldaur) developed her telepathic abilities on Vulcan because she was blind. The Captain registered his surprise quite convincingly when Spock revealed his knowledge of her, and the idea that her dress operated as a highly sophisticated sensor web was a uniquely creative one.I like the idea posited by another reviewer on this board that the Medusan Ambassador's ugliness was in fact a visual spectrum outside the normal realm of human vision. That could account for the insanity that was the penalty for viewing a Medusan without a protective visor. Considering all the TV variety shows of the era like The Smothers Brothers, the Sonny and Cher Show and the like, it might have been a good idea to have those visors available back then. Those mid to late Sixties programs featured an awful lot of colorful psychedelic accompaniment to the rock bands that appeared on those shows.Considering Marvick's (David Frankham) important contribution to the Star Trek universe as a designer of The Enterprise, he wound up getting treated quite shabbily in the script, going insane and all. Chances are he didn't need the Medusa touch to go bonkers, his unrequited infatuation with Dr. Jones was probably enough. Or maybe it was because everyone called him Larry instead of Lawrence.",7
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Is There in Truth No Beauty? (TV Episode 1968)","Watchable, but kind of dumb","I just don't get some of the big premises of this episode - that Miranda is so remarkable, and that there's anything so ugly it would make you insane. Someone here made the remark that maybe it's the frequency of the light waves or something rather than it being ugliness. Miranda is just a jerk. The episode is slow, inconsistent and way too talky. I also don't quite understand why Kolos is an ambassador - why doesn't the Federation just leave the damn Medusans be? There's one part I do like, when Kolos is speaking through Spock about the loneliness of the human experience. Overall, I love TOS and even at its lamest, I'll always tune in.

No one on board seems to notice--maybe it was the hair. Regardless, this time she is not the receptacle for a god (see the previous episode) but is a very famous lady with magical powers that enable her to communicate and see a Medusan without going crazy (the standard human response). Unfortunately, the man that is most in love with her is a few cards short of a full deck and he tries to kill the Medusan ambassador (who, oddly, lives in a small crate--this is a lousy way to travel). And, unfortunately, Muldayr isn't wound all that well herself. What happens next is kind of dumb and by the time the episode was over the first time I saw it, I was pretty relieved. Watching all the men on board go ga-ga over Muldaur was pretty silly and the acting of Spock when he briefly went crazy was pretty campy. Do yourself a favor--if you haven't seen the show before, pick a different episode.",4
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Is There in Truth No Beauty? (TV Episode 1968)",Star Trek: The Original Series - Is There in Truth No Beauty?,"Diana Muldaur returned in a far more showy part than the previous episode featuring her (""Tomorrow is Yesterday"") as a blind human telepath with a link to an alien ambassador, Kollos, from the race of Medusians known for their hideous ugliness, which causes those who look upon them to go mad. When a brilliant designer of the Enterprise decides he will kill Kollos out of pent up anger because Muldaur won't love him despite his feelings for her, looking upon the Medusian drives him insane, causing him to tamper with engineering (Scotty and other officers attempt to stop him but his mad drive overcomes their efforts), resulting in a warp speed that sends the ship into an unknown void out of their galaxy. Only Kollos will be able to help Kirk and the Enterprise but that would mean linking with Spock, two entities together in a Vulcan body allowing the Medusian to pilot the Enterprise out of the void and back where they came from. Muldaur's Dr. Miranda Jones was a fascinating and complex character as she hates pity, spent time on Vulcan to learn how to combat and resist the flooding human emotions that could paralyze herthe Vulcan way does allow her to prevent them from overcoming her. Jones, though, is not willing to share Kollos, aware of Spock's respect for the ambassador and need to connect with him. Her beauty has a way of ensnaring the desires of those around her. Conversations on beauty and ugliness are obvious considering the symbolic name of the alien scripted as hideous while Muldaur is quite the sight for sore eyes. Once again Nimoy can present another personality, this time an alien unfamiliar with human flesh experiencing ""the shell"" for the first time as if a babe introduced a new world. The conflict isn't as much of ""ship lost in a place of unknown origin"" as Spock and Jones competing for a link with Kollos. The debate over what is considered ugly is of great importance. The IDIC insignia gets some focus, regarding ""diversity"", which interestingly shows up in a film questioning views on races idea of beauty/ugly. Kollos might be ugly to humans, but what about how we might look to Medusians? And Jones can't see and she is basically in love with Kollos, so looks aren't everything. Kirk will need to appeal to Jones, by confronting her about the jealousy towards Spock for his interference in linking to Kollos in order to rescue him from madness when he accidentally views the Medusian with his own eyes. In the case of Jones, the episode ponders if she is all surface beauty with an ugly inner being. The message is more than a bit loud, but it does speak on matters that still have prevalence today.",7
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Is There in Truth No Beauty? (TV Episode 1968)",The dangers of jealousy,"The Enterprise has been given the task of transporting Kollos, the Medusan ambassador. The Medusan's are a race whose beautiful thoughts are matched by an outward ugliness will render any human who looks upon them dangerously insane. This means the only member of the crew who can go near Kollos is Spock; and even he must wear a special visor. Kollos is accompanied by the beautiful telepath Dr. Miranda Jones who explains that she can look at him thanks to skills she learnt on Vulcan. Also travelling with them is Lawrence Marvick, one of the designers of the Enterprise. During dinner Dr. Jones senses that somebody is having murderous thoughts; it turns out that Marvick is jealous that Miranda would rather spend her life with Kollos than him and intends to kill the Medusan. He fails though and is driven insane; in this insane state he seizes control of the Enterprise and takes in far beyond the edge of the galaxy. The only way back will be for Spock to perform a mind meld with Kollos so they can use the Medusan's navigational skills this leads to more jealousy; this time from Miranda who doesn't want anybody else joining with Kollos.This is a rather enjoyably episode with three distinct sections; firstly Marvick's actions which take the Enterprise out of the galaxy, then Spock's joining with Kollos to get back and finally the consequences of Spock accidentally looking upon Kollos as they separate. One thing that permeates the whole episode is jealousy; Marvick's jealousy of Kollos, which leads to his insanity and ultimate demise and Dr Jones jealousy of Spock which nearly leads to his demise. The use of a fisheye lens nicely captures the insanity suffered by Marvick and Spock as we see the action from their point of view after they look upon Kollos. Guest star Diana Muldaur does a fine job as Miranda and it is good that we get minimal views of Kollos as any attempt to make a creature as ugly as he is meant to be would inevitably be a laughable failure. Overall a good episode with strong character led story but not lacking in action.",7
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Is There in Truth No Beauty? (TV Episode 1968)",poor production of a trippy idea,"Another weak third-season entry, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane. It's too bad the episode cannot live up to this incredible premise. Obviously, I think, it was a mistake to ever 'show' the alien, as its actual visage in no way even approximates such a daunting build-up; all we get is the standard Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any event, Kollos' appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor. (For the longest time, I thought the alien's name was 'Carlos,' which I found humorous, but I digress.) Spock is required to mind-meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety. This is accomplished, but when Spock/Kollos go back to end the mind-meld, by golly, Spock forgets his visor. Uh oh. He goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. This might have been a really bizarre, excellent episode but it is poorly directed and comes across as yet one more badly executed show of the series' last season.",4

Give me some Klingons, Gorns, Tholians, Romulans, higher beings like Triskelion's or anything but Medusin's, these are very boring aliens to make an episode around. McCoy gets to utter his famous phrase ""He's Dead, Jim"". Spock puts on the protective goggles when transporting the ambassador away but Kirk does not.

At least season three's next episodes would be ""Spectre Of The Gun"", and ""Day of The Dove"" and others to follow, making Trek a decent show to watch in syndication where it would pick people like me up as avid fans. Personal observations, Trek loved to use the color purple, its kind of a pinkish purple, like when they are in the corridor outside the compartment, the gangway that is normally grey is now purple.

If you didn't read William Shatner's book, allow me to break the bad news: Roddenberry didn't create the IDIC medallion out of some form of altruism. It was pure marketing. He did it to milk as much money as he could out of the die hard fans of what was then a dying series.

You wonder why this poor sap who ultimately went insane was so madly in love with this cold bitch.

It's essentially a science fiction love triangle that relies more on the abilities of the thespians to carry the story with their skill than the writers.That's not to say that the story isn't interesting, but it's not as deeply thematic as the stories of the first two seasons, and there's a spartan quality that pervades the third season because of budget cuts. Therefore the story is kept simple. The story is essentially a love triangle when a jealous lover driven to rage acts out, and consequences ensue.The performances are first rate. Where the plot is lacking (in fact, there's hardly a plot at all) the basic story and actors carry the episode. There is a distinct lack of action though a bit of interpersonal intrigue, and the exploration of a character who is unusually handicapped. To me this is a decent episode, worthy of more than the mediocre criticisms and praise that have come from other fans of the show. It's actually better than a few of the second season episodes in spite of its lack of plot elements. If you're not a fan, then give it a shot and see what you think.",

The Medusan ambassador Kollos is accompanies by a telepathic human aide named Miranda, who claims that her life of training on Vulcan allows her to see him without insanity ensuing.A scientist aboard happens to be a scorned lover of Miranda's. In a fit of jealousy, he attempts to murder Kollos, predictably causing him to go mad. He takes over control of the engines and shoots the Enterprise out of the galaxy into a disorientating patch of space. Only Kollos's ultra-intelligent mind can bring the Enterprise back. But he needs control of the bridge, something that is obviously infeasible. Spock must attempt a mindmeld with Kollos, merging the two men into Spock's body. Miranda feels a special connection to Kollos and attempts to stop this from happening. But Spock wins out and the two merge and help the Enterprise reenter the galaxy. Miranda sabotages Spock out of jealousy, trying to make him go mad. A now sick Spock needs a mindmeld with Miranda. Kirk is able to convince her to do it and everyone ends up back to normal. Kollos and Miranda are now linked.This episode's plot is extremely clunky. I really enjoy the idea behind it but the execution is poor. The premise that something is so ugly it causes insta-madness is a bit laughable, so I prefer to accept that it has something to do with patterns of light like one user recommended. If we can look past this, there's something to this episode. Unfortunately it becomes extremely muddled in the middle. We also sit around having a philosophical conversation that really isn't all that deep or meaningful.It's also aggravating how all the officers aboard the Enterprise fawn over Miranda like she's an Orion female or something. She shows little in this episode to make me buy into her character.As it often happens in Season 3, this episode's plot is a significant issue.",4
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Is There in Truth No Beauty? (TV Episode 1968)",What is beauty? Well it isn't kolos,"This to me was an all together good episode, the enterprise wasn't fighting a galactic race of evil baddies, but rather the problems stemmed from the governor coming aboard, kolos. Governor kolos was a member of a species so physically ugly that it would literally drive you insane, but on the inside the governor was a kind genius. This was a simple metaphor for the classic what's on the inside is what counts, while also looking into blind people and their limitations in the real world (when given telepathy). The episode wasn't to me particularly analytical but it did question what is beauty, who judges what beauty is and why, which I found relatively interesting, albeit not original.The episode goes as follows..The ambassador of an alien species is beaming aboard (kolos), as mentioned before he is so ugly it drives any human insane by looking at him, Vulcans however have an immunity when wearing x ray goggles (and I thought those things didn't work). So Spock operates the transporter and beams up kolos and his assistant, dr Miranda jones (dr Pulaski), Spock's never before mentioned rival. She is human but supposedly was taught in Vulcan and so has little to no emotion. Now Miranda spends the first ten minutes being constantly told how beautiful she is and then turning down Larry something, the guy who also came to help kolos, so naturally Larry something attempts to murder kolos, but there's one flaw in this brilliant scientists plan, he looks at kolos (seriously he looks at the thing he knows will turn him insane, what people do for love). So Larry something goes insane and takes over engineering, where after a good minute off button mashing he gets them well out of their known universe. Larry then dies when he sees Miranda, due to (as McCoy describes) nothing at all. Now incredibly kolos species are expert navigators and so they need him to take them back, so Spock decides on doing a mind meld with him so as to be able to bring them back, but Miranda won't have it, she and Spock are bitter rivals remember. So Kirk distracts Miranda by trying to tune into her emotions while Spock goes to do the meld, Kirk is immediately unsuccessful and Miranda has a tantrum, she wants to meld with kolos but as we learn, she can't as she wouldn't be able to navigate the ship properly, as she's blind. So kolos tells Miranda that he'll meld with Spock, and he does, Spock then instantly gets them back on path, however when he melds kolos consciousness back to his body he forgets his x Ray goggles and goes insane. Spock's tranquilizes and it seems Miranda is the only one who can rescue him. She is reluctant but Kirk gives her one of his famous species on emotion and accountability and ..., so Miranda saves Spock and all is right in the world.All in all a calm episode, nothing really felt as though the enterprise was going to be in extreme danger, it was cool however to see that a starship can jump halfway across a galaxy through button mashing (maybe janeway should have tried that).",7

He is jealous of her fixation on the Medusan, not romantically but rather in her choosing this life over one with him. He decides to kill the Ambassador but in the process, looks upon it, causing him to go berserk and gain control of the ship, driving it to the edge of the galaxy. For some reason, Muldaur's character is unwilling to help in any way. Spock has the ability, using his mind meld, to take on, in human form, the Medusan. She refuses (I don't know why, other than Spock's ability to telepathically connect with other species).

However, right after the opening credits, it's been rolling downhill.There are many things that make this episode not feel like Star Trek at all: The pace is extremely slow, as opposed to the usually dynamic and fast story development of ST. The odd camera movements and wide-angle shots combined with psychedelic music make the scenes feel more like an avant-garde experimental film. Finally, there are many scenes where the characters just seem lost and act in a way that is just very untypical for them, as if it was the actors' first day of filming and they weren't sure how they should portray their character (I'm looking at you, awkward dinner scene).Overall, not a particularly bad story, but I feel like it's been artificially stretched out to hit the 50 minute mark.

The Melkotians don't take kindly to visitors, however, and, as a form of punishment, seemingly send the 'big five' (Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Chekov) to a warped version of Tombstone, circa 1881, based on information they plucked from Kirk's mind. When I saw this episode in my early years, my first thought was that the budget for the show had really been curtailed by this point: they couldn't even set up a complete 'Old West' town - what, they ran out of wood? Was wood too expensive by this time? Of course, I missed the key line of dialogue from McCoy: the characters themselves realized the town was incomplete. Bits and pieces were selected from Kirk's brain, creating a surrealistic hodgepodge of history and stylized staged drama. I wasn't even acquainted with the term 'surrealism' when I first viewed this episode, young as I was, so it wasn't until years later that I started to appreciate the gloomy dramatic elements of this eerie ghost story - an almost nightmarish stroll among some phantoms and shadows of a violent past era.When I was younger, my favorite moments in this episode involved Kirk's somewhat comical attempts to communicate 'his reality' to some of the residents of this half-baked town: to the bartender, to the cowardly sheriff Behan, and to the main antagonists themselves, the cold-eyed Earps. But, in my later years, these scenes became the weaker aspects to the story: why was Kirk wasting his time running around trying to convince apparitions of who he really was? Why waste time trying to make peace in the face of a predestined, preordained clash of wills? Make no mistake, minutes after their arrival to this fake Tombstone, the 'landing party' has already deduced that they're trapped in some strange illusion; they're not sure of its exact nature yet, but they realize it's some replay of history, a recreation of reality, but unreal in essence - they know the aliens tapped into Kirk's mind. So Kirk's lame efforts are at odds with the nature of this storyline - the thing's a head trip and those scenes stray from the premise, as if Kirk is trying to make meaningful contact with natives of just another planet, as with most episodes.To me, the strengths of this episode are the moments when the Trek-makers adhere to the eerie play of shadows premise: the Earps and Doc Holliday are the best sample of this; they're consistently portrayed as some ghostly, almost demonic versions of lethal western characters. I wonder what direction the actors received for their portrayal - probably something like 'act as if you're zombies.' Morgan and Wyatt in particular come across like some bizarre wax figures come to life. The stylized presentation of the 'not quite there' town, as if half of it is trapped in another dimension, remains a trippy excursion into Twilight Zone territory, exemplified by that clock hanging in mid-air where a wall should be; the viewer's mind is also drawn to that clock because we're constantly reminded of how it's closing in on 5:00, the time of our heroes' doom. It's a countdown to doom, quite effective. Oh, and, Chekov is shot and killed in this episode; yes, this is Chekov's final episode...just kidding.

Favorite part, the gunfight of course, and Spock saving the day, as he has done in countless episodes, the Enterprise and it's crew are toast were it not for having a Vulcan onboard! Some have commented on the sets used, I think they were awesome. The sets were cheaply made for budget reasons but in the end it shows up so much better that this is sci fi and that the aliens have a limited capability to recreate memories. I've seen this episode in the double digits now but it's still great entertainment and is highly rated.

Usually, when Star Trek does a ""novelty"" premise (Nazis, Ancient Rome, etc.) it makes little sense and drags down what might have otherwise been a great episode. But the ""Old West"" novelty premise here is great because the aliens plucked it from the mind of Kirk; there's no tortured and unsuccessful attempt to explain how an Earth culture could exist light years away.And the basic plot works well, too. The characters get quickly, efficiently thrust into danger, do perfectly rational things to get out of it, and the threat remains lifelike. And a clock counting down might be a clichéd way of keeping the intensifying danger in the audience's mind, but, like everything else in this episode, it achieves its aim very, very well.And of course, the characters work well. The five heroes behave here as the familiar, competent, human team who make Star Trek the beloved institution it is. Their interactions are believable and the five show the personalities perfectly. Walter Koenig gets a special nod: he gives us Chekov exactly as he should be portrayed: irreverent, short-tempered, and brave. The only drawback I find in the whole episode is that the character Wyatt Earp, the main villain, was not developed enough. If he's going to be Kirk's main foe, we need to hear from him more.Some people might dismiss ""Spectre of the Gun"" as a third season failure, but I give it nine out of ten. The whole thing fits together and runs like, well, clockwork.",9
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spectre of the Gun (TV Episode 1968)","""Is this a dead man, Doctor""?","Wow, with all the reviewers on this board saying what a terrible episode this was, you would think I could be swayed. Not gonna happen. For one, I'm a Western TV and movie fan, and the genre is my favorite. Secondly, I've done a little research on the Gunfight at the OK Corral, and the whole Earps vs Cowboys theme. I could probably ramble on about the inconsistencies with this episode and the real events as we know them, but Roddenberry and writer Gene Coon from the outset threw history out the window with a reasonable explanation. The Melkotians had only a limited ability to adapt Captain Kirk's memories of 1880's Tombstone, and that would have to do. Fair enough.Where I do agree with some of the critics has to do with the Captain's response to events as they were unfolding. Instead of applying some of Spock's logic to the situation, he attempted to convince the town folk that he and the rest of the Enterprise crew were from another time and place. Really? Like that was going to come across as logical?Where things got interesting was Morgan Earp's (Rex Holman) shooting of Chekov/Billy Claiborne. The real Claiborne ran off from the OK Corral showdown, as did Ike Clanton, Kirk's alter-ego. So with events not paralleling Earth history, Spock reasoned that most of what they were experiencing was an illusion. It's a good thing he had that Vulcan mind meld thing going to position the landing party for a successful face-off with the Earps and Holliday.With all that, I did get a kick out of a couple of minor points. Just like you had back in the Old West, the town barber doubled as a dentist - 'Teeth Pulling by Appointment' the sign said. And how about that clock hanging out in thin air the way it did. Maybe the idea was to salute another classic movie Western - 1952's ""High Noon"". In that picture, the clock on the wall had an ominous presence as it ticked away the hours and minutes to Gary Cooper's final showdown.",8
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spectre of the Gun (TV Episode 1968)","A great TOS episode, especially for fans of Wyatt Earp","I hadn't seen this episode in ages, but ordered it for inclusion in a set of Wyatt Earp films I am putting together as a collection. I have to first say, this is a great episode in general. I was laughing all the way through it. You have your classic Kirk moments. For example watch Kirk peek around the bartender to get a look at Morgan Earp at 14 minutes in. Hilarious.You also have a classic Scotty moment with his love affair with liquor. And you have your classic Chekov moment when he gets involved with a young lass.And of course you have your totally classic Spock moments. Spock gets off at least two good ""fascinating"" remarks, and rebuffs an attack on his feelingless persona from the Doctor with great aplomb. He also gets a nice string of logic analysis dialog. Here's just one example: ""You don't seem to understand Captain. It did not function... but it MUST function. But if the tranquilizer does not function, which is clearly impossible... then a radical alteration of our thought patterns must be in order."" Later Spock gives us a lesson in questioning the nature of reality aka Morpheus in The Matrix movie (the good one) when he explains that the death of Chekhov (at the hands of Morgan Earp's 6-shooter) is likely just an illusion: ""Doctor, in your opinion, what killed Mr. Chekov?"" The doctor replies ""A piece of lead in his body."" Spock shakes his head and says ""Wrong. His mind killed him. Physical reality is consistent with universal laws. Where the laws do not operate (as in the bendable nature of ""reality in the matrix), there is no reality. All of this is unreal. You made you examinations {of Chekov} under conditions which we cannot trust. We judge reality by the response of our senses. Once we are convinced of the reality of a given situation, we abide by its rules...Hey folks, what's not to love?? Anyone who pans this episode simply does not get the the humor, philosophy, and characterization of Star Trek TOS. Period.From a Wyatt Earp perspective this episode plays great. The producers lined up some great actors to play Wyatt, Morgan, and Virgil Earp. These guys come off as REALLY SCARY. Doc Holliday was cast well too. Any of these actors could have pulled of their roles in a serious movie production of the gunfight at the OK Corral.And speaking of 'The Gunfight at OK Corral', as mentioned elsewhere DeForest Kelley had played the part of Morgan Earp in that film. In fact, Kelley was slated to reprise that role in the ""sequel"" to 'Gunfight' in 'Hour of the Gun', except he was busy filming on the set of... guess where... STAR TREK! Little did he know...The 'deeper meaning' of this episode is one of many morality tales played out in the series where an alien race stress-tests the human civilization to discover mankind's true colors.Finally we get a nice closing send off with Spock raising a dubious eyebrow over Kirk's assertion that mankind has overcome its instinct to kill. Let's hope this Lee Cronin script is prescient.",8
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spectre of the Gun (TV Episode 1968)",A PROVOCATIVE EXPLORATION...,"This unusual episode might well have been subtitled ""Enterprise meets 'Twilight Zone' ""---there are a number of such elements here. It's also a provocative and intriguing exploration of the nature of reality vs. illusion, and as I watched it, not just once but many times (which goes to show just how hooked I am on this original series), I found myself speculating on various aspects of this exploration---not the least of which was the stupidity of the Melkotians for not doing their homework! They should have known that the information they gleaned from Kirk's mind was erratic and inconsistent, so they could only come up with an illogical scenario in which to throw the landing party. Fascinating (in Vulcan the word is ""sem-rik"".) And speaking of Vulcan---I was thoroughly intrigued by the triple mind-meld, which was actually a beautiful demonstration of one of Spock's unusual and little-known abilities: telepathic hypnosis. I noticed that he worded his spoken suggestions differently for each member of the rest of the command crew---each one a bit different, but the end result was the same: the idea that the bullets were unreal, they did not exist. The only thing damaged in the shootout was the wooden fence! As for the question of whether the review contained any spoilers, I would have to say "" no"". Something to think about.",10

A great episode where Spock Kirk, Chekov, and McCoy get stranding on a plant with a reenactment of O K Corral with incoming doom as the Star Trek gang must face Doc, Holliday and the gang.

7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spectre of the Gun (TV Episode 1968)",It's got some redeeming qualities.,"It seems like a lot of people pan this episode for its bare bones approach in terms of production values. To me that's part of its charm. It's looks like an offbeat play that's character focused, with the threads of a story to tie it together.There's an existential quality to this episode that, for me at least, brings out an ethereal plane for Kirk and crew. It's surreal. It's a puzzle within an enigma that pits the mettle of the bridge crew against an alien race that is trying to evaluate Star Fleet's finest.I have to admit, the whole Western thing seems pretty cliché, particularly for the time when this show was being made. Westerns were all the rage in the 50s and 60s, and I suppose Star Trek had to pay homage to the genre in some form or fashion. ""Spectre of the Gun"" offers that, just as other episodes touched on medical and courtroom drama formulas.Another positive about this episode is that the creative team really had to be inventive to make this Alien Western feel both Alien and Western. The cinematography is yet again a little more daring and inventive than in the previous two seasons. Shatner is challenged to carry this episode with his thesping, as he was called upon quite a few times for the third season.In my personal opinion this episode might have really shined had the whole Western thing been dropped, and replaced with some strange alien culture. But, as others have mentioned, the Western theme was brought in to save dollars.In spite of the low budget feel of this episode, I still find it intriguing in much the same lines as ""The Empath"", which as I pointed out was more of a theatre exercise where the camera was more focused on the actors than the actual story.Take it for what it's worth. It's a little more dramatically inventive if somewhat on the cheap side. Give it a shot.",
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spectre of the Gun (TV Episode 1968)",Star Trek: The Original Series - Spectre of the Gun,"Malkotian buoy in space warns the Enterprise not to ""encroach their area in space"" but Kirk is not persuaded away, believing it is important for the Federation to negotiate relations with them. The Malkotian warning was telepathically related to each member of the Enterprise crew in their own native language. Spock sees this as perhaps a sign to turn around and leave, but Kirk remains determined, beaming an away team to the Malkotian planet. A being of that species tells Kirk, Spock, Bones, Checkov, and Scotty they are to be punished for their ""disobedience"", recreating a frontier town with only a few buildings on some fake ground representing Tombstone. ""The violence of your ancestors will be the pattern of our death"" is Spock's reasoning behind the town created from Kirk's mind, seeing the history of 1880 as a proper ""send off"" for the away team. The gunfight at the OK Corral is what is produced and Kirk and company are the Clantons, to be on the receiving end of defeat at the pistols of Wyatt Earp and Spock mentioning the ""fast draw"" to Kirk, trying to dissuade him from any false moves, and Chekov getting the girl instead of the captain are just two peachy moments among so many in this episode which is great fun. It brings the western to Star Trek, even if Tombstone is an alien interpretation in sparse design. Spock and his precise knowledge of Earth history is put to good use, with Kirk needing his insight and wisdom during what is quite a unique situation.""We overcame out instinct for violence"" says Kirk. I would like to believe Roddenberry's feelings of this weren't totally without merit. But mankind loves to kill. I always thought it was cool when the show would kill one of the main characters then find a clever way to resurrect them. Chekov shot in cold-blood by a manufactured version of Morgan Earp, only for Spock's wisdom to offer a hope that he could be returned if Kirk, Scotty, and Bones realize that what was produced by the Malkotians resulted from a presentation that is unreal, only real when the senses of human mind accept what is seen as so. The gunfight itself, forced upon Kirk and company despite their attempts to avoid it (Kirk goes to the sheriff who is weak and unwilling to offer assistance, a tranquilizer built by Bones and Spock should work but doesn't on Scotty), is neat in that Spock's Vulcan mind meld might just help prevent any more ""death"". Kirk trying to talk the Earps out of the fight and Bones' encounter with Doc Holliday in the barber shop, both failing because of the bad blood between them (as evidenced from the history the Malkotians visualize on the planet), are compelling due to how the non-violent attempts don't work. Kirk and company try multiple ways to avoid the gunfight but are undermined by the Malkotians at every turn. I loved how the non-violent stance concludes to the end, with Kirk admitting to Spock he wanted to kill but fought against that, encouraging diplomatic relations with the Malkotians, proving that there is a chance for mankind after all. The visual of a western town on an alien world, with the officers in their uniforms opposite gunfighters and such from Tombstone transplanted to this place makes for quite a memorable sight. Lost in Space would do this without proper scientific credence resulting in camp, but Star Trek does so imaginatively.",8
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spectre of the Gun (TV Episode 1968)",Third season,"I don't understand the 3rd season criticism. I read a review of this episode the other day that called it ""corny"", ""goofy"", etc... Have these people ever seen the rest of the series? How is this episode cornier than ""The Omega Glory"", or ""The Apple""? Every complaint about this episode I've seen can easily be said about any 1st or 2nd season episode. (Kinda sounds like Star Wars prequel hate to me.) I think the third season is actually better in places than the first two seasons. For one thing, the music is much better, a lot more subtle. The slow pace people complain about is actually a good thing because it allows for more character development as well as simply slowing down and presenting the environment a little bit. Yes, the episodes are corny, but THIS IS STAR TREK!!! That's par for the course here, friends.I like the feel and look of this episode. Sure, the Sylvia character isn't really needed but one could easily say that about many Star Trek characters. I like this episode a lot better than the movie Tombstone. That's for sure.",9
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spectre of the Gun (TV Episode 1968)",I Always Enjoyed This One,"I think what has stayed with me all these years are the cold fish-eyes of the Earps and Doc Holliday. Normally portrayed as heroes, these black clad, cold blooded killers face off against the Enterprise principles. A planetary people, the Melcotians, are angry with Kirk and the gang for crossing into their territory. He proceeds anyway because of his basic bullheadedness. The crew find themselves in Tombstone, Arizona, on the day of the Gunfight at the OK Corral. They are recognized as the Clantons and their ilk (normally the bad guys in the story). I always get a kick out of guys like Chekov (and even Kirk in some episodes) when, in the most dire circumstances, they are taken in by their human weaknesses. Chekov gets himself killed because he can't wait three hours (make that five minutes) to hook up with a saloon girl, ticking off Virgil Earp, who has desires for her. Their lives are at stake; what is he doing? What is weird is the Enterprise crew continues to wear their regular uniforms, yet the townspeople and the Earps see things differently. They have old western gun belts, but the rest of their attire is their day-to-day clothing. Why didn't the Melcotians go the extra step? All that aside, it is a pretty entertaining episode.",8

They meet an alien face that tells them they trespassed and passed a sentence on them - to a replica of the 1881 gunfight of the O.K. Corral. It is October 26, 1881 it is the fight of Clanton gang and the Earps. The Earps won and the Clanton's lost - the crew is in the role of the Clanton's and history cannot be changed. Now they have to find a way out of there.Neat episode, some cute scenes, some gun-slinging and it's a bit different. A great episode? No. A fun episode? Yes. One thing bothers me, in the beginning of the episode Kirk kept calling Spock ""Science Officer"" instead of his usually friendly way of saying Spock or Mr. Spock. That is a minor thing but it really bothers me. 8.5/10",8
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spectre of the Gun (TV Episode 1968)",Kirk vs the nasty ole Earps,"Well this one was a doozie, not necessarily bad but definitely needs more than one view. Why? Cause it's fun! There's no philosophical quandary that's being disputed here it's just a bunch of technobabble being used to justify watching Kirk and co. as Cowboys, and I might have a weak spot for westerns but I happened to enjoy this one.The episode goes as follows..Kirk and his ole starship posse are on their way to initiate diplomatic talks with the Melkot a species that has thus far isolated itself from the federation. On the way however Kirk runs into a melkotian warning buoy threatening any ships that cross into melkotian space, Kirk having learned nothing from the corbomite maneuver destroys the buoy and approaches the melkotian planet. Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty and Chekov beam down to the planet only to find it eerily similar to 19th century Earth, particularly the O.K. Corral. The melkotians inform the landing party that as they have crossed into their space they will now be killed by being forced to take the place of the Clanton gang in the shootout at the O.K. Corral (don't know why they didn't just blow them up but hey, you be you). Kirk explains to them that the clantons lot the shootout and most of them died, and as they all believe the event is about to be re-enacted the gang realizes they have to avoid the shootout. So basically Kirk and the posse get acclimated to the situation and meet the nasty ole Earps, the Earps don't like Kirk and the posse as they believe them to be the Clantons. Meanwhile Chekov meets billy Claiborne's girlfriend and becomes quickly enamored with her, and as Kirk goes to all lengths to convince other people that the landing party aren't the clantons, Chekov gets into a confrontation with one of the Earps and gets shot and pronounced dead by McCoy. So the crew is sad about Chekov for like five minutes until they realize that Chekov was Billy Claiborne and Billy Claiborne didn't die in the actual gunfight, this means that they are not destined to repeat the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Knowing that they can't outgun the Earps, Kirk and the posse come up with the idea of knockout gas and so they spend a good amount of time preparing the gas. Once it's ready they realize the gas doesn't work, so the posse decides on just not going to the gunfight and are immediately teleported there (insert rimshot here, great comedic timing amiright). Right before the gunfight Spock deduces that Chekov only died because he believed the bullets would kill him, if they believe with all certainty that the bullets can't harm them they will not be harmed. McCoy says there will always be a shred of doubt and so Spock does a mind meld with all of them (I mean I like the mind meld as much as the next guy but it's becoming a Deus ex machine kinda thing, know when to stop a good thing guys). The gunfight starts and no one gets killed no matter how many times they get shot and so they knock out the Earps and right before killing them decide not to. Kirk and co. are then seen back on the ship with Chekov alive and well, Spock tells them that Chekov only thought the girl was real not the bullets so he didn't die (some bottom of the barrel cheesy writing here but hey whatever), the melkotian contact Kirk and say how they're surprised Kirk didn't kill the Earps, and because of this agree to open relations with the federation, so Kirk being a reckless rebel succeeds at defying the buoy yet again.The episode was entertaining to me, but hey I have a soft spot for westerns so judge for yourself. I enjoyed the whole question of whether things only affect because you believe in their effect, it was very matrixey and I love the matrix. Acting was all pretty good I enjoyed the menacing stares of the Earps and the latex back western folk, nothing particularly meaningful philosophically in this one but it was a fun episode of Star Trek and I'm all for fun Star Trek when done properly, unlike other previous poor iterations (cough Spock's Brain cough).Cowboy Kirk and the nasty ole Earps",8

Kirk decides to ignore the warning and continue to the Melkotians' home planet. When they beam down they are surprised to find a foggy, featureless world, nothing like reports. Before long a being appears before them and tells them they have been sentenced to death and the means of the death will based on Kirk's cultural memories in the Wild West town of Tombstone! The town they find themselves in is rather strange; the buildings are just frontages, their phasers have become revolvers and the locals believe that the landing party, Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty and Chekov, are actually the Clanton Gang. To make matters worse it is the day of the famous Gunfight at the OK Corral where the real Clantons were gunned down. They struggle to find a way to change fate but as Spock observes 'history can't be changed' but perhaps it can; Chekov, who is playing the part of Billy Claiborne is gunned down in a fight over a woman but the real Billy Claiborne was the sole survivor from the Clanton Gang. It becomes apparent that normal rules don't apply here; if they believe they won't die then maybe they won't. As the allotted time approaches they will find out.I found this classic episode to be rather fun although I can see why some viewers won't enjoy it. The way the buildings are only frontages was obviously a way of keeping the costs down but it also served to emphasise that the place wasn't what it seemed. The story had plenty of drama as well as some amusing moments; I couldn't help but be amused at how Chekov was quickly enchanted by a beautiful woman despite the danger they were all in. There is a nice sense of impending doom and those playing the Earp Brothers and Doc Holliday are suitably menacing. Once the final confrontation is over we do get a bit of a cop-out ending as we learn Chekov is not dead after all not that that was much of a surprise it was never a series to kill off major characters. Overall though I found this to be an enjoyable episode.",8

Yes, it's another time travel plot, but the cheap Western set they had to use due to the low budget actually added credence to the eerie scene. Captain Kirk, Mr Spock, Doctor McCoy, Scotty and Checkov beam down to the planet surface after crossing a space buoy. The aliens are not amused, and they doom our space heroes to the losing side of a famous gun showdown from the Old West. It is strange, however, that the planet's inhabitants do not notice the Starfleet uniforms or Mr Spock's unusual appearance. Mr Checkov gets into a dispute over a woman and is shot, apparently dead. The remaining crew attempts desperately to find a way out of their certain demise in just a few hours, when various incongruities convince the Science Officer that the set-up is all an illusion. In order to save their lives, he uses the mind meld technique to convince the others that the guns are not real. The technique works and soon they are back on the Enterprise where Mr Checkov is indeed alive.The episode highlights the power of our belief systems. Believing something makes it true for you, whether or not there is an objective reality involved. Quite a powerful episode for that reason, and one of the top 10 in my opinion.",9
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spectre of the Gun (TV Episode 1968)",Matrix Trek,"Spectre of the Gun, the first episode in production order for the third year, would have been one heck of an interesting way to begin the final season of the original ""Star Trek"". Most of the episode is set in a bare-bones Old West town--a mock Tombstone, Arizona, with Captain Kirk and crew having to play the Clanton Boys to what seems to be the Earps and Doc Holliday.The Enterprise ends up in its OK Corral pickle by trying to make contact with the Melkotians, an isolationist alien race that look like giant Pez dispensers enshrouded in fog. The Melkotians want to remain isolated for reasons we discover by the end of the episode (in a great, ""Oops! Okay then"" moment), and when Kirk doesn't heed their warnings, the core exploratory crew end up imprisoned in Tombstone, waiting to meet their terminal fate. To themselves, and us, Kirk and the boys still look like their 1960s depiction of a space crew in high-waters, go-go boots and velure. To whatever else it is that populates Tombstone, they appear to be the Clanton Gang, and when they insist that they're not, the Tombstone residents take them to be attempting a typical Clanton Gang practical joke.Tombstone looks fake--it's obviously just an incomplete western set, maybe intended for a different television program or film, and it's obviously in a studio--just check out those shadows falling on the walls. That could be seen as a flaw or it could be seen as metaphorically reflecting the artificiality of Kirk and company's dilemma, as it turns out that they're actually stuck in a kind of Matrix-like pseudo-reality. They seem to be in Tombstone, and stuck within its city limits by some kind of force field, but they eventually figure out that it's just an illusion, and their bodies are more like brains-in-a-vat. It's a nice premise that gives a lot to feast on for fans of westerns, harder sci-fi (allusions are made to this in many ways, including the tranquilizer idea and that fact that Spock figures out the reality of their situation by the fact that it didn't work), and even philosophy--Spock gives a nice little speech about ontology and epistemology (what is reality and how do we know it), and again like the Matrix, the climax hinges on what's essentially a Zen-like approach to the world.",9

The theme for this as in other episodes is the aliens testing how humans react when placed in impossible situations.If your into the acting, this one has better acting than other episodes.

If the sight of Mr. Spock walking around in his normal Star Fleet uniform but with a six-gun holstered on a belt around his waist isn't goofy enough, don't worry, there's plenty else here to qualify. The plot has to do with Kirk and landing party arriving uninvited on an alien planet; the aliens take offense at this and decide to 'punish' the outsiders by forcing them to relive a part of Earth's past; specifically, the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. (Those aliens, what WILL they think of next?) The inevitable outcome is that Kirk and company will be killed. Much of the episode then revolves around the landing party trying to circumvent this inevitability in various ways- by leaving town, by staying put, by trying to talk the Earps out of killing them, and finally by trying to build a gas grenade to render their opponents unconscious. None of which works, and none of this portrays our heroes in a particularly courageous light. Kirk even visits the local sheriff and practically begs him to stop the fight. ""I can't kill them!"" Kirk screams histrionically, while the sheriff quite understandably looks at him like he's crazy. Spock finally comes up with the solution: he will mind-meld with each of the others and convince them the bullets are illusions and can't harm them. Hey, makes sense to me. Sure enough, the Earps (and Doc Holliday) show up, blasting away, and all that happens is that Kirk gets to kick one of their butts for no apparent good reason.

There, they find cardboard-like sets where they re-enact the famous and historically insignificant Gunfight at the OK Corral. While this topic has been beaten to death in many, many films, having an intergalactic crew go to the old West is amazingly dumb but original. However, given that this is Star Trek, you know it will all work out in the end. Frankly, everything about this episode stank from the writing, the acting to the sets. It was just awful and pointless and just an excuse to use some old props. You see, if this had all been done ""tongue in cheek"", it might have worked, but as a drama, I just found myself laughing too much to take it seriously.FYI--Many years later, when Star Trek the Next Generation was running low on ideas, they sent Worf to the old West again--a sure sign that the show is out of ideas or is ""jumping the shark"".",2

Every time a sci-fi show does a western, it falls flat and is a sign that the show has jumped the shark. When I see s sci-fi show doing a western plot, I think to myself ""The writers and actors must be really get bored with their genre and wished they worked in a different genre."" But this episode is worse than your average sci-fi-does-western schlock. The cardboard set is literally half-built and looks worse than the set of a high school stage production. The evil gunslingers are robotic. The crew knows that the whole setup is an illusion created by aliens, but they still play along and are terrified. The plot makes little sense. The crew survives the gunfight by literally doing nothing. How anti-climatic.

The ep gives the impression that Bill Claiborne (Chekov) was the only one who survived, so when he is killed before the gunfight that is what convinces them that history can be changed (as if it already weren't). So one result of this new admonition is that Kirk goes running to the sheriff to encourage organizing the town against the Earps and Holliday-- besides the E's & H and the sheriff, there had only been 3 others seen, none of whom would likely consider that-- Kirk was real bright, wasn't he? But then the 2 really intriguing plot turns take place. Since the tranquilizer made by Dr. McCoy does not work, when it ""has to work,"" Spock tells them the whole thing is an illusion-- well great, had they really thought the Melcossians could resurrect previously living human beings from surely many light years and centuries away? But the interesting part here is that Spock tells them the illusory bullets CAN kill them if they judge them to be real; but this is quickly converted to having ""not the slightest doubt"" that they are UNreal! So Spock melds their minds to his and so they are totally convinced the bullets (and the guns and their 4 enemies and the corral) are not real. So the 'bullets' pass right through them, then Kirk jumps Wyatt Earp, and is tempted to kill him with his (Earp's) own gun. Then they are back on the ship and Spock wants to question Kirk about ""wanting to kill."" Kirk admits he did want to kill. LOLOL... It was Spock who convinced them the 'Earps' are not real, and he hints of blame to Kirk for wanting to kill what doesn't exist to be killed? Where is *logic*?Finally (though this was before the Spock/Kirk exchange) Chekov is alive and back with them and Dr. McCoy says he is in perfect health. But he can only remember the girl who came on to him (as Bill Claiborne). Kirk says that may explain it (why he's not dead)-- the only thing real to him was the girl. Well, if the bullets were NOT real, by that explanation, then how did they ""kill"" him, even for just a while? It would seem to be a 'both or neither dilemma'-- both the beautiful girl and the deadly bullet were real, and he acted according to this perception, or else neither of them were real, so he wouldn't have 'died.'",
21,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spectre of the Gun (TV Episode 1968)",Embarrassingly Bad,"This episode is so bad it's not even campy. I just love how Kirk knows everything about the history of the OK Corral, even though it's been established in the past that he's an American history buff. Spock says 'the past cannot be changed' - really? He must have forgotten about ""The City on the Edge of Forever."" Useless character Sylvia makes for more boring dialogue. She's totally unbelievable. Then we have Wyatt Earp who looks disturbingly like pornstar John Holmes. And is that a couple of beers on the table when Chekov gets shot and we cut to the saloon? Somehow I can't see Spock enjoying a brewski. I could go on and on about the inconsistencies in this travesty. I've heard TOS fans call this the 'turd season' and that's a true assessment. I actually love TOS, which is why this stinker annoys me so much.",1

The Melkotians want nothing to do with violent alien humans and ""sentence"" them all to death for violating the Melkotian's ""no trespassing"" zone. So, the ""Fab 4"" (Scotty, Checkov, Spock and Kirk) beam down without a clue about what is about to happen. As usual, Kirk is in touch with his ""inner John Wayne"", so this manner of execution is chosen by the aliens, after reading his mind. Everyone is to die at 5 P.M (Western time) at the O.K. Corral, in 1881. Spock convinces them with a ""Vulcan mind-meld"" that it's all just an illusion, so no one needs to die, except maybe of laughter, while filming this clunker. Our Russian ""Davy Jones"" gets some serious ""lip lock"" from the slutty dance hall girl. Like a bad broken ""Holodeck Next Generation"" story, only worse. Had I produced this one, I would have at least made it more fun and used one of the old wild west backlots in Hollywood, not ""cardboard"" sets from ""Blazing Saddles"". The gunfighters would have been 1940's cowboy stars. Alas, another recycled plot from Season One. There, the ""Green Lizard Guy"" was the antagonist. Another example of why there was no season four.",5
23,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Spectre of the Gun (TV Episode 1968)","Good story, but the ending is a cop-out","I really liked this one, and consider it one of the best episodes of season 3. the drams builds nicely throughout, but then comes crashing down, in an ending that defies logic and makes no sense.Checkov, who the town's people see as ""Billy Claiborne"" is killed by a bullet. McCoy confirms the fact that he's dead. When the landing party next must engage in the shootout with the Earps and Doc Holliday, it is pointed out by McCoy that the slightest doubts about the bullets not being real (Spock has the ability to do this as a Vulcan)would be enough to render the bullets real and kill them. Spock engages them in a Vulcan mind meld to remove any doubts about the bullets being fake. It works, as the bullets pass through them. They are not killed, and are returned to the ship, where we see Checkov sitting on a table being examined by McCoy. Where exactly was Checkov from the time he was killed till he reappears on the ship? Checkov was not with the landing party when they returned to the ship, so how did this ""dead man"" get back aboard? Maybe he wasn't really dead, but then why did McCOY confirm that he WAS dead? Checkov, not receiving the Vulcan mind meld from Spock, no doubt believed the bullets could kill him, so when he was shot, he died. But then,back aboard the ship, Kirk implies that Checkov did not believe the bullets were real, so he survived. But if that was the case, the bullets should have passed right through him as they did with the others at the shoot out,yet we see him get shot and die. The easy answer here is that Checkov, as a major character, was not expendable (like the red-shirts) and so the writers needed a way to bring him back, even if it made no sense. the writers wanted it both ways...to have the drama of Checkov being killed, but also have a convenient way of bringing him back. Unfortunately, this led to a huge collapse in logic and made what should have been one of the best Trek episodes into one that was rather ordinary",

To be fair here this was a race that had great power of illusions and set this all as a trap for the cast members and crew of the USS Enterprise.The Melkotians whom we get a glimpse of and who Abraham Sofaer gives voice to have had a strict isolationist policy having ventured forth into the universe and not liking what they see. So when the Enterprise comes calling on a diplomatic mission like Commodore Perry was in Japan the aliens take their weapons, give them old Colt 45 six guns and set them down in a replica of Tombstone, Arizona where everyone calls, Kirk, Spock, Chekhov,Scotty, and McCoy the names of the participants in the famous gunfight with the Earp family.Sad to say that Blazing Saddles came around a half dozen years later and seeing the 'Tombstone set' I was reminded of the fake town that Cleavon Little had the townspeople of Red Rock make. It does take away from the serious aspect of the episode, but not exactly Gene Roddenberry's fault.Of course they pass the Melkotian test, but as to how, let's say that Leonard Nimoy's abilities as a Vulcan come in mighty handy here.",5
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Day of the Dove (TV Episode 1968)",The Kang War - Stardate: Armageddon,"One thing about the original Trek series - it had its share of great titles, this one included. It's probably my personal favorite of the episodes from the 3rd season: it's an obvious action episode and doesn't let up for its entire length. This also contains the best Klingon interpretation on the original series, courtesy of actor Ansara. I recall reading somewhere a long time ago that Ansara wasn't the first choice for the part; well, after he got it, he just tore into it with a fearful vengeance. If the original Trek series had continued into a 4th and 5th season, this would have been the Klingon to bring back for another confrontation with Kirk and the crew. Only the Khan character from ""Space Seed"" presented a superior antagonist for our Starfleet heroes. Kang just oozes that tough leathery Klingon orneriness which set a new standard for how the race was portrayed (he was also one of the Klingons brought back during the later series, on DS9). He really commands our attention here with a truly charismatic portrayal by Ansara. This episode also delivers a few memorable scenes of our heroic Enterprise officers behaving in atypical fashion, recalling a few other episodes where they were subverted mentally somehow. In this case, it involved reversion to basic primal instincts such as race hatred and bloodthirst, allowing actors Kelley, Doohan, Koenig and even the usually placid Nimoy to tap into their inner rage. The intense quarrel between Spock and Scotty is especially startling.The plot seems very simple, yet is deceptively brilliant: group two sets of warring factions (Starfleet & Klingons) into equal numbers of 38 each on a ship such as the Enterprise, remove all advanced weapons and arm each side with swords; then set them at each others throats. Then sit back and watch. One can envision an entire season of such a story, an endless tale of conflict on a drifting starship out in space. It's an early version of video games that wouldn't come about until over a decade later. Of course, this is a bit more sophisticated, a commentary on the nature of war and bigotry. It's very easy to hate such beings as the Klingons for most of us, especially in view of the way they were depicted on the original series, including in this episode. They come across as, at best, belligerent and vicious, in contrast to the more civilized Starfleet crew. But, as the episode progresses, we begin to see less and less differences, until, by the end, we also begin to wonder what these guys are fighting about; they're two sides of the same coin with minor idealogical differences, as mentioned way back in ""Errand of Mercy."" It's interesting to hear Kang's wife speak of the Federation's death camps and realize we'd heard pretty much the same thing about Klingons in this and earlier episodes. It's an exciting entry for the 3rd season, with excellent pacing, superb editing (Scotty thrusts with a sword and it cuts to the ship zooming towards us) and loads of tension. The ending is a bit too syrupy for my taste, but I still get a kick out of Kang's last shot at Kirk. Klingons just can't resist some of the baser things in life.",8
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Day of the Dove (TV Episode 1968)",outstanding season 3 Star Trek show with a moral plot,"I just viewed the show today and it is one of the best conceived and executed Star Trek plots by Jerome Bixby, the only science fiction writer to remain with the series from season 2 through to season 3 of TOS. 38 Federation vs 38 Kilngon crew are driven to fight in perpetuity under the control of an alien being. One encounters many bizarre and unreal scenes: for instance, Chekov believes that the Klingons killed his older brother Piotr and wants to avenge Piotr's death. However, in reality, Chekov was an only child, as Sulu observes. Scotty and McCoy are both filled with feelings of burning hate, resentment and racism towards the Klingons for attacking the Enterprise crew when they would normally be trying to reason with Kang and reach a truce with their unwanted Klingon guests. Bixby aptly demonstrates how the alien entity was already influencing and controlling people's thoughts and emotions early in the episode.I completely second Bogmeister's comments. This was one of the top 5 episodes of season 3 and I rate it at a generous 9 out of 10 for execution and believability. Bogmeister strikes the right tone with his post's title: ""Stardate Armageddon."" That memorable line stuck in my head too as Kirk notes he has to engineer a truce with Kang within 10 minutes and cease all hostilities between his crewmen and the Klingons before the Enterprise's dilitium crystals are fully depleted and the ship is rendered completely powerless--and placed permanently under the alien's sway. Both Kirk and Spock recognise the true enemy is the alien which feeds on feelings of mutual hate and conflict, rather than the Klingons who have seized control of parts of his ship. The part about intraship beaming was a novel method for Kirk to quickly reach Kang and arrange a mutual truce to weaken and expel the entity. Michael Ansara's Kang was superbly cast in his role as the Klingon commander who has no qualms about torturing Chekov or shutting off life systems in those sections of the Enterprise which the Federation crew still control. Bixby also gives an important role to Mara, Kang's wife and one of the only Klingon women ever depicted in TOS, as the peacemaker of the show who ultimately convinces Kang to reach a truce with Kirk. If all the season 3 scripts were written this well, Star Trek's final season might have produced more hits rather than duds instead. Anyhow, 'Day of the Dove' was a shining gem in the series' troubled final season. As a moral play concerning the destructive power of racism and hatred, it ranks among the classic Star Trek shows which we come to expect--and is infinitely superior to the ponderous and heavy handed 'Let That be your Last Battlefield.'",9
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Day of the Dove (TV Episode 1968)","Before ""Twin Peaks""...","There was Star Trek. This episode is actually the reworking of the same theme taken from the ""Wolf in the Fold"" episode, but blown up on an international scale, so to speak.I say ""Twin Peaks"" because, if memory serves from what my TV Screen writing Instrustor recited some 20 years ago, the detective in that show makes a comment to the effect of ""Can you really believe that a father would murder his own daughter?"" ... or words to that effect. Trek was ahead of the curve, yet again, with ""Day of the Dove"" postulating a possible explanation for all the violence we witness in the news.Are humans really capable of bloodshed on an industrial scale? Can mankind be so fraught with flaws that he must always reach for the sword to settle otherwise mundane differences? Can this really be the case? Or is there something else at work here? All the racial prejudice, social hatreds, and lusts sparked from aggression, are they really all within us? Regardless of the science fiction in this science fiction piece, the story itself, after examining all the horrible manifestations of man's baser nature, comes to a conclusion of how to settle differences, and presents it to us with some outstanding thesping by the usual suspects, including Michael Ansara playing the epitome of Klingon commanders.In the days when this remarkable TV show was on the wane, the hard core of fandom was given a treat in the form of this episode. Filled with action, intrigue, a dash of horror and mystery, along with a good deal of fret by both sides of the coin, this episode brings the awful truth of wartime drama to the audience.Fortunately it is a Star Trek episode, and we are thus treated to the heroics of Captain James T. Kirk who, once again, risks all and holds the honor and inner humanity (Klingonity?) of the opposition in high regard. Kirk and Kang show us the way. The final shot is not just part of the plot and story, but also a very symbolic gesture.Definitely worth watching.Enjoy.",

Anything can set it off and in this episode some thing nearly does.Some of the Star Trek regulars are trapped in a section of the Enterprise that has been sealed off. Futuristic weapons have been taken away and our regulars have been given swords. That puts them at a disadvantage with the warrior society the Klingons have since they prize skill in hand to hand type combat. Still our guys hold their own.It soon becomes apparent that something is creating this competition and is feeding off the energy of hate that is created by the humans and Klingons. There's an old expression that feuds themselves take on a life of their own and sometimes it's forgotten why they start. This episode gives credence to that idea.Michael Ansara plays the leader of the Klingons and he's well suited to the part of Kang. Ansara repeated his role in future Star Trek shows. He and William Shatner have to realize there's a common enemy out there.It's an interesting allegory and can be applied to the state of this world's politics then and now.",8

Kirk discovers the alien, and must find a way to convince the Klingons not to play the alien's game. But the ship's power is draining, and once the power is gone the two groups will be locked together forever in futile combat.This is an excellent episode with a good, steady pace, logical plot developments, great characters, and a collection of superb performances. At the top of the performance list is Michael Ansara as the Klingon leader Kang: he's charismatic, ferocious, and honorable in his own brutal way, a great match for Kirk. The actors playing Scotty, McCoy, and Chekhov all put in great work showing the usually-reasonable Enterprise men being infected with induced hate and rage. It's also fun to see Sulu get in on the action a little.It is always good to have a firm plot as the foundation for everything, and this episode has it. The stakes are established immediately, the limited options make the tension increase steadily, and the final resolution is satisfying and shows us, once again, Kirk at his best.It falls just short of a ten for a few minor mistakes here and there, and the fact the final dissolve was so sudden: I'dve liked to see how Kang and Kirk finally say farewell.Many people malign season three, but it did give us a pretty fair number of good episodes: Day of the Dove stands as the very best of the third year.",9

It is an anti-violence, pacifistic story concerning this multicolored blob of light (imagine a spinning small cloud that goes red when violence and hatred are at their peak) which wails as tempers, racial tensions, and warlike desires rise and rage. A planet is where the Enterprise and a Klingon cruiser find themselves, both believing the other attacked their people. The war- hungry entity disables the cruiser, causing it to be a radioactive danger needing to be obliterated. On the planet Kang (Michael Ansara) and his accompaniment of soldiers besiege Kirk, Chekov, and Bones, attempting to beam about the Enterprise for takeover. Kirk coordinates a trick where just his three are beamed aboard while the Klingons are in midspace. Soon the Klingons are held in a room while Kirk and crew battle the ensuing influence of the entity, filling them with racism, prejudice, faux patriotism, hate, and warlike mentality. It will take securing their humanity, shooing away their burgeoning feelings which are encouraged by the entity's influence, and together defy the urge to initiate violence. Kang taking control of Engineering, the entity manifesting daggers for Klingons and Enterprise crew to engage in combat, Chekov influenced to believe the Klingons killed a brother that doesn't exist, Kang's wife (Susan Howard) actually joining forces with Kirk to try and convince Kang of the entity's influence, and Scotty and McCoy going warhog are highlights. Scotty calling Spock a freak, and Spock suffering the distaste of racial hatred show just how strong the entity can influence its victims. Good seeing a cat and mouse between the Enterprise, Klingons, *and* the entity. Laughter and good will, even if faked to undermine the entity, between the Klingons and Enterprise, with Kirk the peacekeeper realizing that infinite fighting until the dilithium crystals run their course as the entity takes them out of the galaxy, is a lark!",7

He's front and center here in the battle against the Klingons before Captain Kirk figures out something isn't quite right. Does Chekov have a brother or not? Or is an alien presence aboard the Enterprise causing everyone's mind to slip just a little bit.This was the second time that Kirk found it necessary to take sides with the Klingons against a common enemy. It happened way back in the first season in #1.26 - Errand of Mercy, but this time the Captain had to go through a female Science Officer (Susan Howard) and wife of the Klingon commander Kang (Michael Ansara). True to his martial nature, Kang was willing to sacrifice his wife if that's what it took to defeat the Federation. Calling Kirk's bluff was a bold move, but at the same time, convinced Mara that the Captain was on the level in seeking a solution to the alien presence aboard the Enterprise.I'll second the other reviewers on this board for their approval of Ansara's choice as the Klingon commander. He brought a steely resolve to the role, not unlike a lot of the characters he portrayed in TV Westerns of the era, particularly that of the Apache Cochise in the late 1950's series 'Broken Arrow'. In fact, Ansara portrayed Indians and non-white foreign characters a lot during his career, so playing Kang looked like a natural for him. Good job.Whenever it happened, it was cool to see the main players break character to go against the grain like they did here. McCoy and Scotty go just a little berserk, and even Spock has a tough time controlling his human half. However I always have to wonder why Captain Kirk manages to stay above the fray when push comes to shove.

Kirk, McCoy, Chekhov and a red shirt security member beam down to the planet to find no traces of the colony. The nearby Klingons received a distress call from the Enterprise and their vessel was fired upon leaving many Klingons dead. The Klingons beamed down and confront Kirk and crew about what happened. The Klingons and the Federation have been a peace for 3 years but the Klingon Kang believes that Kirk's ship fired on them to provoke a war. What none of the see is the alien watching them. Chekhov gets upset over remembering his bother Peter and others dying from Klingons years back and the Klingons detain him, but their guns on Kirk and orders Kirk to beam them all aboard.

An alien with intelligence and it's own reasoning for doing these things to both sides. Minds are being taken over by the alien, blame is being thrown back and forth, revenge (Klingons), including false revenge (Chekhov), life support being cut off, insults flying, race hatred and more.

Much of the acting is unfortunately poor and over-the-top such that it dilutes the drama and the engaging plot. The ending is overly simplistic and pacifistic.

There is considerable byplay between these classic adversaries, accusations flying, misunderstandings about history and basic facts. To make a long story short, they aren't much different than warring countries today (the US certainly being one of them). One must wade through so much distrust that getting to some kind of peaceful situation is about impossible. There are weird things that are memorable here. One is Chekov ranting and raving about Klingons having killed his brother (he is an only child). Another is Kirk and Kang having to pretend to be friends with a common goal.

Despite the one very glowing review so far, it must be hard for readers to know what to make of the show since they only two reviews are polar opposites. Read on and decide for yourself.The Enterprise respond to a distress call which turns out to be a trap by some Klingons. Through some odd coincidences that few seem to question, many Klingons are beamed aboard the Enterprise and an all-out war erupts--complete with swords and other ancient weapons. All the phasers magically have disappeared and the decks have been sealed off sort of like an arena. And, when people die, they magically heal themselves and fight on and on and on--all to the delight of a spinning ball of light that looks like it was created by spinning a prism. Eventually, Kirk is able to get himself out of his battle frenzy that was imposed by the spinning ball and convinces everyone to just be pals and laugh the problem away--at which point, brotherhood and the chorus of KUMBAYA drive away the evil force and all is back to normal (okay, the ""Kumbaya"" thing didn't happen--but it was almost THAT bad!). I feel myself gagging as I type--yecch what a preachy and stupid episode. It sure could have been better if they had kept the plot but given it some decent resolution that wasn't so cloying as well as better special effects to represent the creature.

12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Day of the Dove (TV Episode 1968)","War, what is it good for, according to Kirk says nothing","A fine episode of Star Trek, and in my opinion the best that season 3 has to offer. It's classic 60s Star Trek in almost every way, a fearsome foe, terribly obvious props, flashing light based aliens and a cliche on the nose social message that everyone can relate to, all it's missing is Kirk hooking up with some alien girl and a little more overacting from kirk (I know, I dream too big). It's classic trek and you have to love it, a strong plot and a meaningful message on how mindless soldiers can be and how they fight the battles of others, people in the shadows who get stronger and more powerful through war, a great commentary all together on the uselessness of war and how military leaders strive and grow through it a message Roddenberry clearly believed in.The episode goes as follows..Kirk and the enterprise respond to a distress call on a planet claiming to be attacked by an unidentified ship, there they find the klingons apparently responding to the same, but before space battle can ensue the Klingon ship is disabled without the enterprise even firing (disabled them without firing a single shot, Kirk you've outdone yourself). A party of Klingons beams down claiming the enterprise attached them and they knock down Kirk and the landing party and claim command of the enterprise. The Klingon commander, Kang, is a fierce and honorable leader like worf but before that. Kang argues with Kirk about who attacked who and then holds Kirk and his party hostage demanding he beam them up. Kirk sends Spock a signal before they're beamed up and so Spock beams the landing party up and keeps the Klingons de materialized until a security team gets there ready to subdue them. Kirk imprisons the kilngon party and the remaining crew on the ship which is around 100 men. Spock informs Kirk that the Klingons were too far to attack the colony but Kirk dismissed this, after a while of Klingon plotting and waiting to take the ship, the enterprise crew loses control of the ship which starts warping in its own random course, and at the same time a large portion of the crew becomes trapped on an isolated area of the ship leaving the enterprise with around 100 men as well.. Kirk assumes the Klingons did this and as he confronts them swords start appearing and all the phasers turn to swords as well and a massive fight begins. Kirk and his men escape but the Klingons now have weapons and can take over the ship. So while Scotty tries to free the trapped crew Kirk tries to figure out what happened, he decides they need to take engineering, while Kirk is giving orders Chekov gets up and demands he go along because Klingons killed his brother piotr. Kirk says no but Chekov goes anyways (always the rebel that poorly history educated Russian), sulu confused explains Chekov doesn't have a brother leaving Kirk to wonder what's happening. Meanwhile Kang and the Klingons launch an attacking and take over engineering, Kirks crew seems agitated and aggressive towards the Klingons more so than they should including McCoy calling them butchers and demanding revenge and Scotty defying orders. Spock detects an alien presence on board and surmises it alone is responsible for the strange happenings, however before they can do something about it Kang tells Kirk he's taken control of engineering and will disconnect the life support of all areas Klingons don't control. So while the gang slowly dies sulu goes off to try and repair life support while Scotty and Spock fight (my money's on Spock in that one, I hear he packs a mean pinch). Suddenly life support is restored and sulu has nothing to do with it, Lang's wife Mars informs Kang and he sends her to go try to fix their course or something and on her way she gets captured and nearly raped by Chekov before Kirk knocks some sense into him (quite literally). Kirk realizes that the alien is keeping them alive because it thrives on violence, and that the war will literally never stop as the alien will keep them alive to fight an endless war only for it to grow stronger. Kirk tries to convince Mara of this but she doesn't buy it so Kirk calls Kang and tries to convince him, and when that doesn't work he threatens to kill Mara which Kang dismisses and Kirk obviously backs down (not so good at poker now is he). However once Kirk doesn't kill Mara she suddenly realizes that the federation isn't evil and decides to believe in the alien and agrees to go with Kirk to convince Kang. Kirk decides to dangerously transport himself in his own ship to where Kang is and once successful he confronts Kang. Kang still in the aliens influence attacks Kirk and they begin an awesome sword fight, meanwhile Spock arrives with more men and begins battling Klingons. Suddenly Kirk surrenders saying it would be pointless as the alien would only revive him and keep the war going. Kirk shows Kang the alien feeding on their hate and kang decides to see reason because Klingons fight their own battles and honor and qapla and só on. Kirk and kang call a ceasefire to the troops which weakens the alien and then start laughing at the alien which defeats it once and for all, and all is right in the world again.All in all it was an extremely strong episode. As mentioned before it had a good message that was transmitted well, all the key points of a trek classic, and some pretty good acting with special mention to the actor who played he was fantastic. It was an honestly suspenseful episode with two strong villains and a strong plot that strung together made a trek classic that could be rewatched all day long. In fact the message is still relevant today and that makes it even stronger an episode than before, this episode was music to my ears and if you'll excuse me, I have some Bruce Springsteen I have to go listen to.",10
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Day of the Dove (TV Episode 1968)",Feeding on hatred,"The Enterprise responds to a distress call from a colony but finds no sign of them; it is as if there were no colony. Shortly afterwards a Klingon vessel arrives and suffers damage without the Enterprise firing a shot. A Klingon landing party, led by Kang, confronts Kirk on the planet and blames him for the attack on his ship while Kirk accuses him of wiping out the colony. Kang intends to take the Enterprise by forcing Kirk to beam them up; his plans fail and he is the one captured. Things don't stay that way for long though, a strange entity appears to be playing one side against the other. It turns the crew's phasers into swords and similarly arms the Klingons; fights ensue but injuries soon heal no matter how serious and the hatred is magnified as each side's distrust grows. If they are to avoid an eternity of fighting they will have to come to an understanding; something that won't be easy.This is a solid episode with an interesting central concept; a being that feeds on violent, negative emotion. This nicely brings the crew of the Enterprise back into conflict with their most famous enemy; the Klingons. The fact that to win they must persuade the Klingons that they can be trusted serves to make it more interesting and the conflict before than involves some enjoyable sword fighting action. We also get Chekov ranting about wanting revenge for the death of an imagined brother and even the doctor is demanding revenge. The regular cast do a solid job but it is Michael Ansara's strong performance as Kang that stands out; this performance enables us to believe Kang would torture Chekov to death in an early scene and also believe he would agree to a truce when he saw their fighting had no purpose. Susan Howard also puts in a likable performance as Kang's wife, Mara, without whom the peace couldn't have been established. The only real flaw was the fact that nobody seemed to notice the alien entity as it moved around the ship but once they sensors revealed its presence they appeared to be able to see it. Overall though another enjoyable episode.",8

The Klingon vessel breaks down and the Enterprise is blamed for this. Kang, its commander, attempts to to take over the Enterprise but Kirk outwits him. Kirk beams aboard the crew and the Klingon ship is destroyed. Before much can be sorted out though, strange things start to happen aboard the ship. Phasers and other objects are replaced with swords, Star Fleet crew are stranded at inaccessible portions of the ship, wounds are healing at alarming rates, bigotry is running rampant through the minds of all.Well it turns out that an alien creature of unknown origin has snuck aboard the Enterprise and is pitting the two sides against one another. It feeds off hate and violence, making it all the more stronger. Kirk tries to explain this to Kang to no avail. He finally gets through to Kang's wife, Mara. The two leaders convince their crews to lay down their weapons in a temporary truce. The alien leaves after realizing he can no longer feed aboard the Enterprise.Of all the strange aliens we've seen in Star Trek throughout the years, this one maybe amongst the weirdest: a non-corporeal being that feeds off of hate, violence, and bigotry. Reading prior reviews, I'm glad I wasn't the only one reminded of Twin Peaks' BOB during this. Obviously this predates Twin Peaks and it makes me wonder if David Lynch is aware of this episode...Anyways, this is a really solid episode. Not solid as in solid for Season 3, I just mean solid overall. The acting is good, the sets are good, even the budget-limited antagonist works for me. I like that we never find out its origin or its purpose; it's just a ball of energy intent on creating war between the two sides.We never find out what happened to the colony. Part of me wonders if there ever was even one to begin with or was it just something implanted in the minds of the crew by the alien? Regardless, I really enjoyed this episode.

Uhura also shows some signs but not much. Klingons seem all affected but, we see them as enemies so the impact is minor. Kang, Klingon leader, realizes at the end and shakes off hatred. How? If the entity has the power of creating hatred and illusion and control of the ship, why isn't everyone fully affected?The basic idea is fine, an entity that controls others and feeds off their hate.

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. The series didn't seem to mature as it should have but definitely has improved on terms of implementing smarter approach, parallel plot lines and thought provoking concept.Season 03Contrary to expectations, second season failed to project the essential character development which would have give a perfect arc to the series and instead focused on different cases. In this final season the expectations are still higher as they have somehow glued their audience with their gripping screenplay and innovative imagination that doesn't flinch on pushing the boundaries.Day Of The DoveThe structure of the script is fresh and intriguing enough to invest in it along with it, it also has a smarter approach and gripping screenplay that even though relies a lot upon physical sequence, is actually thought-provoking and engaging for the viewers.",

There are some well regarded episodes from the season, however, and ""Day of the Dove"" is among them (currently sporting an 8.0 rating on IMDb).There's a germ of a good idea here, but without spoiling too much I believe it's somewhat undermined by the fact that the attitudes of the factions are often created, not simply manipulated, by the alien entity. It sort of robs the story of any real moral lesson. It does give the actors a nice stage, with even Chekov getting a little bit of gristle to chew on. But as usual it's Shatner and his go big or go home style that gives the stakes the weight they might otherwise have lacked.",7
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky (TV Episode 1968)",Camouflage,"This was an episode of the original Star Trek series that I really liked. Several millenniums ago a civilized race built a giant spaceship and camouflaged it with material to make it look like a moon that was detached from planetary orbit. The reason was to make sure no one looked at it with any suspicions and that the chosen survivors would arrive at a new world and just take up the civilization again. It's gone horribly wrong and the ship never really arrived and now the humanoids living there don't even realize they're living inside a giant ship. The artificial sun and stars are their world. And they've got a giant computer which has taken control and everyone on the ship has a control device implanted in their heads so they never question the will of the 'oracle' or their origins.More than that has gone wrong, the ship is on a collision course with an inhabited Federation planet which brings the Enterprise on a mission to save their associated planet. They discover it is indeed not a floating asteroid or moon, but has signs of life.Deforest Kelley gets a little romance here. He's got a disease that no doubt he diagnosed himself and has months to live. He and high priestess of the oracle Kate Woodville fall for each other and that doesn't stop her from defending her way of life as she sees it.An interesting concept that Star Trek deals with is the notion that a place they come to thinks they are the center of a universe. That is something we earth folks had to learn and some of us still haven't.The Prime Directive about non-interference is something that William Shatner concludes doesn't apply when we're saving two planets from total annihilation. How Shatner and Leonard Nimoy do it you have to see this episode for.",7
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky (TV Episode 1968)",an average Star Trek show with some good points,"This was one of those episodes which William Shatner cited in his book ""Star Trek Memories"" where the Star Trek scripts were declining in either quality, believability or both. Shatner notes that McCoy discovers he's terminally ill and subsequently falls in love with the high priestess of Yonada--Natira. At the show's end, McCoy decides to leave his wife to return to the Enterprise where he is cured by the Yonada's catalogue of advanced medical technology which the Enterprise crew access from Yonada's computer. (p.266) Simply put, there are far too many coincidences in this single episode to make it credible. Moreover, McCoy and Natira's love scenes are generally devoid of passion--something one would not expect from a married couple.Its strange that a laser beam from the Yonada's oracle quickly knocks out Kirk and his party when they first beam down to the Yonada asteroid. But when we reach the conclusion, the oracle doesn't employ a similar device to knock out Spock and Kirk who are now trying to access the oracle's computer? Instead, it reacts by abruptly heating up the room that Kirk and his crew are in. I thought the scene where Spock consults the holy book or 'sacred text' to discover how to which navigate the asteroid in a room that was heating up to nearly intolerable levels was funny. Shouldn't the book have spontaneously caught fire? However, despite these logical shortcomings, the show's overall premise is fine, just nothing spectacular. A grade of 6 or 7 seems very reasonable. I rate it a 7 overall because it appropriately highlights the danger of unquestioningly placing one's faith in religion which is symbolised by the all powerful oracle that is guiding Yonada into a collision course with the Federation planet Daran V which contains 4 billion people. The story's theme that the suppression of dissent and independent thought--through the 'instrument of obedience' which is implanted in every Yonadan citizen--can be dangerous also rings true. Hence, the show's premise is eminently believable even if its execution was problematic.",7
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky (TV Episode 1968)",A Day on the World-Ship of Yonada,"One drawback to this episode is the startling revelation about one of the main crew members in the pre-credits sequence: there's a scene in this early section which has so much dramatic impact that the rest of the episode cannot help but be somewhat anti-climactic in comparison. The plot has to do with one of those enclosed worlds concepts well known in science fiction: the inhabitants of a huge ship built inside an asteroid believe themselves to be on a typical planet - their 'sky' is actually the inner shell of the asteroid - similar to the hollow Earth concept developed by Edgar Rice Burroughs for his Pellucidar sci-fi/fantasy stories. It's intriguing and fanciful; the people of this Yonada have a different (and erroneous) view of the universe. They're not stupid, simply misinformed, and need someone like Kirk and his crew to explain the reality of things, kind of like getting away from the whole 'the Earth is flat' view. The hook to the episode is that things need to be righted pretty fast - Yonada is on a collision course with a planet, set to strike in a little over a year.This isn't that bad of a 3rd season episode, but it doesn't really go anywhere with the intriguing concepts. The story falls back on the now-tiresome 'ruling machine gone wrong' plot, with any of the lackluster tension stemming from the main Enterprise trio getting zapped by this Oracle-instrument as punishment (I also wondered why this machine resorted to heating a room at the end instead of the tried-and-tested zapping attack). The one deviation of the usual scripting is that the high priestess of these people falls for McCoy instead of Kirk (or even Spock or Scotty). This episode is McCoy's story all the way and actor Kelley gets the opportunity to show some range here, further developing the sober dramatic aspects of his character. However, as with the rest of the story, the good set-up is abandoned towards the end: out of necessity, McCoy essentially abandons (not divorces) his new wife and life to continue his adventures on the Enterprise, so that we can see him in a few more episodes for the rest of the 3rd season. If there had been a 4th season, we may have seen a sequel to this episode then. As it is, we never find out what happens regarding the McCoy-Natira relationship, and that's a shame. Or a cheat, if you will.",6
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky (TV Episode 1968)","Hey, could have been worse! ***SPOILER!!***","I'm being a bit unfair. One thing I will say is that this should have been a 2-parter, or at least had better flow and pacing. There was time spent on things that didn't need that much, to the detriment of segments that could have used more time. Overall, it just needed more time to develop things properly. So, better scripting and, certainly, better direction. Still, I always can watch this episode, which is more than I can say for a lot of First Trek. Ms. Woodville is excellent as Natira, although her accent leaves me more than a bit irritated. ""We need her to sound exotic and foreign...I know, a really phony sounding British accent, yeah, that's it!""On the other hand, we do have James Doohan as the voice of the Oracle, and that's a bit of fun. It's also fun to see Bones get the girl. And get the girl he does, at least until the end. I've seen comments about him riding off into the sunset and leaving her behind, but it seemed more like a mutual decision to me. She also had a role to play with her people, and she chose to stay with them. McCoy had a role to play with his people, and he chose to stay with them.Each of them understood the other's decision, even if it pained them. That understanding was a part of who each of them were portrayed to be. Bones was, if anything, responsible, and so was Natira. I do wish the series had gone on long enough to see their scheduled reunion in a year's time.As for the lack of passion, this was television in 1968. There wasn't a lot of passion, at least when the censors were able to avoid it. And Kirk was the love 'em and leave 'em ooey-gooey passionate one on this crew. I think the fact that they married was meant to imply a different kind of passionate side, even if we didn't get to witness it. It also worked better with McCoy's personality; he was just more of a commitment sort of person, and so was Natira.The love scenes were rather stiff and ""directed"" looking, but there was a tenderness to the whole thing, or at least I perceived one. By the way, about the Oracle using the heat at the end, the heat allowed them to be made gradually more uncomfortable, including Natira. Of course, they couldn't kill three stars of the show. This was more necessary and useful. If they had killed Natira outright, they wouldn't have had her to motivate the others to stop what they were doing. (stopping Natira's punishment being a motivator)Yeah, all things being equal, better direction and scripting could have made it better, but it certainly could have been worse!",7
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky (TV Episode 1968)",McCoy finds love on a 'doomed' world,"In the opening scene we learn a shocking truth; Dr McCoy has diagnosed a fatal disease in himself and only has a year to live. For the time being he can still do his job though and insists that he be allowed to do so. Shortly afterwards the Enterprise is fired on; it traces the missile back to Yonada, an asteroid which turns out to be a spaceship. This craft has no life signs and will crash into an inhabited planet in little over a year. Kirk, Spock and McCoy beam onto the 'asteroid' and soon discover that it is a generational ship and its crew, which is very much alive, have no idea that they are on a ship. In fact the fact is deliberately hidden from the people aboard and actions that may lead to the truth coming out are punished by the 'Oracle'. The most senior person there is Natira, the High Priestess of the society, and she is clearly attracted to McCoy and he feels the same way. This makes it easy for him to keep her occupied while Kirk and Spock investigate the Oracle. Unfortunately they are caught and forced to return to the Enterprise. McCoy however decides to spend his final year with Natira. Shortly afterwards he learns that there may be a way to save the people of Yonada but it would mean reading their sacred book; something nobody may do until they reach their destination.This is a decent enough episode which makes up for its lack of action with a more emotional story. The opening revelation the McCoy has only a year to live certainly comes as a surprise although the fact that a cure is found in the end does not. The way the cure is discovered in the Yonada's archives is defiantly one of the least subtle examples of Deus Ex Machina possible! The reason for McCoy's illness is of course to make us believe that he would fall in love with a woman he just met and abandon his life on the Enterprise to stay with her. The idea that the people of Yonada have no clue that they are on a ship is rather interesting as is the fact that those who built the ship created a belief system which actively prevented people discovering the truth before they reached their destination. It was nice to see McCoy getting the woman for once although there was a lack of real passion between him and Natira. Overall a solid but not an outstanding episode.",7
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky (TV Episode 1968)",Brought me to (good) tears,"Reading previous reviews did not talk me out of leaving my comments. In fact, one previous comment in particular ensured that I must leave mine - the comment that deplored it as a bad love story -- so very wrong.I did not consistently see Star Trek TOS when it first came out (I was age 9) because it showed at 6pm - dinner time. Fortunately, within the first few years of reruns, I did see most of them. Now, I'm stepping through them all daily, in order, thanks to the Internet (Netflix). This episode is one of perhaps eight that I never saw back then 40+ years ago. I bet I would have rated it ""too mushy"" back then...This is a love story, couched in a fairly typical SF story. I've read a whole lot of SF, including many with a similar premise. But after following the Star Trek crew through 3 seasons, this is by far the most heartfelt and genuine story in 60+ episodes.This episode brought tears of pleasure to my eyes. Yes, in classic TOS fashion, the acting may have been clumsy, but the story shone through. Though attractive, Miss Woodville was by no means the most stunning of the beautiful actresses in TOS - I am not simply smitten by her as admitted by another reviewer (however I do very much appreciate his being so candid). (In some other episode reviews, I'd have to fess up to a high score just because of the babe.)Put simply: McCoy pledges his entire love, to a woman whom he hardly knows. He trusts her with all his heart. And she trusts him equally. Irregardless of whether or not there are reasons why neither should should trust the other, they do.Yes, yes, I know - McCoy has nothing to lose, he's gonna die in a year anyway -- irrelevant.Yes, yes, I know - In the end, they go separate ways -- I agree, this was a disappointment, but I recognize that they couldn't eliminate the Bones character at this time. (This is the reason for my 9 rating not 10.)Yes, yes, I know - she couldn't marry within her world, she's the high priestess -- unimportant.The bottom line is that these two both believed with all their heart, that this was what they both wanted. And they committed to each other fully. Especially in light of their probably limited future together. What greater love is there?This was a well-formed TOS episode with all the usual stuff, the bridge crew, a red alert, phasers, transporters, a decent but misguided race, an evil in-understandable alien, a love interest, etc.Trying to culminate my thoughts here, I think I can sum it up. All previous episodes, I watched, and (mostly) enjoyed, but was not moved enough to type in a review. In this episode, once I stopped crying, I realized I wanted nothing more in my life than to trade places with McCoy.",9

It is a favourite of mine for number of reasons such as: the scene where Mccoy tells Kirk he has one year to live,the scene where Spock is comforting Mccoy, the scenes between Mccoy and Natira were wonderful as it shows how lonely his character is. Although I had mixed feelings about the ending because of their mutual decision to separate she would have had to become a recurring character in the series.

I wonder why that is, since there were always celebrities willing to flaunt their figures in a sensational way. But Natira did wear her share of eye shadow and those big old false eyelashes, and I had to chuckle over the colorful wardrobe of the Yonada security guard. They looked like they might have been getting ready for an appearance on the Sonny and Cher show.So Natira put the big time move on Dr. McCoy, leaving Captain Kirk out in the cold as the episode's romantic interest. This after gaining the viewer's sympathy that Bones had only a year to live as a result of contracting a terminal case of xenopolycythemia. Those diseases always sounded like the real thing when they were mentioned on the show.Once again, Roddenberry interjects a socio-political and ideological theme with the 'instrument of obedience', an implant that causes physical pain if one's thoughts stray beyond the accepted norm. The Oracle punishes the Enterprise crew a couple of times for daring to challenge, but I have to second some other reviewers here who wondered why the Oracle resorted to the heat treatment instead of the more severe physical pain administered the first time around. Along those same lines, I also wondered why Natira didn't consider that Kirk, Spock and McCoy might have killed the old man who violated the Oracle. There were no witnesses, and the man was already dead when Natira discovered them all together. That was too early in the story for her to be a trusting high priestess.The kicker of course was McCoy's and Natira's mutual decision to part ways after having declared their unique and undying love for each other. That was when McCoy was dying of course, but it IS a little troubling that the script handled their situation so unceremoniously. Come on, they already got married! I guess McCoy was never meant to discover what one might call a new kind of instrument of obedience.",7

When anyone violates the planets MANY picky laws, the machine punishes them severely--and in some cases kills them. When the three try to help out or make friends, they only get electrocuted for their efforts. Kirk and Spock leave to go back to the Enterprise, but oddly, McCoy falls quickly in love with the priestess of this goofy religion. He has learned he is dying and apparently wants some love, companionship and possible shag before he dies. Later, Kirk and Spock return and the three guys manage to decipher a code and open up the computer controlling everything so they can stop its dictatorial reign. All is right with this small world and now, inexplicably again, McCoy says goodbye to his new wife and she is never mentioned again. While I thought that the episode didn't really address McCoy's illness at the end, another IMDb user (anthony_poulton_smith) pointed out that it was implied that using knowledge from this planet that he was cured. However, I really wish this had been spelled out better--perhaps they were running short on time.

Truth is what the rulers-or ruler-will decide on. It does recycle the controlling computer idea from ""Return of the Archons""-I wonder if those who built the Oracle saw Landru's plans ?

I was smitten by Kate Woodville as the high priestess.At the time I first focused on this episode, in the mid-1980s, I was captivated by a blonde vixen on the soap Days of Our Lives, Anna DiMera, played to perfection by Leanne Hunley.Hunley would leave the soap and I was without my cunning minx with the enchanting smile fix.Hunley, having since returned to Days, can perhaps best be seen today in the Beverly Hillbillies movie as the woman talking to Jim Varney who thinks she is a prospective wife for him.Anyway, Woodville, when I first saw her here, was a good look-alike to Hunely, but alas, her character was nowhere near as lively as Anna DiMera.Nevermind that Woodville appeared statuesque and amazonian, I would later realize that this was clearly the costume and the headdress doing this for her, not that she was a short woman to begin with.Even still, this episode with all of its McCoy is dying plot, and the Bonanza wife who disappears at the end of the episode (well, at least she didn't die!

Of course, he will not allow Kirk to divulge this to the crew. After a thwarted missile attack, the Enterprise locates the source. It is an asteroid/planet where people live inside, unaware of the grandness of space. They are part of a civilization that built a huge ship when their sun went nova and have been traveling the galaxy for thousands of years. The usual trio beams down to the planet and is taken hostage by a group of soldiers wearing really weird hats and colorful robes. They are also met by a beautiful priestess. It turns out that there is a creator in their past who has been looking out for them, but they must don a kind of implant that forces their obedience to an oracle. Since McCoy and his illness are center stage here, he becomes the focus of this episode. The priestess is so taken with him that she proposes marriage and he accepts. The other, more critical plot element is that this asteroid is on a collision course with a very populous planet; the resulting impact would be devastating. As with the American Indian episode, they must find a way to get things to change course. The twosome must work their way to adjust a force that could destroy them. This is a pretty typical ST episode, neither good nor bad.",7
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky (TV Episode 1968)","The world is hollow, and we have touch the sky!","This is one of the best Star Trek episodes ever. It has problems. The story is derivative. An asteroid that is really a ship is uncontrollably heading to a populated Federation planet. Dr. McCoy is sick and has one year to live. He is offered love and he accepts. Given his predicament, why not, most would probably take it. The villain is the Oracle/computer that controls the asteroid/ship, it has lost control. Here's my main problem with this episode. If the original planet and solar system of the Fabrini exploded 10,000 years ago, how the hell does Spock have so much information about them. Never explained. Maybe they should have thrown in a line about satellites or other Fabrini colonies that retained this information. Other than that. What we have is the Oracle/computer controlling the people like Big Brother, with the Instrument of Obedience. Pain and death comes to anyone who questions the Oracle. The people must not know that they are inside a giant generational space ship. This may be understandable for the survival of the people. There should be some control, but it looks like the control went too far, into complete ignorance, deception, punishment and death.I had no problem with Dr. McCoy and Natira falling in love quickly. First, it's a 50-minute show. Second, Bones is a goner, simple choice stay or go. Third, the acting and dialogue was solid between them. Bones even say ""But we are strangers to each other"" and Natira responds intelligently. All the acting was solid. The opening scene with the missiles heading to the enterprise, with the heavy Black Sabbath music, was incredible. Kirk enter, quick questions and answers, they shoot down the missiles and trace where they came from. Great, no nonsense. They Bones and Nurse Chap argument and Kirk comes in and Bones notifies that everyone on board has had their annual checkup and is fine, except for one, himself, he has a year to live. This is all great acting. Straight to the point. Natira was also great, strong, intelligent and beautiful. The Fabrini old man was in one great scene, and he says the title, when I was younger I climbed the mountains even though it was forbidden and he found out ""For the World is Hollow, and I Have Touched the Sky"". Even though all Fabrini had the Instrument of Obedience, possibly when the old man climbed the mountain the Oracle had not lost control then and wasn't punishing people as badly.Music throughout was great. The opening scene was incredible. The cinematography was great. Tons of close ups with reaction shots. The new cgi was just incredible. The enterprise moving in angles, the shots of the asteroid, enterprise passing under the asteroid. This was cinema quality. This has it all, except dead red shirts. All the main cast of 7 are there. Only a few other Enterprise extras. The acting was solid all around. One of the best Star Trek episodes.",10

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. The series didn't seem to mature as it should have but definitely has improved on terms of implementing smarter approach, parallel plot lines and thought provoking concept.Season 03Contrary to expectations, second season failed to project the essential character development which would have give a perfect arc to the series and instead focused on different cases. In this final season the expectations are still higher as they have somehow glued their audience with their gripping screenplay and innovative imagination that doesn't flinch on pushing the boundaries.For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the SkyThe first half is spent on Dr. McCoy's love track which as always is repetitive and slows the episode a bit but its second one is where the scrutiny kicks in and it evolves into something far better than one would have expected.",

The Enterprise disrupts missiles with their origin set towards an asteroid which is actually a disguised ship with a hollow center which houses the life of a race of humanoids worshipping a machine that secretly keeps text from them, knowledge they truthfully could use to help prevent a cataclysmic collision course with a world featuring three million people. McCoy falls in love with the leader of this people, who encourages him to stay with her when Kirk and Spock return to the Enterprise. The machine ""god"", called Oracle, punishes the people with pain emitted from small implants in their faces if they behave in a way deemed threatening. McCoy becomes the leader's mate and realizes that the asteroid ship could be fixed if the ancient text is read and the tech learned so that the collision course can be diverted, repairing a flaw in one of the engines. The Oracle will need to be put in its place, though.While I think the last twenty minutes are anticlimactic and leave this episode feeling average despite a good hook for staying tuned - McCoy dying - the performances are wonderful. DeForest Kelley is really good and so sympathetic, truly providing his doctor with a quiet courage and vulnerable but not weak. He sees love as never before, further realizing how lonely his life has been, given a respite it seems in the year that remains with this lovely woman knowing he's dying and offering him a person to spend his final days with. The ending is a cop out mainly because the plot has nowhere to go but to the obvious conclusion... McCoy will not die and will return to the Enterprise absent this new woman he has fallen in love with. How does the script get McCoy out of his demise...""Hey, we found medical knowledge in the text of this alien race"". Spock's learning of McCoy's condition and the hand on the shoulder, with the unhidden concern speaks volumes. No matter how many times they debate and suffer argument over matters that come upon them during their missions on Enterprise. Kirk suffering but trying to hide it the best he can is a credit to Shatter, who always does that excellently. Once again, the machine that holds sway over a race of ignorant people is usurped by Kirk and Spock...no mechanism, no matter how superior or advanced, can match the captain and his number one! Katherine Woodville is the leader, Natira, and her understated performance is just right opposite Kelley, as the two share a warm and caring bond that is organic.",6

Even more interesting, the inhabitants don't know they are living in an asteroid and that there is a universe outside of their world. Unfortunately, their asteroid world is on a collision course with a planet and Kirk must help them. The crew meets up with the high priestess of the people who is guided by an oracle. Kirk and the crew must convince the people of the truth or get to the asteroid's controls and deflect it from its collision course. But the oracle has significant powers and is very protective of the control room. If you can ignore the low-budget feel and mediocre acting of this third-season Star Trek production, the plot is quite engaging. There are even ancient markings in the oracle room that the crew must decipher in order to proceed to the control room. There was just one gaping failure in the whole show: McCoy's love affair and marriage to the high priestess. The dialogue is so poorly written, the acting so badly executed, the body motions so stiff and robotic, and the entire premise so absurd, that it was painful to watch. McCoy, a seasoned doctor loyal to his ship, suddenly wants to abandon his post and stay on the asteroid because he met some dim alien girl with whom he shares nothing in common. The writers throw in the fact that McCoy has a recently-acquired terminal illness to make it all more plausible, but that just makes the love story seem more manufactured. McCoy professes an undying and eternal love for this alien girl he just met, and then leaves her by the end of the show. The scenes where they were professing their love seemed more like they were in the middle of getting a root canal. Because McCoy's character is generally likable and non-sensical, I found these scenes quite demeaning to his character.",6

They unceremoniously phaser and destroy the missiles, and then back-track their course, to their point of origin. WHY the unprovoked attack !! ?? It's never revealed !! Later, the people of Yonada end up being peaceful and benevolent, VERY uncharacteristic of a race that would launch missiles at a passing spacecraft !!It seems that this missile attack was used as a means of getting the Enterprise to pay a visit to Yonada, to investigate the reason for the attack.

Regardless of the wisdom or lack thereof of this eventuality, it couldn't be assumed that the collision course would remain through an actual collision.Second: When Natira and McCoy mutually decide to part ways, McCoy's illness is still considered incurable.

The ship appears to be automated, but when Bones, Spock, and Kirk head down to the surface, they are captured by the people of Yonada. The residents aren't aware they are aboard a spaceship, they believe that this is their planet; in fact, they live inside its hollow shell. This asteroid is barreling towards a heavily-populated planet and will most likely destroy both the planet and itself, all the people along with it.The people of Yonada worship and obey the will of the Oracle, a structure inside a holy room which decrees right and wrong. The people all have implants in their heads known as the Instrument of Obedience which punish them anytime they break the rules or think for themselves.The high priestess quickly falls for Bones. It has been revealed at the beginning of the episode that McCoy has a terminal illness which gives him a year to live. The two quickly fall for each other and agree to marry. Spock and Kirk get in trouble for snooping around. Bones asks the priestess to let them go and he shall remain with her and live out the remainder of his shortened life.But Spock and Kirk won't rest until they figure out how to divert the asteroid, Prime Directive be damned! Bones joins the cult of Yonada and learns its secrets. He tries to relay how to alter course to Kirk but the Instrument of Obedience prevents him. By now, Spock has discerned that these people are the descendants of the Fabrini, an ancient race whose solar system was destroyed many many years ago. They must have built this ship and sent it out to space to find a new planet. For whatever reason, these descendants aren't aware of their history.Spock is able to translate some text and find the ship's controls. He turns off the Oracle and reroutes the ship on it's original heading. Apparently it's about a year away from its destination. Conveniently, Spock finds a wealth of medical knowledge in the Fabrini's databanks. They have the cure to Bones' disease and he is able to be fully cured.The hilarious part of these serialized episodes that occurred back in the day is that almost always you had to resolve any conflicts you introduced within the episode. Here we learn that Bones is terminal, an absolutely devastating plot development. But by the end of the episode, an illness that has no cure, which is prevalent throughout the galaxy, an illness in which we can assume multiple species have spent lots of time and money researching, an illness that Bones was diagnosed with like 12 hours ago, this illness's cure just happens to be found by Bones' ship. What are the odds?! What a strange B-plot to add in.This entire plot is a bit out of whack. We never learn why these people aren't aware of their origins. Why is it necessary to hide this from them? And then there's the romance between Bones and the priestess: I don't buy it. There's no real starting point to explain it, Kirk just kind of mentions she has eyes for McCoy and we go from there. I found it all bizarre.The Instrument of Obedience is the only thing I enjoyed. It's a cool idea, I just wish it wasn't wasted on such a messy episode like this one. Also, the Fabrini men have some insane hats.",5
23,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky (TV Episode 1968)",McCoy meets girl,"A McCoy episode, and good riddance to that. I've always loved McCoy, in fact he's probably my second favorite character in TOS behind Scotty, with that said you can probably guess that I might have liked this episode a little more than I should. After all it was a pretty bland episode tackling the classic what if the world was a ship sci fi concept. Though one disappointing aspect for me was that the episode seemed pretty much looked into two sets the enterprise bridge and the oracle room.The episode goes as follows..The enterprise finds an asteroid that seems to be on course for a federation colony, on closer look they determine the asteroid is in fact a large ship, meanwhile dr McCoy informs the captain that a member of the crew is suffering of a terminal illness with no cure, as Kirk dramatically asks McCoy who it is McCoy responds that he himself is the one suffering of the disease and that he has a year or so left to live. Kirk takes Spock and McCoy with him and beams down to the asteroid/ship, there they find a group of people that stuns him and takes them into their city I think? There they learn of the oracle a talking altar that basically rules the planet, the oracle talks with the high priestess as it Is revealed these aliens have lived on this ship for 10,000 years the crew surmises that the aliens no longer realize they are on a ship and believe this to be a planet, Kirk and the landing party are then punished by getting quickly zapped by the oracle (jeez tough crowd). Kirk and Spock awake while McCoy remains unconscious, Kirk reveals to Spock that McCoy is terminally ill and that's why he's knocked out, an old guy walks in after McCoy wakes up and gives a brief speech on the world being a lie while directly quoting the episode title in there (blah cliches am i right) then immediately collapses and dies. The high priestess Natira comes in and has the dead man taken away while mumbling some stuff about punishment and blasphemy blah blah blah. She gives the landing party a little history lesson and seems to take a liking to McCoy. Spock and like make their way into the oracle room to investigate the oracle but hey detected and zapped. The oracle declares they are to die but McCoy puts on his charm on Natira and gets her to let them beam up while McCoy while stay there and live out the remainder of his life with her (talk about love at first sight). McCoy is made an official resident of the asteroid/ship/planet through his initiation which includes implanting a punishment device in his skull (kinky!) and gives him a look at the secret book of their people (also why is it secret if they didn't know there were alien species out there, why did they plan ahead and build a whole secret compartment for it?). After taking an oath of secrecy on the topics of the book McCoy immediately contacts the ship and gets to gossiping all he can (seriously in the very next scene!), McCoy explains that the book can be used to alter the asteroid/ship/planets's course and save the colony and the people of yanada (the name of th asteroid/ship/planet), the oracle detects McCoy's treachery and uses the punishment device previously implemented to zap him till he's knocked unconscious. Despite being cleared of responsibility by Starfleet Kirk beams right down to the planet and finds an unconscious McCoy, Kirk and Spock remove McCoy's punishment device, but before they can change the course of the asteroid/ship/planet nature walks in and orders them arrested, that is until Kirk talks her into believing that yanada is a ship and that they aim to save it, so after all that they go to the oracle room. The oracle yells at them but they open the secret compartment and use the book to alter the course, and in it Spock finds out that the book contains far more advanced medical knowledge than that of the federation and then they cure McCoy just like that, and so everything is right again.Now there was nothin really special about this episode. Some real big questions s for me such as the aforementioned secret compartment and why it was built, or a bigger question why did Natira instantly believe that yanada was a ship, I mean she's introduced to us as this fully devoted individual that believes everything of the oracle and then she just happens to buy the word of three aliens who have literally broken her planets laws at every chance and been convicted to death before, nah uh I don't buy it, I mean if someone told you earth was a spaceship you would just say they're crazy but she instantly believes it. Anyways I'm going off topic, the acting was ok but not great, and there was never really a sense of urgency or danger in the episode I mean the whole a ship will crash into a colony in like 2 weeks thing doesn't strike immediate danger does it. Still it's always fun when Star Trek tackles common sci-fi topics like this so extra points on that,. All in all it ends up as a vey meh episode, not one you will hate but not exactly memorable (seriously I watched this yesterday and had to google the episodes plot because it's so forgettable, not a good sign).",7

We learn that McCoy has an apparent rare blood disease that gives him a year to live, obviously self- diagnosed.

It turns out the asteroid is actually a ship, governed and controlled by a computerized oracle that is a cross between Donald Trump and the Pope.The beautiful young priestess of the religion takes one look at McCoy and falls deeply in love. Here is where you have to suspend your credulity, unfortunately.McCoy returns her affection and they marry. Meanwhile Kirk and Spock are trying to outsmart the oracle, which is on a dangerous collision course.Not one of my favorite episodes.The plot seems contrived, and the romance is not at all convincing. The theme of the people being controlled by a computer has been used too much at this point. The plaid coats worn by the ship's inhabitants look like cheap blankets.

1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Tholian Web (TV Episode 1968)",A very strong third season Trek episode,"The Tholian Web is, after ""The Enterprise Incident"", perhaps the best episode of the final Star Trek season. While the plot is indeed slow moving, it certainly cannot be called boring. The Enterprise finds the USS Defiant adrift in space and Captain Kirk with 3 crew members beam down to investigate the situation only to discover that the Defiant's crew have killed one another. Then the Defiant disappears from view before Captain Kirk can be beamed aboard the Enterprise and is presumed lost. Shortly thereafter, the Star Trek crew find themselves trapped in hostilities with the completely alien Tholians who view the presence of the Enterprise in their space as a hostile act. The Enterprise crew slowly goes berserk--in a pocket of space where this manifestation previously destroyed the USS Defiant's crew--while Spock and McCoy bicker endlessly with one another over Command since Kirk is no longer around to referee their disputes.The situation seems hopeless until Spock and McCoy listen to Kirk's taped and touching last testament to them and decide to reconcile and work together to solve the ship's predicament. When Uhura sees Captain Kirk's ghostly appearance, she thinks she is going crazy like the rest of the crew until Spock himself sees Kirk floating throughout the ship. As the Tholian Web nears completion, and the USS Enterprise faces imminent destruction, Spock manages to beam and hold onto the signature traces of Kirk's latest appearance--before the captain's oxygen supply is depleted--before warping the Enterprise out of the nearly finished Tholian Web. If this is boring, I don't know what isn't! There is even a public memorial held by the crew in memory of Captain Kirk. ""The Tholian Web"" is one of the highlights of the third Trek season and certainly caught people's attention since it was nominated for an Emmy in special effects although it didn't win--as I once thought. This episode belongs among my top 20 Star Trek shows and shows what can happen when good script writing and direction--qualities missing in many of the inferior Trek shows of the third season--come together. This may be the only Trek episode with 2 different directors: Ralph Senensky who was fired midway through filming and then replaced by Herb Wallerstein. According to Senensky on his web site, the reason this happened was because the new authorities at Paramount bungled the delivery of the space suits on day 1 of the production of this episode which led to production delays of this episode. In order to avoid blame and show who was in control, the Executive in Charge of Production at Paramount, D. Cramer, fired Senensky and publicly announced Senensky's termination--which resulted in Ralph Senensky being blacklisted from directing any films anywhere for 6 long months. (until Herb Solow intervened with a project) One of the reviewers mentioned here that it was unlikely a ship would allow itself to be trapped in the Tholian's Web but the reason given for the Enterprise's action is 'logical': if Spock moved the ship, he risked disrupting the local space time continuum thereby losing all hope of locating and saving Kirk in time.",9
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Tholian Web (TV Episode 1968)",Season Three Is Still Good... Here's Proof,"Season three is holding up pretty well in my re-watching of the DVD set in series order. The Tholian Web is an excellent episode, at least top 30 of all the Trek TOS made. Here we see another Starship (The Defiant, I believe) losing its whole crew to a space madness, plus its phasing in and out of the dimension! The landing party don space suits (!) for the first and only time here, proof that the writers were at least trying to keep this series alive; despite it never cracking the top 30 shows TV ratings in its total run. We also get a new alien with comparable weapons, and its own unique ones at that, the Tholians! Add on top of that, cool scenes with Chekov, Dr McCoy and Scottie; and Spock becomes the Captain, this is on the level with seasons one seriousness with the crew and adds seasons threes chemistry between Kirk, McCoy and Spock, making it must watch Trek TOS. McCoy and Spock further their friendship and respect for each other here adding to the chemistry that would later on make the movies so good. A goof I noticed, the officer (a one strip on the sleeve type) beaming Kirk is an Ensign or close to that rank, the hand we see moving the slides is that of CDR Scott with two gold strips. Oh well I'm sure there are lots of others to make fun of but than this wouldn't be a cool show to watch if you nit picked. McCoys spacesuit went for 125,000 US dollars on auction recently, so there are those who think this was a great episode other than me. LLAP",9

It has a worthy adversary, the Tholians. It has Kirk caught somewhere between his physical being and his molecules spread across the universe. It has McCoy viciously attacking Spock and his decisions, time after time, questioning his very integrity. Meanwhile, the space they are in has destroyed an entire crew of another ship and is affecting the Enterprise crew. Oh, yes, the Tholians, who are ticked because Spock fired phasers at them, are building a web to tie the Enterprise up for eternity. All these plot elements are interconnected and eventually come to a head. There were certainly some very good episodes in the third season and this is one of them. It's also intriguing how McCoy can be so cruel (almost racist) to Spock but never offers anything of any use to solve the problems. Of course, in this one he is suffering a bit of space sickness. Anyway, they are an interesting pair.",9
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Tholian Web (TV Episode 1968)",Great visual effects episode,"I just wanted to comment on ""The Tholian Web"" being one of the best episodes of the entire Star Trek original series, as far as visual effects. For 1968, the visuals in this episode are pretty interesting, from the Defiant phasing in and out, to the Tholian ship and their energy web, to the Tholian commander himself, who was also created through a visual effect, not an actor. And in ""The Tholian Web,"" as well as the rest of the third season, there are much better visual effects camera shots of the Enterprise exterior, than in the first two seasons. And finally, these exterior shots even helped years ago when I was building my model kit of the Enterprise, as far as painting and decal references. Good visual treat, in addition to the episode's story.",7

Uhura: ""An antidote for russkiness?"" McCoy: ""No. An antidote for overacting."" In spite of its several flaws, one of the better ST episodes - if for no other reason than because it deals with sci-fi matters, instead of being yet another badly-disguised soap-opera (""Amok Time"", ""The Paradise Syndrome"") or a story with elements of witchery/sorcery instead of science (""A Private Little War"").Exactly half-way through the episode Spock does what he'd never done before: he explains/summarizes the plot of the first half at Kirk's ""funeral"". Had the writers of ST lost that much confidence by that point in their viewers? But I guess that this way even the dimmest Trekkie can follow the story-line without getting too confused.In the meantime, McCoy draws the most illogical conclusion of his emotion-stained career as medical officer: because Spock stayed to look for Kirk, that, in McCoy's mind, proved that Spock wanted to make sure that Kirk is dead, so that Spock can take over as captain! Ironically, only a minute later, Kirk's video-message is played and in it he praises this supposed ""wisdom"" that McCoy has. The wisdom of reaching idiotic conclusions? In that case nobody isn't wise... A little later, just to underline how utterly wrong Kirk's positive appraisal of McCoy's intellectual abilities was, McCoy PREVENTS Uhura from telling Spock that Kirk is still alive.Still... apart from McCoy's over-the-top anti-spockness and his total lack of interest in Kirk's alleged demise, TTW is light years ahead of episodes such as ""Turnabout Intruder"" or ""Naked Time"".",

In an eerie sequence of scenes, we see that the Defiant's crew appears to have killed each other. This shifting space also affects the brains of humans, causing a degeneration into insanity. These and later scenes recall the bouts of insanity in ""Is There in Truth no Beauty?"" earlier this same season. Unfortunately, Kirk should have left Chekov on the Enterprise; Scotty is able to beam back only 3 of them at a time and the Defiant fades away before they can get Kirk back - he's gone, all the way gone (there's something about the number 3 on this show). They even hold a funeral service for Kirk later; yes, this is Kirk's final episode...just kidding. Then the Tholians show up. They're territorial and want the Enterprise outta there!Like about half of the 3rd season episodes, this is saddled with a snail pace in spots, but the alien Tholians almost make up for this. While we were still seeing actors in lame appliances 20 and 25 years later on the later series (TNG, DS9, etc.) to display alien reps, here we see a truly innovative attempt at visualizing an alien race, complete with an unusual audio signature. You won't soon forget the Tholians. Their energy web - well, that's another matter: seems to me this tactic would work only if an enemy vessel sat unmoving for an hour or two, not using its weaponry. How often does that happen? This episode is also unusual in that Kirk shows up only in the pre-credits scenes, the first act and then disappears until the last 5 minutes (not counting his shots as a ghost). Hence, we observe a new group dynamic shifting into place to fill in the gap: Spock & McCoy further their tense relationship, while Scotty moves in to complete a new trinity. There's an interesting scene with the trio in Spock's quarters near the end, just before final maneuvers are to be made and Scotty walks off with obvious plans to get drunk.",7
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Tholian Web (TV Episode 1968)",Solid Episode,"One of my favorite aspects of the series is how the Enterprise is always the second starship on sight coming in just after the first has met their demise. (Doomsday Machine, Immunity Syndrome etc...) Here the unlucky starship is the Defiant which is still in tact but the crew has gone mad. Our heroes beam over to the defiant in some cool looking space suits. Seemingly the crew of the Defiant has gone mad and killed each other due to the proximity of the area of space that they have entered. Chechov ventures to the lower decks and upon returning to the Enterprise is afflicted with the same madness.Of note is that Kirk is lost when the Defiant is sucked in to inter space which apparently exists when two galaxies overlap. The task is now to get Kirk back and the other members of the crew are allowed to shine in Kirks absence. Spock is in command and McCoy is his foil until they watch a recording Kirk has left for them.Scotty of course in in engineering working his magic and McCoy is able to remedy the madness problem. Spock shows a somewhat human side when he welcomes Checkov and Uhura back to their positions on the bridge.All in all a good episode.Why didn't communicators come with some sort of voice mail function?",7
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Tholian Web (TV Episode 1968)",Classic Star Trek- The Tholian Web,"The Enterprise answers a distress signal from another ship, the USS Defiant, not knowing what lies in wait. Kirk, Spock, Bones, and Chekhov board the Defiant, finding the entire crew dead, having killed each other. The transporter is malfunctioning and only three can return to the Enterprise. The Defiant and Captain Kirk become ""interspatially trapped"", dissolving, with a possible ""interphase"" the only hope of rescuing him. This area of space, where dimensions ""rift"", causes not only the loss of the Defiant and Kirk, but a type of angry dementia where those afflicted act out in a violent, uncontrollable rage. Like in a lot of instances throughout the Trek's various series, we see the result of another ship's tragic demise, planting a seed in our minds as to how the Enterprise crew will try to not wind up suffering a same fate, avoiding the similar circumstances.I agree with other reviewers on this site that ""The Tholian Web"" is a strong entry in the maligned Third season, allowing us to see Spock in charge, butting heads with Bones over the right strategic methods to escape their current predicament, only to settle their grievances after a taped recording from Kirk, in case of his death, disrupted the hostility stirring between them. Spock treats his command with logic and absent an influx of emotion, a goal to not only save Kirk, but get the Enterprise out of an evolving jam. These race called the Tholians are angry with the Enterprise occupying their part of space, threatening to blast them to atoms, before Spock returns the favor with a phaser burst that knocks the alien ship for a loop. A second Tholian ship emerges, joining forces with the injured first ship, forming a type of ""web"", a trap which will imprison them if Scotty cannot get the transporter to operate as well as the warp engines, both of which are losing power. The tension between Spock and Bones (Spock repeats over and over to Bones that he belongs in the laboratory testing for a cure to the dementia epidemic, instead of barking at him in regards to his commanding methods), the rising cases of those with dementia, the steadily forming Tholian energy web slowly trapping the derelict Enterprise, Kirk's possible death, and absence of warp engines, test the resolve of everyone on board the ship. I damn well think this is a plot that works well and has lots of suspense. I am starting to think the third season might have some gems ripe for reevaluation. Uhura (in her Swahili civilian attire and quarters, a nice scene for Nichele Nichols) and Scottie both see a ""figment"" of Kirk appear on the Enterprise, then disappear, their testimony of this falling on skeptical ears, considered just delusional desire for his being alive. The idea of the Enterprise befalling the same interspatial fate as the Defiant also adds some extra uncertainty to an already distressing sequence of events. Seeing practically an entire episode absent Kirk I consider quite an alluring factor for Trek fans as we experience the ship in a perilous situation, this time with the pressure applied to Spock who never wavers even as Bones contradicts him on numerous occasions. And Spock takes some chances that might or might not result in saving the ship and its crew, such as the decision to not leave Kirk, because any movement might have resulted in never recovering him, or ordering the starting of the warp engines at 70 % as the web is closing, entering the rift, quite a dangerous risk. All in all, ""The Tholian Web"" is a peculiar Trek episode in that it shows how Spock handles an onslaught of crises and prevails. The tractor beam on Kirk before his gutsy warp into the rift shows that Spock could indeed multitask—and perhaps captain his own starship if such an opportunity had arisen. My favorite scene, besides the viewing of Kirk's speech to Bones and Spock, who receive it after a heated (well heated from Bones, Spock still remains like a mountain unmoved)argument, has Spock, Bones, and Scottie together about to drink the concoction from the good doctor, a poison diluted with alcohol (Scottie owns this scene as he plans to apply Scotch to the ""cure"" for extra potency!). This episode really gave others a chance to shine without Kirk; ""The Tholian Web"" is well worth a look (if just to see Chekhov explode in furious anger at Spock!).",8
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Tholian Web (TV Episode 1968)",Caught in a trap,"Responding to a distress signal from the USS Defiant they discover it and an away team beams over only to discover the crew dead; apparently as a result of them attacking each other. Then the Defiant starts to disappear; Scotty tries to beam the away team back but Kirk is left behind. He is trapped in interspace; the overlap of two universes and it will be a few hours while before a rescue attempt can be made. While preparing for the rescue it becomes apparent that whatever caused the Defiant's crew to become violent is starting to affect the crew of the Enterprise. As time comes for the rescue an alien ship turns up; it is the Tholians demanding that the Enterprise leaves their space; shots are exchanged and the rescue fails. Kirk is declared dead and Spock takes command although it might not be for long as the Tholians are constructing a mysterious energy web around the damaged Enterprise. While McCoy struggles to find a cure to the violence and engineering works on repairs Uhuru sees a ghostly image of the Captain; this is put down to grief but then Scotty and later the entire bridge crew see him is he alive? Can he be rescued? Can they escape the Tholian Web?!This classic season three episode is notable for the fact that for most of the story Kirk is considered dead. With Kirk away tensions soon rise between the logical Spock and the emotionally driven McCoy about how the ship is being run interestingly McCoy is blaming Spock for endangering the ship by hanging around to try to rescue the Captain one would have expected McCoy to be stating the case for rescue while Spock stated that it was illogical. DeForest Kelley and Leonard Nimoy were on top form as McCoy and Spock in these scenes as well as in the final scene where they claim not to have watched Kirk's video will (which they had). The Tholians were interesting foes, despite the fact that we don't see much of them, and their web provided a nice threatthis was helped by some nice special effects. Overall an interesting episode which, while primarily character driven, still manages to keep the tension high.",9

The Enterprise in previously uninvestigated territory run across the USS Defiant, a ship that is considered derelict and it vanished 3 weeks prior. Space is essentially breaking up, according to Spock's readings and logic. Sensors do not pick up the Defiant but they see it on their viewing screen, and their is no response from the ship when hailed. Kirk, Spock, Chekhov and McCoy board the Defiant wearing protective gear - they find 2 crew members dead, one seemingly about to chock the other when they died... looking like maybe a mutiny was about to occur. McCoy examines them and finds the Defiant's captain's neck broken. Kirk calls for some security because they fear that mutineers are aboard the ship and have all area of the Defiant searched... then he cancels the the security crew orders to Mr. Scott. All are dead on the Defiant when the ship is searched. While searching the area Chekov is overcome by something, almost fainting. Bones reported that all appeared to have killed each other on the Defiant. Then McCoy reports that the ship is dissolving, his hand just went though a solid object. The Enterprise can see the Defiant dissolving and is happening to the Enterprise as well. Only 3 can be beamed back aboard the Enterprise, Kirk decides to beam back last and he his disappeared along with the Defiant before Scotty can get him back to the ship. All contact with Kirk has been lost, with Spock in command of the Enterprise they must find away to get Kirk back before the Enterprise and crew disappears as well. Another problem: they must do this before all crew members go mad and kill each other or they will have the same fate as the Defiant. Time/Space fabric is ripping apart at that part of the Universe so it's a race against time - and space. The Tholians have taken over at area of space and will tolerate deceit - they are also punctual as Spock pointed out.This is an episode that I recall rarely being shown on TV in the 80s when I was watching Star Trek fairly regularly. Having acquired all the Star Trek episodes recently, I am very pleased to see this one again. The Tholians are indeed a good foe and they are up against the always logical Mr. Spock acting as captain of an excellent starship crew. A very exciting episode.9.5/10",9
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Tholian Web (TV Episode 1968)","""Uh, Mr. Spock gave the orders, and I found the answers"".","Even as the series was winding down and plot elements were being rehashed, there were still a couple of new ideas used here. This was the first time for example, that a personnel conference was held aboard the Enterprise, called by Mr. Spock, to explain the Captain's apparent demise in an interspacial overlap between galaxies. This was also the first (and only?) time that the primary crew used space suits to beam down to The Defiant. If I'm recalling correctly, no reason was actually given for the suits, Kirk and Company just arrived in the Transporter Room wearing them and that was that. They could have made something up.Say, didn't Chekov go berserk just a couple of weeks earlier in Season III's ""Day of the Dove""? The writers probably should have spread the madness around to other members of the cast to keep things a little more varied, but what the heck. You just never know how the deteriorating effects of inter-space is going to affect someone.The episode also had that interesting visual with the cross hatch pattern of the Tholian Web. It had the effect of creating a claustrophobic feel as if the Enterprise was being hemmed in, or caught in a spider's web if you will. Which would have been harder to do than it looked in the vast expanse of outer space, but it seemed to work here. True to form, Captain Kirk is saved at the v-e-r-y l-a-s-t m-i-n-u-t-e with not a second to spare. I just wonder how even Captain Kirk can keep perspective after being pulled out of the fire so many times throughout three seasons of the show.",7
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Tholian Web (TV Episode 1968)",Good episode but.....,This is definitely one of the stronger episodes from season three. Well acted and emotional. The Aliens themselves are well represented and make a refreshing change from the usual rubber masks. However (and I thought this back in 1973 when I first saw the episode) it is let down slightly because the aliens have silly voices and are poorly scripted.Hence they lacked credibility - perhaps it would have been far better to have left them silent with the ship being in 'time jeopardy' inferred from the electronic cage that was being generated.Such a pity they weren't given more money for the final series - just think if the series had continued it would have begun to have got the benefit of better special effects pioneered by 2001: A Space Odessey. But then I suppose it might have lost some of it's charm and perhaps not become a cult series (heaven forbid),7

With the crew going berserk, Kirk's ghostly 'phasing in and out' and the Tholians closing the trap, the well-written interactions between McCoy and Spock are the one thing the viewer can hang their sanity on.

While the rest of the party investigating this derelict ship get back safely to the Enterprise, Kirk is stuck as the ship disappears forever! It appears he is dead and Spock officiates his memorial service. However, later Uhura and others begin seeing the Captain in his cheesy space suit as he magically appears and disappears in the ship. Perhaps he really isn't dead after all. Unfortunately, although they want to stay and investigate further, the stupid Tholians arrive and try to trap them forever in a giant space web unless they leave.This is a space-bound episode and because they never land on any planets or see any aliens face-to-face, this is a duller and more static episode than average. While it isn't bad, it is poor enough to feel right at home with all the other weaker episodes of season 3 (by most every opinion, the quality of the series dropped in this final year).",6
17,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Tholian Web (TV Episode 1968)",Beware the interphase!,"I found the science fiction of this episode a little too far-fetched. The fabric of space in our universe somehow gets tangled with the space of another universe so that people and objects fade between the two universe, a potentially fatal event known as interphasing. Kirk gets stuck in the other universe, and the crew must get him back solidly in the right universe as he fades back and forth. Spock has never seen such wild phenomena, but somehow he still knows how to calculate exactly when objects will shift between the two universes. To complicate things, the Tholian space ships are very slowly building some kind of giant energy net in order to trap the Enterprise. Overall I found this episode far-fetched. You can't build a workable net out of energy or light beams. Additionally, the net was so big that the Enterprise could just fly through one of the holes. Also, slowly building a space net is a very impractical way to fight a space-traveling enemy. Ships don't usually sit around and wait for you to build a net around them. Why didn't the Tholians just shoot the enterprise or employ a tractor beam if they shun violence? Furthermore, why build a net with holes? It's not like they're fishing and need holes for the water to strain out of. Why don't they just build a complete shell?",5
18,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Tholian Web (TV Episode 1968)",Spock acts out of character endangering the Enterprise for no apparent reason. Then he lies. Not cool.,"So, people love this episode. Why? I don't know. Here's what happens. The Ent finds one of its sister ships, the Defiant, busted and dead in the water. Kirk, McCoy, Spock and Checkoff beam aboard in space suites, and find the crew all dead, apparently killed themselves by strangulation. Checkoff experiences a weird feeling. McCoy's hand passes through a dead corpse and through a table. They decide to beam back to the Ent before the Defiant disappears. Scotchy says the transporter can only beam up 3, so Kirk stays behind. Once the other 3 are on board the Ent, the Defiant with Kirk disappear. Spock's hypotheses is the space near the Defiant is between two universes, ours and the next one, and he calculates that if they wait The Defiant and Kirk will reappear. So far so good.Now, the Tholians show up and they want the Ent out because it is their space. Spock tells them they need to wait for a couple of hours. Once the time is out the Defiant and Kirk don't show up, the Tholaians start shooting and damage the Ent. Ent shoot the Tholains with little damage. Another Tholian ship comes in and they start to build an energy field web around the Ent.Meanwhile, since the space is between two different worlds, peoples brain cells are also disturbed, and a select few people go insane and psychotic, including Checkoff.The Ent is stuck. McCoy blames Spock for endangering the Ent. McCoy finds a cocktail to help with the insanity. Kirk reemerges, and is beamed aboard just in time when the Ent escapes the Tholian web and everybody lives happily ever after. Except for the Defiant and its crew. And all the viewers who cannot understand how anybody could consider this a great episode. Here's the list of problems I found:
1) Spock's decision to stay in a dangerous space endangering the Ent.
2) Spock and McCoy lying to Kirk at the end that they did not view his posthumous message. McCoy fine. But Spock lying, that is pure garbage!
3) Insanity does not affect everyone. Why not? Everyone has neurons and brain cells that may be switching to the other universe.
4) Acting was ok, but the dialogue was mediocre.
5) Music was ok, not great
6) Cinematography was ok, not great.
7) Scotcy is again depicted as a drunkard Scotchman, IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS, he wants to add more alcohol to McCoy's insanity cure. Not cool. 
8) As others have mentioned, the web created by the Tholains would only be effective for ships that just stayed where they were while the Tholians slowly built their web. Very impractical. Most ships would just move away every time these suckers tried to build their web. 
9) Spock and McCoy dialogue is and character are out of character. Only explanation is that they are also going insane. Except the effect is psychotic. They are not acting psychotic. McCoy acts like a jerk. Spock acts not like Spock. Spock would not risk the ship to save one person, even if it's Kirk. So, some good and decent ideas here. That's why it's not getting a 1 star. But given the out of character and the list above, there is no way this is a great episode. I'd rather watch Spock's Brain. At least that's fun.",6

Kirk, Spock, Bones, and Chekov beam over to investigate. The entire crew is dead, apparently they killed one another. While still aboard, the Defiant begins to disappear around them. With the transporter on the fritz, Scotty is only able to beam back 3 at a time. Kirk is still aboard the Defiant as dematerializes. Spock hypothesizes that space is breaking apart at their current location. The Defiant (and Kirk along with it) have been pulled into another dimension via a spatial interphase. He predicts another should occur soon but the Enterprise must not use up any energy or it will alter the spacial dimensions around them. The two dimensions coming into contact here also cause some kind of space madness in people in the area. Some members of the crew start to become violent.So here comes another ship, a member of the Tholian Assembly. The Tholians have claimed this area of space as part of their territory and are prepared to use brute force to make the Enterprise leave. Spock explains the situation to them; they agree to wait for the captain until the allotted time. But due to the disturbance in space the Tholian craft caused, Kirk doesn't reappear as predicted. The angry Tholians attack the Enterprise and disable it.Meanwhile, Bones is working on an antidote for the madness caused by the area they're in. The longer they stay, the more cases become apparent.Another Tholian ship shows up. The two crafts use some type of energy field to start spinning a web around the Enterprise. The goal is never established but I assume they will use this web to transport the Enterprise as some sort of spoil of war. Spock says they need to get out of the web's trap before it is fully formed around them. Meanwhile, some members of the crew begin to see the ghost of Kirk around them.To make matters worse, Spock and Bones can't stop bickering about what should be done next. Bones questions Spock's leadership abilities. Spock tells him to focus on the antidote. Only after watching a recorded tape from Kirk do the two lay aside their differences to achieve their goals.The Enterprise repairs itself and waits around for Kirk to reappear. Bones uses a diluted Klingon poison as a cure for the madness and feeds it to the crew. They grab Kirk, transporting him aboard just before his air runs out and just before the web is complete. They blast out of there, back into Federation space and onto the next mission. I really enjoyed the design of the Tholians in this one. The effects department really thought outside of the box with this one, not allowing themselves to be stuck on humanoid figures. Very cool.The episode itself is fairly decent too. The design of the web (although never adequately explained) is fun to look at and to think about.

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. The series didn't seem to mature as it should have but definitely has improved on terms of implementing smarter approach, parallel plot lines and thought provoking concept.Season 03Contrary to expectations, second season failed to project the essential character development which would have give a perfect arc to the series and instead focused on different cases. In this final season the expectations are still higher as they have somehow glued their audience with their gripping screenplay and innovative imagination that doesn't flinch on pushing the boundaries.The Tholian WebThe material and the characters that are focused in here is exhilarating and new and addition to that the verbal sparring and the conflicts among the crew members once again proves the excellence in writing and helps redefine the genre.",
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Plato's Stepchildren (TV Episode 1968)",the weirdest Star Trek episode,"While 'The Way To Eden' and 'Spock's Brain' often vie for the title of All Time Worst Episode of the original series, I don't think there's a serious contender to the claim of 'Plato's Stepchildren' as All Time Strangest Episode. There were some other oddball entries, no doubt, particularly in the third season but this one about a group of superpowerful humans living in their own version of a Platonian utopia has some very disturbing undertones of depravity, cruelty, and humiliation. The show isn't bashful about putting this perverse behavior on display. It's actually quite daring for its time and place... that an episode of a network TV series back in 1969 would even cover such ground is amazing. Of course, not all of it works. There are many bits that are unintentionally hilarious, others that are cringeworthy. There is the constant reminder in Alexander's treatment by the others of man's inhumanity to man. By way of the Platonian's mind control, Kirk is forced to slap himself (repeatedly), dance, sing, act like a horse, even kiss Uhura before using a bullwhip on her and Nurse Chapel. Spock is similarly humiliated. In an odd turn of events though, Kirk pretty much shrugs off his degradation while Spock takes his, shall we say, very personally. The scene where he and Kirk discuss their mutual ordeal is quite something, and one of the best scenes in the episode. Spock looks like he might implode with anger. Other parts shine as well; the character of Alexander is sharply written and has the best dialogue. Kirk and Spock are eventually able to duplicate the Platonian's power and the overall effect of the final scene is of a bunch of petty bullies being shown up and discredited. (But not before we get to hear Spock warble 'Bitter Dregs,' one of his lesser hits.) I think it is to Star Trek's credit that they were still trying in that last season... the cast and writers and everyone involved weren't just phoning it in, they were still reaching for interesting stories to tell and occasionally succeeding.",6
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Plato's Stepchildren (TV Episode 1968)",Power Corrupts Even Saints on Platonius,"Well, there never were any saints on Platonius, I'd wager. No, I would say that the small grouping of inhabitants on this planet were always egoist boors, even before acquiring their power. Kirk, Spock & McCoy beam down to a culture patterned after ancient Greece, to treat an infection suffered by the group's leader. However, the resemblance to the old-time Greek philosophers & intellectuals is mostly superficial: the jerks here possess vast telekinetic powers and enjoy using them on 'lesser' beings for purposes of humiliation, to satisfy their sadistic need for vicarious entertainment. In other words, they're bored as hell after an existence of over two millennium and the Enterprise crew offer a brief respite from the doldrums. A cautionary take on the 'power corrupts' principle, the episode shows how these Platonians are unable (read: unwilling) to hold back from using their power for even the briefest of periods. Kirk gets the first sampling when Parmen, the leader, forces him to slap himself repeatedly. It gets worse, much worse.This episode probably elicits different reactions from viewers based on their ages and life experiences. I know when I was younger - much younger - I couldn't help but laugh when Kirk & Spock started into their forced Tweedledee & Tweedledum routine. With age, callousness gave way to empathy, and now I sympathize with the heroes, because this is torture and I already know what's next; it reminds me of some of the worst excesses of our history, such as how the Jews suffered under the Nazis or the slavery in America before the 20th century. Unlike their turns at an Abbott & Costello shtick in ""The Trouble With Tribbles,"" when we were laughing with them, here we either laugh at them or boil in anger, in anticipation of some payback. In the end, however, this is a good case study of just how far we've evolved in the 23rd century, according to the Trek-makers: Kirk, Spock & McCoy retain their dignity even as they're humiliated and even when the time for revenge has arrived. We see that they will never revert to some of the base instincts mankind left behind 200 years earlier - it's rather inspirational.This episode is known for the first interracial kiss on TV, occurring between Kirk and Uhura when the Platonians escalate their sadistic manipulations. It's ironic that this kiss is forced and it still caused controversy back in the sixties, though I've also noted attempts to downplay it in later decades, with some stating that the two performers did not actually make contact. Well, it looks like contact to me (I've also read some accounts that Shatner purposely spoiled the takes where they may not be actually touching, forcing the editors to use the take where they were). You can downplay it all you want, but what was the 2nd interracial kiss on TV? I sure don't know, though I guess it would be interesting to look up on the internet. By the way, these Platonians are another example of aliens visiting Earth in ancient times, much like Apollo and his brood from the ""Who Mourns For Adonais?"" episode; it seems a common occurrence in the Trek universe. This also benefited from the guest star turn by actor Dunn, better known for his mesmerizing portrayal of the villainous Loveless on the ""Wild Wild West"" TV series.",7
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Plato's Stepchildren (TV Episode 1968)","""Where I come from, size, shape, or color makes no difference"".","Well you have to admit, Star Trek came up with some pretty goofy stuff from time to time. Kirk and Spock have a Monty Python moment in this episode with their Tweedledum routine, and there's even a scene where Spock laughs because, let's face it, he probably couldn't keep a straight face with some of the nonsense going on.It's too bad the message of the story didn't stand out more than the quote in my summary line might have suggested. The best scenes had to do with Kirk's uplifting dialog with Alexander (Michael Dunn), providing him with inspiration and hope even as the little guy kept getting tortured by Parmen's (Liam Sullivan) mental blasts. For a society bred toward contemplation, self-reliance and longevity, the Platonians certainly didn't apply any humanity to their world view.And taking the 'color makes no difference' angle a step further, the Captain plants one on Uhura in TV's first inter-racial kiss. I know everyone else on this board has mentioned it already, but this really WAS a big deal. A year later, ex-footballer Jim Brown had a big screen inter-racial match up with Raquel Welch in ""100 Rifles"", and though I'm not sure if that was the first movie instance of black and white lovers, it had to be close. So once again, Star Trek broke new ground, going where no man (or woman) had gone before.",7

However, these bizarre and impossible situations made the visit to aliens who act like they are the descendent's of the ancient Athenians not so impossible to take after all! Sure, it's all completely silly, but somehow the execution is good enough to keep the episode from being dumb. In fact, since these Platonians are also super-powerful, it's pretty cool to see them abuse their power and torture not only their pet dwarf, but the crew members. While stating that they are enlightened and honorable, the Greek Freaks are really just petty little jerks who love pushing around weaker people. Well, despite their hubris, in the end, Kirk is able to defeat them and watch these pansies beg for mercy.Interestingly enough, aside from being a pretty good episode, this show has the distinction of having the first American televised interracial kiss between cast members of a series, as Kirk kisses Uhura passionately on the mouth.

While I had seen the show as a child on it's first run, this was the first episode I watched as an adult. It had the bonus of involving telekinesis (or psychokinesis as it was called in the episode), something I find fascinating within the realm of fiction.There is no question that the story has heaping logical flaws. These Platonians have lived a few thousand years so they must have a tremendous resistance to disease as well as longevity but a mere cut infects Parmen badly just from sitting around all the time. But once Dr. McCoy helps him, the doctor comments upon Parmen's amazing recuperative powers. Then there are problems such as the Platonians had apparently visited Earth during Plato's era or shortly thereafter and then left but he forces Kirk and Spock to quote Lewis Carroll. And he knows about this how? The episode falls into a typical Trek pattern as the telekinesis of the Platonians seems without limits although in this case, the heroes can give themselves the same abilities as the seemingly all-powerful aliens, which is an unusual twist.One comment I've heard throughout the years is, ""Since Kirk stated they could recreate the power at will now that they know how, why haven't they pulled it out of mothballs to stomp the Borg and others easily when they were attacked?"" This is just one of those situations where you have to take each episode as a self-contained reality having no bearing on future stories. That would be far less likely to work these days. If you like, Kirk was wrong. It can only be simulated for a short time and only using materials on Platonius.The acting is unusually good in this one. Even Shatner's acting is good considering the humiliating situations. Liam Sullivan as Parmen is the heart of aristocratic evil and desperate need for anything to keep him going. Barbara Babcock as Philana beautifully portrays the desire to feel and, so I got the impression, to participate rather than just watch feelings. Michael Dunn, whose portrayal of Dr. Miquelito Loveless in ""The Wild Wild West"" was superb here takes a character who has to spout a lot of exposition and makes him the most sympathetic character.It's hard to buy into the idea that it's their longevity and power that has ""made them crazy"" since Alexander says he was brought there as the court buffoon to begin with, that they already had a smug, class divided society and that they started really pushing him around the day they got the powers.It was a tribute to the philosophy of Star Trek though that, once they triumphed, Kirk tossed revenge out the window as did Spock.I found the sets to be bright and highly attractive, perhaps the more so because there was a certain stage set unreality to them. I think I found the power fascinating as well because it had to be acted rather than accomplished by CGI.One note is that the ""First interracial kiss on television"" thing is a long debunked fallacy. The first interracial kiss was almost any episode of ""I Love Lucy"". If specifically black and white is meant, there was previously a variety show where a black and white person kissed. Only if one means specifically fiction on television between two characters who are one black and one white does it become the first interracial kiss and even then, it is clearly filmed in such a way that one cannot tell whether they are really kissing or not. Even if they are, we cannot see it- unlike the undeniable and prolonged kiss between Spock and Chapel. So it will always be argued whether it was or was not the first interracial kiss or a kiss at all.The episode is uncomfortable to watch but what I think a lot of people miss is that this is because the raw emotion and display of the negatives in human nature make it uncomfortable. Sure, Kirk on all fours neighing like a horse seems funny from one point of view and yet in the sequel to ""Roots"", we have the LeVar Burton (ironically, a Star Trek connection) character on all fours neighing like a horse and being ridden by children while staring at someone with a look in his eyes that says how degrading and dehumanizing this is. I suppose by trying to make the same point but doing it with aliens in a fantastic setting, it's hard for the audience to get by the window dressing and recognize the same theme and situation. This is about the lowest levels of degradation that humans can sink to, not just the victims but more so the perpetrators.There are those who rate it as the worst original Trek episode but it is probably my second favorite next to ""The Empath"", yet another episode rated low by many people but which cuts to the very essence of what Star Trek is which, in my opinion, is about admitting what we have inside us, the depths we can sink to but making a choice and rising to the highest levels we are capable of.",
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Plato's Stepchildren (TV Episode 1968)","Again, sometimes wrongfully dismissed.","There's a theory in psychology that if you press a person's buttons that you'll get to the heart of the matter regarding whatever it is that's bothering them, and hence be able ""to cure them"" of whatever emotional ailment is believed to be afflicting them.What does this mean? It means torture. Not in the physical sense, but in the grade school sense where one is taunted and teased to the point of breaking. Any parent will tell you that the solution is a good spanking, slap across the cheek, or a ""time out"" where said problem child is placed in a corner, and not allowed to speak to anyone or interact with anything.Now, what if you were an adult and experienced this? Your normal reaction would be to retort back or ignore the matter, until you couldn't take it anymore. So it is with Plato's Stepchildren, as we see a typical luring of the afflicted represented by Kirk, Spock and McCoy ""to treat"" the psychiatric-needful and physiologically distraught Parman, a man who models himself and his society after one of Plato's utopias (down to the slave class).Like unexpectant, hapless, unworried patients approaching a ""facility"" they, the U.S.S. Enterprise's trio representing the ship's command of heart and mind, are lured to do bidding they have not foreseen.The allegorical doctor is Parman. This script, like much of Roddenberry's fare, is taken right out of case examples of Psychology Today, where the patient is mentally tortured for ""a cure"". Nevermind the fact that this defies all principles of civilized nations, which seems to be the point that Kirk and Spock make after the display of debauchery they are forced to exemplify for a lurid audience who might as well be peep-show addicts down at the local porn shop. So it is the message of the author of this episode to the world of alleged mental health, and their snake-oil filled shelves of cures. The audience at the end of the episode are, in fact, psychologists represented allegorically.Does a civilized nation of any sort, burden itself with such a pyramidal scheme of political power the likes of which are invested in Parman? The forcing of affections, the creation of a display against one's will, the violation of basic decency on the part of the subjects in question, in this case Captain James T. Kirk and Executive Officer Mister Spock, may seem like child's play to the child like mind, but it is serious business with men and women of pride and a code of conduct are concerned.Would you like to be Kirk or Spock in this episode? Take care for your answer, because it does happen.It is not until the balance of power is brought back that a sense of reciprocity is forthcoming. More than justice, but not quite revenge. Is this how things work in the real world from which the allegory is drawn? No.What we're witnessing are school yard tactics which are often employed and labeled as ""office politics"" in the workplace. Either way it's unwarranted, and, if taken too far, libel to be the subject of arrest and a law suit for those involved in executing ""the treatment"".Thankfully this is fiction. And not just fiction, but Science Fiction, and one of our favorites; 1960's era Star Trek :-)The down-shot of this Trek installment is of course once more that it's another 3rd season low budget episode. Or, at lest low budget by Star Trek standards. No red shirts were hurt in the filming of this episode (thank goodness), and the musical accompaniment is narrow in scope as opposed to the relatively adventurous and grand orchestrations by the great Alexander Courage.We have to ignore things like why doesn't the ship and crew just do Action-X or execute Plan-Y? Well, it's taken care of in the script as best as possible, but it does give one a moment of pause. But again, the episode's thrust is the indolent seeker of power to tamper with a thing that doesn't need tampering. I wonder if Plato would approve.Note; interracial kiss; unfortunately Shatner denied it, then embraced it, then denied it once more according some involved. Looking at it in retrospect it's a silly thing. Men and women, whoever they are, should be allowed to feel and express affection for one another. Unless of course you're the actor involved, and you think your career might be damaged by it. Again, fortunately this is Trek, and know that the social taboos of yesteryear are just that; gone.",
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Plato's Stepchildren (TV Episode 1968)",Absolute Power,"Again a reference to earth culture in a Star Trek episode for a reference point for viewers. Some travelers in space who at one time settled in ancient Greece and admired the culture have now settled on a planet and have developed their minds kind of like the Krells had done in Forbidden Planet. Only their monster from the ID is nothing like a pretend creature from the depths of their souls.They've developed their minds and psychokinetic abilities to such a degree that they make everyone else dance to their tune. Such is what they do for amusement to several Enterprise crew members. They do have a purpose in mind. They're a finely tuned genetic machine these Platonians, but having achieved almost immortality and eradicating those pesty one celled things that cause disease they're immune systems are non-existent. When DeForest Kelley treats the head Platonian Liam Sullivan for a simple cut that has grown infected, Sullivan decides a Platonian doctor on call is what the planet lacks.Sullivan is also willing to go any lengths to keep Dr. McCoy there at his beck and call. And of course making the Enterprise crew do what you want them to do is good amusement. Previously the only one whom they could do it to was dwarf Michael Dunn.An interesting parable about absolute power. This Star Trek episode should be seen back to back with Forbidden Planet.",6
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Plato's Stepchildren (TV Episode 1968)",What Did I Just Watch?,"""Plato's Stepchildren"" has to be one of the oddest entries in the show's run. Drawn to an uninhabited planet by a distress call, Bones is asked to save an alien race's leader from a deadly infection. The people here are telekinetic and prior visitors of Earth. They left their planet after its sun when nova and they visited Earth for a time. They became infatuated with Greek culture and based their own planet off of it. Their powers have allowed them to live here for centuries undetected. After saving the leader's life, they ask Bones to stay and be their doctor. He quickly declines but they won't take no for an answer, even if that means torturing his friends in the process. We see Kirk continuously punching himself in the face, Spock almost crushing Kirk's skull with his foot, and all sorts of bizarre interactions and movements.Bones is able to isolate why this planet gave the people these powers. He creates a concoction in Kirk's blood that allows him to battle the leader telekinetically. Kirk wins and warns the people to be better behaved or the Federation will come down and give them a shiner in the future.I'm not sure whether it was Gene or just a fad of the times but there is an absurd about of Greek content in TOS. ""Who Mourns for Adonais?"" and this are two entire episodes based around its culture. (I wonder if the two alien races ever met while on Earth or were aware of other alien life forms there?) Anyways, I'm not a big fan of either of those episodes. Both revolve around the concept that more advanced alien species would end up on Earth and become so infatuated with these lesser beings that they would base their entire culture and lives around the Greeks. It's a bizarre concept.The physical acting in this episode is absolutely insane. Kirk's strange gyrations and tics, Spock's emotional outlet and song & dance, it all felt like I had stumbled across something that I wasn't intended to see.Even so, I couldn't take my eyes off of it (I believe the old adage is ""like a car crash in slow motion). Is it good? No. Is it bad? I don't know... But it is a peculiarity worth investigating.",5
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Plato's Stepchildren (TV Episode 1968)",Humiliated by Platonians,"Having responded to a distress signal from an unknown planet Kirk, Spock and McCoy are greeted by a dwarf named Alexander who takes them to the society's leader Parmen who is threaten by an infected cut. After McCoy treats him the away team learn that this society, the Platonians, is based on the Ancient Greek society which they visited before it fell. They then moved to their current home where a eugenics programme led to a tiny population which is effectively immortal and everybody apart from Alexander has telekinetic powers. They say that this incident shows that they need a physician so they insist that McCoy stays with them. When he refuses they use their powers to humiliate Kirk and Spock; treating them like puppets. McCoy manages to discover the source of the Platonian's power and replicate it but he is unsure how long it will take to work. Before it can start working the Platonians have force Uhuru and Nurse Chapel to beam down and join in their cruel puppet show.This is one of the best known episodes of Star Trek thanks to the inter-racial kiss between Kirk and Uhuru; thankfully anybody watching know would hardly think twice about the characters different races. That doesn't mean it isn't a rather disturbing scene because the characters are being forced to act against their will; there is a sadistic side to Platonians in general and Parmen in particular and the way he deliberately humiliates Kirk, Spock and later Uhuru and Chapel makes for some uncomfortable viewing. The cast do solid job with guest stars Michael Dunn being likable as Alexander and Liam Sullivan being suitably unlikable as Parman. The story itself is entertaining enough although we have had enough of societies that either mirror or are based on historical Earth societies it might have been better had these characters just been aliens without all the Grecian trappings. Overall a solid enough episode but not as good as it could have been.",7
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Plato's Stepchildren (TV Episode 1968)",Humiliation not to be taken lightly,"In response to the reviewers who ridiculed this episode for being ridiculous, the entire point of the crews ""performances"" was to humiliate them while providing entertainment to the Platonians. And one must remember when watching TV shows/movies that pre-date the 1970's, that you must read between the lines that are allowed to slip past the censors. The scenes between the male/female members of the Enterprise crew would be equivalent to an actual explicit S&M orgy. They would seem funny and lightweight to generations today who are used to seeing gratuitous violence and sex played out before them.As others have said here, Star Trek was leaps and bounds ahead of its time and, frankly, I'm amazed at how much they were able to ""get away"" with throughout the series. Even the line from this episode that ""where I come from people are not judged by the color of their skin...or size"" would have caused an outrage in some people during the time who did not believe that all people are equal. Thank goodness for the famous interracial kiss to keep the bigots distracted from protesting that ""inflammatory"" statement.",10

The show goes too far and shows the aliens deriving sadistic pleasure from forcing Kirk to kiss and then whip Uhura, and Spock does the same to Nurse Chapel. I am amazed that this episode was even allowed to air on 1960's television. Sadism has no place in entertainment, even if it's the bad guys doing it. You keep watching thinking that Kirk will take control before things get too bad, but he doesn't until the very end and things just keep getting worse. This episode is demeaning to the characters as well as the actors that had to go through with it, and should have been rejected by the production crew.",1

I remember seeing PS as a 7 year-old, and back then I considered it quite disturbing, an abomination of an episode. However, many years later I find myself laughing out loud at Kirk & Co., who mime their way through the silliest ST episode - even goofier than ""That Which Survives"". The absolute highlight is the first time Kirk, McCoy and Spock are dragged through a door: SCREAMINGLY funny. The less said about Spock and Kirk dancing/singing like kids, the better...Spock: ""Plato wanted truth, beauty, and above all justice"". Actually, if you ever read the ""deep thoughts"" of this arrogant, deluded, boy-fondling Ancient Greek, you'll find that much of it is deranged, and not much less silly than this ST episode.Visually, PS is perhaps the best-looking episode: great 60s glam-o-rama colours and nice sets. Otherwise, along with ""Dagger Of The Mind"", it is known as one of the more sadistic entries, and notoriously campy, with the crew being made to look more foolish than ever. Even the Marx Brothers never had to go this far. Chaplin must have been envious.SCOTTY: ""Captain, I hear you were made to slap yourself repeatedly in the face.

Shatner: ""Don't ask... I had to bray like a donkey, while a dwarf rode me... Whatever you do, don't EVER go into acting!"" One of them did, though. Perhaps she failed to watch PS... This episode should serve as a dire warning to any aspiring thespians about what can happen in the supposedly glamorous world of acting.Strangely enough, PS has a small amount of good-quality, intelligent dialogue amidst all the lunacy.SCOTTY: ""Captain, I hear you got to kiss Lt. Uhura! I take back what I said earlier: when can I beam down, too?"" If there ever was an attempt to destroy Spock's cold/logical image, it was in PS. Worse yet for Nimoy, he was forced to touch and feel up Majel, whose hands almost single-handedly (no pun intended) covered the entire screen in one shot. Brrrr! It was also absolutely amazing to me that the Plutonians get away with less than a slap on the wrist! Kirk basically tells them ""never to do that again, d'ya hear?"", they nod, and that's it! Starfleet's absurdly impractical pacifism never did sit too well with me... However, it's an ending that should please any liberals watching it. ""Give peace a chance""...",

Of course, like so many advanced civilizations in the original series, here we go again with their shortsightedness and their need to do evil instead of something positive with their powers. Kirk and the gang land on a planet that was every stereotype of ancient Roman culture we can come up with. The people have mastered telekinesis and use it to make the Enterprise crew look like fools, making them dance and do things utterly embarrassing to them. The whole coliseum full are smarmy, useless creatures who get their jollies from watching pain. Alexander is the gofer for them, ridiculed because he is a little person.

The Platonians have selective breeding and a type of eugenics that left their number paired down to 38. The planet is rich in ""kironide"" mineral deposits which gives them their psionic abilities, all except for a friendly dwarf named Alexander. Alexander is their court jester and a slave to the Platonians - he is forced by the psionic abilities to do their bidding. McCoy, Kirk and Spock all beam down. McCoy gives Parmen the medical treatment he needs and decides to keep McCoy. They have not needed the medical arts before the time that Parmen became ill.

I actually like this one - it's not the greatest of episodes but it does bring out emotions in me which has me really enjoying it... even though Mr. Spock might find that illogical. LOL. ;) The famous kiss - erroneously called the first scripted interracial kiss on television. Forcing Kirk to the ground, having Spock to dance and almost crush Kirk's face with his foot, forcing Spock to laugh and then to cry (McCoy saying it will destroy Spock - meaning killing Spock to me).

The planet itself has properties that have provided the alien residents with telekinetic power that can force those without it to do their so desire. The planet had minerals and soil content the Federation found desirable not realizing the Platonians were living on it. Parmen (Liam Sullivan) and wife, Philana (Barbara Babcock), along with 38 other smug, loathsome, detestable Platonians toy around with dwarf humanoid, Alexander (the wonderful Michael Dunn), using his as a ""buffoon"" for entertainment purposes, disrespecting and humiliating Kirk and Spock when McCoy refuses to stay behind on their planet as their personal medical doctor (Parmen nearly dies from a simple cut, resulting in a serious infection that McCoy helps to heal, his recuperative power helping also). Such despicable acts include Kirk being forced to slap his face over and over, Kirk and Spock having to sing from ""Through the Looking Glass"", Kirk forced to all fours while Alexander rides him like a donkey, and Spock's emotions infiltrated to where he must cry and laugh. While Uhura and Nurse Chapel are forced to beam down and kiss Kirk and Spock respectively (resulting in one interracial kiss quite celebrated and the other an interspecies kiss that is often overlooked), I think the best scene is actually Kirk, McCoy, and Spock dealing with the humiliation and embarrassment of what Parmen done to himSpock admits, like McCoy, of the hatred that fills them, while Kirk endures the physical toll the actions of Parmen took on him. Alexander is the ultimate victim, having endured the Platonian cruelty for far too long, seeing past his own disgust and rage thanks to Kirk who fights against the desire for revenge in favor of securing the same power Parmen and his aliens currently have so he can combat their efforts to bend him and Spock to their will. I think that when Kirk and Spock refuse to kill Parmen or even inflict a little payback to the others when the duo are hypo-injected with double the nutrients that give them extra telekinetic power is a testament to the maturity of Roddenberry's vision of mankind in the future. The kiss between Shatner and Nichelle Nichols gets a great deal of the recognition, but I think we must not discount the message regarding man's cruelty through power towards those powerless to stop him/them. And we see that those in power who do treat those disenfranchised with cruelty eventually fall.

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. The series didn't seem to mature as it should have but definitely has improved on terms of implementing smarter approach, parallel plot lines and thought provoking concept.Season 03Contrary to expectations, second season failed to project the essential character development which would have give a perfect arc to the series and instead focused on different cases. In this final season the expectations are still higher as they have somehow glued their audience with their gripping screenplay and innovative imagination that doesn't flinch on pushing the boundaries.Plato's StepchildrenThe physical sequences are way too much which suggests that they didn't have enough material to offer and neither was it working as the writers anticipated.

These aliens hail from a planet where volcanic upheavals and radiation have accelerated them - make that 'hyper-accelerated' - to the point where they move too quickly for normal humans to see them. It's almost like they're stuck in another dimension (another level) and the concept is similar to the ""Flash"" comic book character, who moves so quickly at times that everything else appears to be frozen still. There are obvious discrepancies in the way the concept is presented here: though all Scalosians supposedly move at a pace of 100 times that of normal, they go through the same amount of experience in this episode as the normal-moving crew; the crew get just as much done as the invaders during the course of the episode. For example, the Scalosians should have completed their invasion plan in the time it took for Spock to head down to McCoy's medical lab in mid-episode. Right after Kirk is accelerated on the bridge, he heads for the turbolift, but that mode of transport would now take him an eternity; though it isn't mentioned, he must have used the stairs, er, ladders. This seems to be some careless scriptwriting. However, maybe the Scalosians were using the turbolifts in ignorance and this slowed them down enough for the discrepancies to make sense.Despite a surprisingly slow pace in spots even though this is such an, uh, accelerated episode (we see video tapes of the Scalosians over & over), this comes off as fairly entertaining due to Kirk's odd conflicting attraction with the leader of the invaders, princess Deela, played by actress Kathie Browne like some naughty valley girl from outer space. It's amusing to see Kirk allow himself a very brief lecherous smirk when he first sees her, even as he knows he's in the middle of a hostile invasion. Here's where Kirk's rep as the super-stud of Trek space may have gained the most traction, ahem. There's even a scene of him putting his boots back on after he and the foxy invader have obviously done the nasty deed (since this is the sixties, all other TV episodes on this show never went beyond subtle suggestion, say, a veiled wink or two; by contrast, this scene was very direct). He and Deela obviously felt a genuine sexual heat, much more apparent and honest than the usual family-oriented titillation. In fact, the entire plot of the episode revolves around the theme of survival based on necessary procreation - mating for the sake of a species, but also seeking as much enjoyment as possible in the act. This is almost an episode for grown-ups only. Almost. But, the outfits on the male Scalosians were a bit too kinky for my tastes.",7
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Wink of an Eye (TV Episode 1968)",Don't drink the Scalosian water before bed.,"Star Trek always had what I called the ""Macy's Parade"" approach to working within a budget--especially in season three. Matte paintings, props,sets, visual effects shots, all were fair game for the producers to utilize, repaint and reconfigure to save money. They must have thought viewers had short memories. Not ""Trek"" fans. With that said, this episode did a great job of pulling off a lot with the barest of essentials. The Enterprise's landing party transports down to the planet's surface to find a deserted city. This is odd because they were recently sent a distress signal by the inhabitants of this world. A crew member, planet-side, stupidly, takes a drink from a cascading water fountain and disappears. Kirk and the others hear (but don't see) buzzing insects. They are, needless to say, a little perplexed by this turn of events. They scurry back to the ship. On the bridge, Kirk drinks a cup of coffee and he too disappears. The Scalosians, you see, have been able to accelerate themselves into a state of hyper-space. Their motives are not good--it's a trap. I wonder if one of the ideas for this wacky story, may have sprung from a movie titled ""The Time Travelers,"" and it's low-budget remake, ""Journey to the Center of Time."" Something to keep in mind when you watch this episode, one of the best from Star Trek's final season. Space trivia alert: Kathie Browne, Kirk's love interest in this story and female leader of the Scalosians, was married to the ""Night Stalker"" himself, Darren McGavin.

It makes for an interesting give and take between the effort of the Scalosians to take over the Enterprise, and the crew led by Spock and McCoy to save the ship and get the Captain back.I was amused by the name of the red-shirt character who disappeared first while on Scalos. In the 1969 movie ""Joe"", Peter Boyle's character utters the line ""It's your ass now Compton"" when his businessman friend gets himself jammed up in that story. Somehow it seemed utterly appropriate here.And sure, how can I let it go by that this episode played the viewer for a gut level response to the Captain fixing his boot at the edge of the bed with Deela (Kathie Brown) standing nearby. There did seem to be a chemistry between the two that was much more evident than any of Kirk's past associations except maybe Natira (#3.8 - For the World is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky), Miramanee (#3.3 - The Paradise Syndrome), or Ruth (#1.15 - Shore Leave). On second thought, never mind.The solution to the Enterprise predicament was handled quite cleverly I thought, with the Captain's secretive switch with the computer tape. Unable to communicate verbally with his crew, you took it pretty much at Deela's word that Kirk was good and stuck where he was. Kudos to the writers for coming up with a novel save that required some ingenuity instead of some manufactured fight to the finish between the good guys and the bad guys.",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Wink of an Eye (TV Episode 1968)",Cheerful and original.,"One of the very best ST episodes, partly because it offers a real sci-fi premise and not some run-of-the-mill by-the-numbers plot that is so standard it could be used for almost any non-sci-fi TV show. While somewhat similar to ""By Any Other Name"" (which is one of the worst episodes), the overtaking-of-the-ship shtick is almost devoid of the usual clichés and cheap plot-devices. Kirk's love-interest is played by a charismatic actress who does the role with perfect tongue-in-cheek cheerfulness. The chemistry between Browne and Shatner is very effective, offering a totally different kind of relationship than the other, more standard conquests Kirk has; there is far more humour in it and it looks genuine.I don't even see any glaring logic problems. A minor point would be that the events in ""Spock/McCoy time"" were sufficiently long as to imply that Kirk must have spent weeks, if not months, in accelerated time, yet there isn't much evidence that the aliens needed so much time to prepare the Enterprise for freezing. As for annoyances, the only irritating aspect was yet another red-shirt crew member showing an absurd lack of discipline, loyalty and morale, by very quickly taking the side of the enemy - much like the red-shirt gal in the very mediocre ""Space Seed"" episode. (Those damn red-shirts... either they betray you or they die on you!) Since there was zero explanation as to why ""they soon come around to it"", I can't accept that idea that acceleration makes humans docile. It certainly had no effect on Kirk, who is supposed to be human, the last time I checked.Some of the episode's scenes were shot at a tilted angle, something that would be later used ad nauseum in the wonderfully silly ""Battlefield Earth"".",
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Wink of an Eye (TV Episode 1968)",A Creative Idea,"This is a case of clashing cultures caught in conflicting time accelerations. After a visit to a barren planet, people begin to disappear on board the enterprise. Kirk and one of the unfortunate red shirted crewman have been moved to a ship where time is passing at an alarming rate. This is with coffee that's not on Starbuck's menu. A small group of aliens wearing shiny Mylar suits (well, I take that back. The women wear almost nothing) are on the brink of extinction and must bring people from a different time designation to mate with. Kirk, of course, gets the queen of the whole bunch. She likes him because he is a ""pretty"" one. She is quite sexy and doe eyed. Because they don't fear Kirk, he is allowed access to the ship. This is a mistake because he is nothing but trouble. There is also jealousy at work on the ship. Kirk's mission is to get a message to the crew who are moving at an indecipherably slow speed. This is a good concept. It comes up short but is engaging enough to keep one's attention.",7
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Wink of an Eye (TV Episode 1968)",Life in the fast lane!,"When the crew of the Enterprise respond to a distress call from the planet Scalos they find no sign of anybody despite beaming down in what appears to be a modern city; the only sign of life is the annoying buzz of a fly. As they investigate a red-shirt suddenly vanishes! With no idea what happened the rest of the team return to the Enterprise and soon after systems start failing then a strange device suddenly appears on the life support system; what is more that fly appears to have beamed back with them. Kirk drinks a cup of coffee then something strange starts to happen; those around him appear to be slowing down then suddenly a scantily clad blonde, Deela, appears in front of him and kisses him! It turns out she is one of the last Scalosians left; they are a species that lives at a much faster pace than other species but they are dying out and can only breed by luring suitable humanoids to their planet and 'accelerating' selected ones (in Kirk's case by spiking his coffee). They plan to take Kirk back to the planet and freeze the rest of the crew for later use. Meanwhile back in 'normal time' Spock figures out what has happened and replicates the Scalosian accelerating agent as well as a theoretical cure; he just has to hope he can use it before it is too late.This is an enjoyable episode with some great ideas; it also requires the viewer to not think about things too deeply or plot holes appear. Moving as fast as they do the Scalosians should be able to compete their plans almost as soon as the crew notice the captain has gone but the crew not only notice but manage to do rather a lot while the Scalosians are making their modifications and there is no suggestion that a lot more time has passed for Kirk and the Scalosians than the rest of the crew. If you can ignore these details there is a lot of fun to be had; yet again Kirk ends up in the arms of a beautiful human-looking alien and there is a sense of danger we see that the slightest injury to an accelerated person leads to rapid ageing and death Deela may be interesting in Kirk but fellow Scalosian Rael is violently jealous. Overall another decent episode despite a few flaws.",7
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Wink of an Eye (TV Episode 1968)",An interesting concept--one that is very unique,"The Enterprise receives a distress signal, but when they arrived on the planet, they see it was once inhabited but is now totally depopulated. When they transport back to the ship, something is slipped in Kirk's coffee by an unseen force. Suddenly, everyone but him appears to be moving slower and slower, though it's actually Kirk that is accelerating in speed to such a degree that he seems to disappear--moving too fast for the human eye to detect. Once this occurs, he discovers that there were survivors on the planet and they beamed aboard undetected because they, too, were moving at this hugely accelerated speed. These humanoids plan on putting the ship's crew in suspended animation and using the crew as breeding stock to be thawed out as needed, as the same thing that makes these being accelerate also makes their men shoot blanks, so to speak! The shear originality of the script make this a very memorable episode. While not among the very best, it is well worth seeing and you'll once again see an alien hottie fall for the super-studly Captain.",8
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Wink of an Eye (TV Episode 1968)","Great Season Three Episode, But Questions Begin","For season three this is one of my favorites, it also ranks high for the entire TOS run in my book. Kirk shooting the phaser after accelerating remains a vivid memory from my childhood, I just thought that was so cool. Only real criticisms I can think of are the ending, was Kirk that po'd that he just left them there? Where is the branching out the Federation of Planets stuff? At least tell them your going to send back a diplomatic ship to work on a resolution. And why didn't they offer them the antidote that McCoy made? Another criticism I have is Trek TOS encountered all these different alien races for exploration reasons but I never see them adopting any of the stuff they find other than in that episode, never later on. Case in point that Scolosian water accelerates and McCoy has an antidote to counteract it. Wouldn't it have been cool for the Enterprise to be in a hopeless situation in another episode and surrounded by alien ships (take your pick), so Kirk beams Spock on board the alien ship after he takes the acceleration water, Spock disables all the ships and beams back, no problem! Well I guess you can't beam with shields up, so it would have to be another situation, but that acceleration water could have come in handy. Anyway, meeting all those aliens I could see some of the humans learning stuff like levitation and the ability to fly, it would have made things ""fascinating"".

It's got a science fiction premise (""acceleration"") but the mood and tone is that of a classic fairy tale or Greek myth. Enchanting, golden-haired Deela (short for Delilah?) is a real archetype -- the doomed temptress who lures great heroes to her bed for an eternity of love, only to exact a terrible price in slavery and loss of self-respect. Ironically, this is one of the most ""timeless"" Star Trek episodes, precisely because it's not based on technology or social issues, but on myths, dreams, and memories. Kirk's can-do spirit is admirable, but in the end he can't find a solution for Deela or her people, and he has no answer to her tearful image at the end, except to say ""Good-bye.""",8
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Wink of an Eye (TV Episode 1968)","The Enterprise ""goes fast""","The Voyager Episode ""Blink of an Eye"" has a similar premise - People living so fast you can't see em. Kind of like my neighbors (EX neighbors).What was in The Scalosian Water, a super concentrated version of ""That stuff that keeps you awake for a long time""?Whatever it was, it really makes people go fast! In fact, when the ""Landing Party"" gets down there, Kirk thinks there are bugs flying around. Bugs that apparently talked all the time, to make that noise. Kirk finds out later, the Queen Scalosian ""Deela"" (Kathie Brown) was smooching him without his consent.So, these parasites get Beamed up with The Landing party and immediately take over, changing the Enterprise into a huge refrigerator, so they can get ""Take Out"" food. Oops, would not the Transporter Chief see a sudden increase in MASS on the Transporter Pad, and the outlines of unknown people being beamed up? I dunno, I suspend a LOT of disbelief for some of these episodes. It's because I dug Bill Theiss' great costumes for these chicks, and none of those costumes ever cost more than a buck in material costs, so to say they are 'Skimpy' is an understatement of mass proportions.It's actually because of the Scalosian Chicks, who can't get knocked up with their own men, so they have to kidnap unsuspecting spaceships passing by, pick a few choice morsels and freeze the rest, have several orgies, and then unfreeze more men. What do they do about the Women? Uhura would have been SOOL.I just wanna say that, these people would have been dead after the first 10 minutes of real time on The Enterprise. Unless maybe they have a lifespan of several hundred years in comparative Earth-Time.One thing they got relatively accurate is the DAMAGING EFFECT of substances that ""stimulate"" you - One guy dies of a mere scratch. So, as far as ""Fair Warning"" goes about abusing these kinds of things, this is a good horror story for that, an exaggeration, but true nevertheless.If you think about this, how can you fight this kind of thing, being attacked by people who live at a different speed than you? It's utterly impossible, you have to fight them on their own level, which Spock does and he can do this because he himself has a very long life span.The whole thing is so unbelievable that I loved it anyway.

Of course ""Deela"" is also a ""knock out"" with big blonde hair. She is also very well-endowed, or at least her skimpy costume is. Our oversexed Capt. Kirk probably ""scored"", as usual. The hyperactive aliens use ""inferior"" beings to repopulate, as all their men are sterile. That's a big plot-hole: It can't be working too well if they are down to 5 people! (There should have been more ""extras"".) A well-paced episode with an otherwise good premise. All the action takes place on The Enterprise, which the aliens intend to turn into a big suspended animation ""meat locker"" to store the frozen crew as they need them. Spook and Dr. McCoy manage to save-the-day and rescue our poor Captain before he is ""burned out"" from cell damage and lovemaking.

11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Wink of an Eye (TV Episode 1968)",What would you do if you could accelerate you internal sense of time?,"I found the underlying plot device of this episode intriguing and well performed. The Scalosians live in a state where time is greatly accelerated compared to those around them. This enables them to become virtually invisible and accomplish many things in a short time span. I found this possibility intriguing. What would you do if you lived at a faster rate than those around you? The Scalosians accelerate Kirk into their time state so that he can come live with them and help propagate the race. Kirk and Spock are physically in the same room, but it is as if they are stuck in different universes. Kirk sees Spock as virtually frozen in time he is going so slow, and Spock experiences Kirk only as a waft of air and a buzzing sound because he is moving about so quickly. Kirk must figure out a way to communicate with Spock so that they can defeat the Scalosians. He cleverly thinks up to record a computer message and have Spock play it back at low speed. He could have just as well written a message on paper, but I guess there's no paper around in their century. The other thing is that Kirk wasn't really invisible, he was just going too fast for Spock to see. If he just sat motionless for a few minutes in front of Spock, Spock would have seen him just fine. But I guess such an approach does not make for very exciting television. Oddly, despite the crew's time running one hundred times slower than the Scalosians, they still manage to accomplish just as much.The only thing I didn't like about episode was the trashy prostitute-like head Scalosian female and her trashy relationship with Kirk. She kept throwing herself at Kirk, and he eventually gave in and played along. Some people like this kind of thing in a TV show, but I find it just cheapens everything. Somehow Kirk has the discipline to be captain of the military's flagship, but he doesn't have the discipline to keep his lips off every girl he meets. Riiight.It would have been interesting to see Kirk use this time acceleration trick in future episodes to thwart his opponents now that he has mastered it. Sadly, such in not possible in non-arcing episodic television.",7

When he was at normal speed the Scalosians whom he now sees and interacts with sounded like buzzing insects. There are only five Scalosians left, Jason Evers, Kathie Browne and three others. And there is crewman Geoffrey Binney as well, but he dies from a little too much accelerated living.The Scalosians are quite frank as to their intentions as they don't think that Shatner can do anything.

relationship between Kirk and Deela; and that Kathie Browne is a total knockout!
I wonder if others have noticed a similarity between this series and Wild, Wild West? (1965-69). Both had good-looking leading men, and often had a beautiful woman who was a romantic interest for the hero. I imagine that for an actress in the 1960's, it was especially fun to be cast as one of these sci-fi women guest stars of Star Trek. Partly because the costumes were colorful, memorable and often very sexy! For a number of actresses, that was the one role for which they are most remembered--those were really showcase roles. Kathie Browne was one of the great beauties on the show, and also one of the best actresses.
Here's the plot problem: Why, for heaven's sake, did Kirk not offer the Scalosians the antidote that he and Spock took? Would it not have worked because they would still be on the planet, drinking the water? Or would it be interference with their almost-extinct society? I would have offered them the antidote!",10

Like many S3 episodes, the scope is small thanks to reduced budgets, but where the season's better episodes used this to their advantage, focusing on stronger, more personal stories, ""Wink of an Eye"" is merely unambitious.

Malfunctioning to the Enterprise and a buzzing sound clue the crew in on a presence they are unable to see (radiation from volcanic eruptions caused the life on Scalos to become exponentially accelerated to such a degree where humans/other beings can't see them, with their talk sped up to the sound of bee buzzing!). Scalos water causes Kirk to be ""hyperaccelerated"" as well, with him meeting the pretty Scalosian, Deela (Kathie Brown), who is provocatively dressed in a revealing attire, with an infectious smile and charm. Kirk is enchanted by her although he has no plans of being her sperm donor...yes, the radiation also caused sterility.

Jason Evers is Rael, Scalosian also on board the Enterprise, a rival of Kirk's ultimately because he loves Deela. The transporter trickery Kirk causes helps buy him some time. A taped recording to Spock regarding Scalosian plans could help his cause.The science and plot logic are dubious at best. The methods used by Scalosians, and how they operate on the Enterprise don't hold under scrutiny. The accelerated alien repropagation project made me chuckle a bit. Kirk unable to avoid a little lovin' and capitalizing on Deela's attraction to him is fun because Shatner and Brown have good chemistry...his stubborn unwillingness to accept his fate as the Scalosians have decided makes him even more appealing to Deela.

They have modified the Enterprise to make it livable for them. Kirk must figure out how to get back to his own time duration and get these aliens of the ship. Spock and Bones must figure out how to counteract the potion.This episode is an example of a really cool idea that was poorly executed. The writers definitely didn't think this one through. The crew of the Enterprise are able to accomplish wayyyyy too much in the allotted time. These Scalosians are suppose to be so much faster than the humans that Spock and Bones shouldn't have had nearly enough time to foil the Scalosian plan.

Definitely not the best of Season 3 but there are definitely worse ones!",6
22,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Wink of an Eye (TV Episode 1968)","Great idea and story. Decent execution, acting, music. But major plot holes.","The idea of an alien race living and moving so fast that people in normal time cannot see them is great. The aliens, Scalosians, depopulated by volcanic radiation in their water, males are sterile, and they're down to 5 people, including 2 females, their queen Deela, and one other hot chick. Scalos is a dead world once occupied by an advanced civilization of 900,000, destroyed not by their own hands, but form nature, killing the weak, sterilizing most, and speeding up any survivors. What a life? What's interesting is that even though they are stuck in this sped time line, and their civilization is basically dead, these people are arrogant, consider others inferior, and have a plan. They are dangerous and stupid. They send SOS messages to passing spaceships to trap them and accelerate the males to their time line so they can impregnate the two females to repopulate their civilization. They lie and say they don't know what's happened. This plan is obviously not working. There are no children and they're down to 5 people! One of the problems with the newly trapped and accelerated males is that they do not live very long, are fragile and docile, and will die from the smallest damage, like a scratch. As others have noted, they should be dead after the first intercourse.The Enterprise heeds the SOS call and beam down to Scalos. Compton, one of the away team is taking samples from the Scalosian water and, like a dumbass wipes his mouth with the water, seconds later in front of McCoy he disappears. Compton inadvertently accelerated himself into the Scalosian timeline. The away team heads back to the Enterprise, and reports come from all over the ship of malfunctions. The Scalosians beamed up with the away team. Sulu and Uhura both detected malfunctions, then correction. The Scalosians have modified the ship so they can use it in their timeline. Kirk and Spock realize they have been invaded, and they find an alien device hooked up to the ship's life support system that they cannot remove or destroy. Deela spikes Kirk's coffee with Scalosian water. Kirk is accelerated and she kisses him and introduces herself as the enemy. She says she wants to mate with Kirk and says she is their queen and he will be their king. Kirk heads to life support and is confronted by Compton who has accepted his accelerated situation, and says he met a girl like no other. He has become docile to his situation. Kirk is stunned by the Scalosians, Compton tries to protect Kirk and is attacked and dies from a skin cut, aging quickly. Deela is so arrogant and confident of her success that she shows Kirk the alien device, and explains their plan, to freeze the Enterprise crew for later use, and use the males to repopulate Scalos. She is like an insect Queen, males are drones, only good for work and mating and dying soon after mating. Rael, Deela's scientist, lies to Kirk and says that in Kirk's struggle with Compton he scratched Compton causing his death. Rael is a true lying evil villain. Excellent acting. Kirk has a plan. Deela catches Kirk in the medical lab recording a message for Spock explaining the situation. Instead of stopping him, she explains more, and says by the time they get the message it will be too late. Rael contacts Deela saying the life support device will soon be operational, and that she should transport back to Scalos with Kirk. Kirk disables the transporter. He then tries to buy more time by taking Deela to his quarters for sex. Rael trying to fix the transporter, calls Deela, but she doesn't answer. Kirk puts on his boots as Deela fixes her hair. He did her! Rael in a jealous rage barges in and attacks Kirk trying to break his skin and kill him. Kirk runs and backs up. Deela orders Rael to stop. When Rael continues attacking Deela stuns him, then stuns him again. This was great. Rael tells Deela you know how I feel. Deela says I don't care that aspect of it. She doesn't care how Rael feels. After Rael leaves, Kirk plays docile to distract Deela to steel her weapon. In the normal time line, Spock and McCoy analyze the coffee Kirk drank, the Scalosian water and come up with a revers to the acceleration. Spock drinks the Scalosian water and is accelerated. We see Kirk and Spock attack Rael and destroy his freezing device. Kirk and Spock then beam Deela and Rael back to Scalos. Deela knows they will quarantine the area so no other space ships will be trapped, in effect dooming the Scalosians. But they were already dead. Their plan was not working. Kirk drinks the cure and is back in normal time. Spock fixes the ship in accelerated time, then cures himself.1, Kirk apparently is superhuman. He doesn't become docile like Compton, die from having sex with Deela. 2, The main plot problem is the alien and normal time lines do not reconcile. The Enterprise crew and the aliens get the same amount of movement. For Spock and McCoy to come up with a formula to bring Kirk back to normal time, they would need months of alien time. Also, the aliens experience the Enterprise crew in super slow motion, so how could they know so much of what they are doing. They would also have to wait for months in their timeline for anything to happen on the Enterprise or outside their world. Also, for the Enterprise crew to receive a distress call and head down to Scalos and head back up to the Enterprise, the Scalosians would probably age years in their timeline. The solution would be to slow the Scalosians down a bit. This would give enough time for the Enterprise crew to find a solution. Also, Spock after meeting with McCoy and Nurse Chapel, rather than heading to the bridge, he should have stayed in the lab and found Kirk's message. This would also shorten the time on the Enterprise timeline. This timeline business is a tough one, and one should give some slack for a 50 minute tv show. But the idea is great, fast living aliens on a dying planet, almost like an insect society trapping outsiders in a web, accelerating the males and turning them into docile short living mates. 3, Other reviewers asked why didn't Kirk try to help the Scalosions. He did. He offered to enlist the entire Starfleet to find a cure for Deela and her people. But she said some tried, but all died. Also, the formula that Spock had worked on Kirk and Spock, who were newly accelerated, may not have worked on the Scalosians.4, This is great Star Trek. Kirk, Deela and Rael are acted well. Spock, McCoy and the rest are ok, not the best acted. Spock - Nimoy looks like he's reading his lines or is bored. Scott and Sulu after Kirk drank the coffee and disappeared were worried that since they drank the coffee they would disappear too, Spock in 100% Vulcan mode, unpassionately just walked away.5, Cinematography is excellent, with Tilted ""Dutch angles"" while in accelerated time line. Music is also excellent, adding to the accelerated time line. The new fx are also great. The Matte painting of the Scalosian city and the set of the fountain is great. 6, Deela is smart, knows it's her duty and what she must do, the other female is also ready for the job. Rael the head scientist is in love with Deela, but he's sterile and jealous. The other 2 males help Rael. The women are dressed sexy and seductive. The males are dressed effeminate. Rael in the SOS message also sounds effeminate and has a very feminine walk about him, probably done to look passive and deceive any passing spaceships. If the Scalosians were doing this for generations, Deela mentions that her parents and their parents before them did this, kidnapping spacemen for breading purposes, why aren't there any children or other people? There should have been another scene with the other Scalosians, the female and the other two males. There should have also been more Scalosians on the planet that stayed behind. 7, In the intro Kirk on Scalos calls the Enterprise on the communicator. There is a red shirt guard standing behind Kirk, looking at his head. Why isn't this red shirt looking around securing the area or other functions? It shows strength and security. But it also looks like the guy is checking Kirk out. Very strange.8, Scott near the end, at the transporter sees Kirk and asks if Spock will be joining them too. The last time Scott saw Spock was in normal time. Scott wouldn't know if Spock was in the accelerated timeline. 9, Why did the 3 Scalosians leave the Enterprise without finding another male mate for the female after Compton died?10, There is a cheap soap opera theme with jealousy and sex/drama. Kirk and Deela forced romance and duty. Rael jealousy and duty. The Enterprise crew stilted performance, and their scenes should have been cut. There are a few moments of crew members just standing and trying to look worried, like Scott and Sulu worried that they may also disappear like Kirk. McCoy and Nurse Chapel after Spock accelerates and disappears. At the end Spock fixes the ship in accelerated time, reappears and says to Kirk, I found it an accelerating experience and walks away. Very dry. Flat humor. Also, Kirk saved the day. The only reason Spock was accelerated is to fix the ship, but Spock wouldn't have known if Kirk needed help. McCoy could have placed the cure all over the ship with a note for Kirk to find. I watched this episode 3 times this week and read the imdb user and critic reviews. It has its plot problems but the idea and execution is great Star Trek. Rating is a B+, 8 stars.",8
23,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Wink of an Eye (TV Episode 1968)",do my duty..,"Star TrekA cultural hub and by far one of the most loved and respected tale, Star Trek is created by Gene Roddenberry who wrote this brilliant concept, ahead of its time and is probably why it still doesn't fail to entertain us after these many years. It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. The series didn't seem to mature as it should have but definitely has improved on terms of implementing smarter approach, parallel plot lines and thought provoking concept.Season 03Contrary to expectations, second season failed to project the essential character development which would have give a perfect arc to the series and instead focused on different cases. In this final season the expectations are still higher as they have somehow glued their audience with their gripping screenplay and innovative imagination that doesn't flinch on pushing the boundaries.Wink Of An EyeCaptain Kirk's love track is repetitive, exhausting and walk on the same path and fumbles its way down to the road too, but Spock and his crew members has interesting input on some technical aspects that saves this sinking ship.",

This episode is very different from any other, and perhaps this explains some of the pointless critique I have seen.Deforrest Kelly called this his favorite episode. Those of you who fail to see its beauty are simply lacking in any artistic sense or human empathy.Of course there are mistakes with effects, plot, etc. Show me an episode of ANY show from the 60's that is pristine. Show me any Star Trek episode with a perfect plot. This episode isn't about these things. It is about Empathy. It is about love. It is about the ability to perceive the feelings of others, and to incorporate these so completely into your own emotional and mental state that you must act in such a way as to serve the interests of others just as you serve your own.This episode shows the pure love that exists between the big 3, and how each man will do his damnedest to protect the other, even unto death. This goes to the extent of even violating normal codes of conduct. This love is even expressed by Spock. Love is not only a gushy, touchy-feely thing. It is also respect, admiration, and duty. It is the moral imperative to serve one's comrades, and to sacrifice oneself if needed. No episode shows this so poignantly as this one, and this message is at the heart of all that is humane and civilized.Torture? Gratuitous? Not at all. Anybody who has ever lived a significant life knows that life involves all kinds of torture on a continual basis. It is all around us, in our schools, our jobs, and sometimes even our relationships. It is part of the natural world too, and we can even say that life itself is often torturous.The episode is a test for Gem, and the quickest way to evoke her empathic response is to injure somebody for no reason. This is exactly how any scientist would go about the experiment, were the test subjects considered to be below us like mice.This episode loudly proclaims the most powerful of all of the messages in the series: It is our capacity to feel what others feel and to act in the interests of others that makes civilized and humane. It is this which ensures our survival.But, as we all can see from the comments here, few people understand this. They do this for we live in an age where empathy is bad taste, and love is a cause for ridicule.",

It is an over-looked treasure I couldn't wait to get on DVD. The whole story takes place pretty much in one main facility. There are no back-and-forth to the ship or to other planets and stuff, which means the writing had to be extra clever to keep our attention. The big three of Kirk, Spock, and Bones, are forced to show an alien female what it means to sacrifice your life for someone else. The experiment is conducted by two superior alien beings who lose the meaning of life themselves in the midst of all the testing. With all the bickering Spoke and Bones do, you really see how much compassion they have for each other and their captain.",
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Empath (TV Episode 1968)",The Best of the Silent Era!,"Kathryn Hays' mime portrayal of Gem ranks with the finest of the silent actresses, such as Lillian Gish in her work for D.W.

Don't know why she wasn't at least nominated for the Sci-Fi version of the Academy Award for this performance, she's quite good in all her other work as well, even though her voice doesn't quite live up to her acting ability. This episode remains among my ""top 10""list of TOS favorites. The interplay of emotion between McCoy & Spock truly brings forth the camaraderie they shared, and the feelings, respect, and admiration they felt toward each other. But again, if you've never seen a silent classic, or a character portrayal By the like of Lillian Gish, take time to watch an old silent, and see just how beautiful they were!",10

To be able to take the pain and suffering from someone and transfer it onto oneself while removing that pain and suffering from another is an incredible concept. It made me wonder - Were any of the great healers in ancient times physical empaths? The actress playing Gem I thought was excellent,watching her throughout the episode was as Spock would say, fascinating.Sometimes we don't need million dollar special effects and wild chase scenes to have a beautiful episode. And where would we be as human beings without empathy ?",10
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Empath (TV Episode 1968)",A moving portrait of camaraderie and concern for others,"Kirk, Spock, and McCoy find themselves trapped in the laboratory of two callous alien scientists who subject them to experiments to measure their will to live and their willingness to sacrifice themselves for others. At the center of the experiments in Gem, a mute woman with the ability to absorb the injuries of others, but only at great cost to herself. The three Enterprise men discover the experiments are to see if Gem will sacrifice her own life to save them from the tortures the aliens will inflict.This episode falls just short of a ten. The flaws include the rather silly slo-mo running scene. Also a problem: the aliens' ultimate motive for their experiments. Once the motive is revealed, it seems a little too contrived and strained. The motive could have been handled better. And the aliens' decision to show compassion at the end seems a little too abrupt, but that part probably was unavoidable given the episode's time constraints. Also, the deaths of the two human scientists seem to get forgotten and glossed over by episode's end. Glossing indifferently over the deaths of minor characters by an episode's end, especially the deaths of red shirts, has always been a problem in the scripts of Star Trek. It takes away some of the humanity of the main characters.But, here, these are minor quibbles. Stacked up against all of that is an excellent script that slowly builds the foreboding and mystery as to what the aliens are up to and where Gem fits in. And we see a wonderful message of compassion and camaraderie in how the show's Big Three interact with each other and with Gem in this episode. Note, especially, how Spock reacts when he realizes McCoy is dying: there is no big change in his usual impassive demeanor, yet Leonard Nimoy manages to convey the real grief Spock must be feeling. This is the episode where the Big Three's friendship is put on full show, and it is awesome to watch.And at the center of the show is a superb performance by Kathryn Hays as Gem. Her Gem is utterly beautiful, gentle, and heart breaking, and Hays' silent movie style acting a joy to watch, especially in the final scene. Whatever chronic script problems Star Trek TOS ever suffered from, that show frequently got great guest performances.",9

There are encounters with strange aliens all the time in this series, but this is the first time that a somewhat more intellectual and emotional interaction is portrayed, and we get a picture of what it would mean to be alien.I enjoyed it and was even a little moved when Gem tries to save McCoy and McCoy tries to save her in turn. That said, there seems to be a considerable tonal shift in the series by season 3, and this episode of part of it. I'd rate it a 7.5.",8

She has one of the most expressive faces I have ever encountered. Granted, it is difficult to watch. The scenes of torture are really quite unnerving. The beings that are testing the young empath are cruel and have lost their right to make judgments. Nevertheless, to react with such rage about this episode. Unless it is some throwaway summer B horror movie to throw a one rating at it is like spitting on someone's birthday cake. Let's consider what else was on in those days, the vapid sitcoms and crummy cop shows. At least let's consider the effort to confront philosophical issues and stretch our minds a bit.",7
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Empath (TV Episode 1968)",Tortured Like Rats in a Trap,"The main trio (Kirk,Spock,McCoy) beam down to a planet whose sun is on the verge of going nova. The 2-man scientific team assigned to the planet is missing and our heroic trio are whisked away underground in the same manner. They are the subjects of some creepy experimentation by a couple of big-headed aliens who are, in actuality, testing another prisoner - a female mute who also possesses true empathetic powers: she can absorb the injuries of another person onto herself. This episode can sharply divide the fanbase: you are either enamored of the stylistic, minimalist approach here or you aren't. I am not. The scenes of the trio walking around the darkened chamber of wherever they are just scream 'ran out of funds!' This is also one of the least eventful episodes - a 25 minute ""Twilight Zone""-type show dragged out to twice that length. Hence, it's extremely dull in half the scenes. There's even a lengthy scene in slow motion; you know an episode's in trouble when it resorts to a drawn-out shot of Kirk running at 2 miles per hour, gesticulating strangely.I can't find any fault with the actress, Hays, who plays the sympathetic mute alien; her performance does the art of mime and silent film acting proud. But, she can't save this one. Even the entire premise of the story is faulty: the supposedly advanced aliens here are basing their plan to save an entire planet's population on the test results of one subject. This is meaningless. Even if she reacts in the most positive manner to their tests, what does this prove? What if 90% of her race are actually selfish uncaring snobs? The alien testers are just wasting their time with pointless torture - this is what Kirk should have spelled out to them in the end, not his now-patented speech about compassion vs. intellect, the latest version of the speech he usually saves for wrong-thinking machines. At the conclusion, the testers seem to shrug and acquiesce to Kirk's pleas, a not very exciting climax. The one interesting aspect to the plot is a continuation of the Spock-McCoy competition in achieving their respective death wishes, but even this is simply a repetition of their tension in ""The Immunity Syndrome."" On the other hand, you may look at this as McCoy's chance to get back at Spock for 'winning' their round in that earlier episode.",4
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Empath (TV Episode 1968)",Lab animals,"One of the best of Star Trek episodes is this one when the Enterprise comes upon a superior alien race that select the landing party of William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley and a pair of unnamed crewmen as guinea pigs in a psychological experiment. The aliens look like second cousins to the Talosians and we know what intellects they had. You also know what happens to unnamed crewmen in any Star Trek episode.This crowd is almost as good or bad depending on your point of view. The three regulars are put into a room together with a deaf mute named Gem played by Kathryn Hays. She cannot speak, but her facial expressions tell much because Hays is a total empath with healing powers. As all the series regulars are tortured, Hays heals them. But like that other healer from the big screen, John Coffey in The Green Mile it takes a lot out of Hays every time she heals. It's soon clear she's the object of the alien experiment.As Kirk tells them at the end these experiments are futile because these aliens have evolved into pure intellect, way beyond even that noted Enterprise intellect Spock. Empathy is not something you can objectively analyze. You either have it or you don't. A little more empathy, a little less intellect without sacrificing too much is what this old world needs.Nice issues are developed in this fine Star Trek story.",8
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Empath (TV Episode 1968)","Kirk, Spock and McCoy are part of a cruel experiment","When an away team go down to an alien planet that is about to be destroyed by a supernova to retrieve a two man research team they find their base abandoned and covered in dust. A solar storm causes the Enterprise to move away leaving Kirk, Spock and McCoy on the surface. Soon afterwards they find themselves teleported to dark room with no apparent way out. In the room there is a beautiful woman who appears to be totally mute who is named Gem by McCoy. It turns out that she is the prisoner of the Vians. Two Vians injure Kirk and Gem demonstrates her empathic powers by curing him; she does this by taking his injuries herself. This means as the cut on his head vanishes an identical cut appears on her. Spock then discovers a way out of the room; this takes them to another room where they discover the two missing researchers, dead, in two tubes there are three more tubes with the names Kirk, Spock and McCoy on them. They manage to escape to the surface, but not for long. Back in the Vian's custody Kirk finds himself the victim of tortuous experiments after being returned he is told they will experiment on McCoy or Spock next; it is stated that it is likely that McCoy would die but while Spock wouldn't die it was very likely that he would be brain damaged. The difficult choice is taken out of his hands when McCoy sedates the other two. His actions lead to him being taken and seriously injured it is only when he is returned that we learn that the real subject of the experiment is Gem; how will the empath respond when helping McCoy could lead to her own death?.This is an interesting and emotional episode dealing with the idea of self-sacrifice. Having Gem mute makes her more mysterious as she can't tell people about herself; the members of the away team must determine for themselves what she is and decide whether she is a fellow prisoner or working with those holding them captive. Kathryn Hays does a fine job in the role; expressing Gem's emotions entirely through facial expressions. We also see how our protagonists are each willing to sacrifice themselves to save their friends; the actors do a fine job making this totally believable. The Vians are interesting antagonists and even though their experiments aren't ethical their motives are actually pure for reasons I won't spoil here. The low budget clearly shows but this actually works to the episodes advantage in places as the dark, minimalist sets create a sinister atmosphere. The torture scenes are mild in comparison to those in many series but are still pretty strong for a show broadcast at dinner time given that we see some injury detail. Overall I found this to be a pretty good episode.",8
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Empath (TV Episode 1968)",The Empath,"The Minarian Star System has a sun that is about to nova: Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are visiting the second planet in this star system to meet with two researchers stationed to study this nova. They are ""teleported"", as the researchers before them, to a darkened place underground, where the trio discover a mute empath, with the wondrous ability to ""adsorb"" physical injury and agony from another, studied by two emotionless, intellectual alien beings whose own planet in the Minarian Star System will perish once the sun novas. For some reason these aliens are ""testing"" Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, their personal characteristics among other factors, and it seems to revolve around the empath. This episode explores the torture Kirk and Bones withstand as Spock attempts to understand a weapon they use, hopefully to their own benefit when the time presents itself. The planet itself is a bit unstable for the Enterprise to orbit so Kirk insists Scotty (in command of the ship) to keep just away so no damage can be done to her—that is until the moment arises where the Enterprise can once again orbit the planet and beam Kirk, Spock, and Bones back to the ship. ""The Empath"" is one of those episodes featuring the cold laboratory alien scientists experimenting with humans, testing their resolve, ability to withstand pain, trying to gain on perspective on what makes them tick, curious if they will able to usher in character traits important and beneficial to suit the needs of their grand plan as it pertains to the empath. Kirk fights a psychological battle with a foe technologically advanced but in need of a moral lesson in right and wrong. Kathryn Hays is ideally cast because of her angelic beauty and photogenic face. This is one of those episodes that care more about the story, performances, and characters than the usual balance of drama and action. Sure violence is used by the aliens for a supreme purpose in the motivation of the empath, but this isn't as much a battle of fists (weapons) and mind, as it a battle of emotion and mind...Kirk will have to force them to see what they've lost, and what little remains of what they once were. In order for Kirk to save his men (and eventually the empath), he will have to force the aliens to examine the loss of their emotional core and moral ethics because the use of phasers will not rescue any of them from this situation. I like this episode, recognizing that the story takes precedence over extravagant sets and colorful aliens. I think ""The Empath"" deserves a second look, particularly by Trek fans who are desiring something different and unexpected. Sure you know Kirk will find some way, but how he does so is rather profound; it is hard to penetrate the intellectual shell of aliens, and getting them to look at their own frailties, certainly not an easy feat. While the reputation of this third season is wholly unpleasant, I do think there are gems ready for discovery.",8
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Empath (TV Episode 1968)","Been there, done that... and MUCH better!","There's long been a number of ST's that I rank as the ""worst"" episodes, among them ""MIRI"", ""BREAD AND CIRCUSES"", ""THE GAMESTERS OF TRISKELLION"", ""THE PARADISE SYNDROME"", ""SPOCK'S BRAIN"", ""PLATO'S STEPCHILDREN"". This one is squarely on the list. It's slow, it's cheap-looking, it pointlessly vicious, and parts of it don't even make much sense.I had a feeling, like with ""IS THERE IN TRUTH NO BEAUTY?"", that I was almost watching an OUTER LIMITS episode. Then I read the comments about ""NIGHTMARE"", and the fact that both were directed by the same person. Too much! Just as LOST IN SPACE's 3rd season spent quite a few episodes doing ""LIS"" versions of 1st-season ST's, ST's 3rd season spent quite a few episodes doing inferior versions of stories already seen on other shows. Among them were ""WINK OF AN EYE"" (done much better on THE WILD WILD WEST), ""TURNABOUT INTRUDER"" (done much better on THE OUTER LIMITS, and THE AVENGERS as well), ""THE PARADISE SYNDROME"" (well, by this point, just about every show on network TV had already done an ""amnesia"" story).Kathryn Hays is incredibly beautiful and does a great job as a member of an alien race quite different from anything we've seen before, even though she looks totally human. An interesting idea not properly dealt with, due to the nature of this particular story.Davis Roberts is a terrific character actor I've seen on many shows, including TARZAN, who's wasted in a role where he gets maybe 2-3 lines of dialogue before being murdered for no reason whatsoever. (""WE didn't kill them"", says the Vian. Right, like a guy holding a smoking gun will say it was the bullets that did the job.)At one point Kirk brings up The Prime Directive. I can't think of a single instance where that thing was MORE uncalled-for and out of place than here. It seems to me The Prime Directive was a poorly-conceived idea of Gene Roddenberry's that he hatched when he wrote ""THE OMEGA GLORY"" (an episode so bad it was shelved for 2 whole years before being dusted off!). It's used so inconsistently, it's more of a joke and a gimmick used in poorly-thought-out episodes. Federation personnel are kidnapped, tortured and murdered by a pair of heartless ""scientists"" (the phrase ""AND YOU CALL YOURSELF A SCIENTIST?"" comes to mind), and he insanely quotes the P.D. saying it's not HIS place to ""interfere"".And what about self-preservation? Kirk should have SHOT first and asked questions later. Instead, he tries to talk to 2 killers and winds up without any weapons, at their mercy. The rest of the story involves Kirk, Spock & McCoy arguing about which one of them should gladly commit suicide (more or less).In the entire 3-year run of STAR TREK, I think the Vians may top my list of villains I just wanted to see DEAD. Not only them, but their entire civilization with them. Imagine if Ron Tracy had been their victim. HE'd have shown those ""scientists"" what he thought of them. (Marv Wolfman & George Perez may well have taken inspiration from the Vians when they created the ""Psions"", a very similar alien race of cold-hearted scientists who pursue knowledge without any care how many countless innocent lives are damaged or destroyed in the process.) I know this will sound sexist, but what was going on with all these 3rd-season stories being written by women? And, on the other side of the coin, WHERE was D.C. Fontana? I didn't see her name in the end credits. I guess a change in story editor was part of the reason for the show's decline in this period.The 2nd Varese Sarabande CD of newly-re-recorded STAR TREK scores (1986) included Fred Steiner's version of George Duning's score for this episode. After seeing Duning's name on quite a few other episodes, I find myself wishing they'd have included one of the OTHER ones, instead.Finally, NBC had nothing to do with the budget cut. That was all Paramount. When Lucille Ball's new husband convinced her to sell Desilu to Paramount, the big movie studio was in deep dept from too many expensive films bombing at the box office. When they found themselves now running a TV studio, the first thing they did was order the budgets on all ""their"" shows slashed-- so they could use the money to make bigger, even more expensive bombs.When MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE's creator & producer Bruce Geller heard the order, he told all his department heads-- ""This year, SPEND MORE."" The network was thrilled. They'd already paid for the shows. The sponsors were thrilled. Ditto. Paramount was P***ED. But because Gene Roddenberry had stepped down (feeling rightly so that he'd been shafted by NBC over the schedule change), he wasn't around to make a difference. Imagine if Roddenberry had done what Geller had. STAR TREK's 3rd season MIGHT have been its best-ever, and that could have made a difference in the ratings. We'll never know.",2

The landing party of Kirk, Spock, and Bones ares subsequently beamed down to a strange laboratory hundreds of meters below the planet's surface. There they meet a woman from a mute species who they name Gem. She seems to be an empath: someone who can feel the emotions and pain of another person, merge the two bodies together, and absorb whatever that other person maybe feeling. Soon two aliens known as Vians reveal themselves as this prison's keepers. They need a member of the Enterprise to partake in a dangerous experiment. After a few escape attempts, Kirk and Bones are tortured to the edge of death. Only Gem's powers bring them back from the brink. It turns out that this is all a test by the Vians on whether they should save Gem's race. With the star going nova, millions of people from various planets are doomed. The Vians only have the capability to save one planet's-worth of people. If Gem is able to show adequate compassion and self-sacrifice, it will prove that her people are a worthy race. Kirk chastises the Vians. In their experiment in empathy they seem to have lost their way. The Vians fully heal Bones and decide to save Gem's people. Spock, Kirk, and Bones return to the Enterprise with a new perspective on life.If IMDb trivia is to be believed, this was DeForest Kelley's favorite episode. I can't blame him; this episode is absolutely wonderful! While this does have a similar message to episodes done in the past, I don't think any of them are as nearly successful as this one. Kathryn Hays gives a perfect performance as the mute alien. All the emotion has to come from her face, her gestures, her expressions. She is able to pull it off like a world-class silent movie actress. I also love the idea of this species of empathetic people not being able to talk. Empathy doesn't need to be expressed in flowery word use or condolences; a simple look or a lone tear can be far more powerful.Most of the budget cuts in Season 3 make the episodes look a bit shoddier but I think it's really an advantage in this episode. The minimalist approach of a black backdrop and creative lighting is still visually striking today. I was blown away by some of these scenes. It looks less like a cheap set and more like an artistic direction. That one shot from behind of the torture chamber and chains is absolutely breathtaking.This episode proves that you don't need big budgets and fancy effects to make good science fiction, a little ingenuity and good acting should suffice.",10

Star Trek ran aground in the third year. The production and writing staffs mailed it in, the budgets were cut, and scripts were written with economy--not drama--in mind.While I appreciate the letter-writing campaign that saved the series, NBC scuttled it by lousy scheduling and crummy budgets.

It's like watching Groundhog Day: you see it once and you feel like you've seen it ten times. It's obvious at this point that the production team has run out of money and run out of ideas, and they are desperately just trying to fill minutes.Combining a virtually non-existent set, bad acting, bad special effects, and a plot so simple that it quickly becomes un-engaging; this episode fails to maintain the illusion of drama. It no longer looks like Kirk, Spock, and McCoy trudging along some alien planet in palpable peril. It looks like Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley bumbling about a Hollywood stage counting the minutes until they could go home and watch a ball game.The mission of the production crew for this episode seemed to be: find a girl with very sad looking eyes and let's do a hundred close-up shots of her eyes, and then fill the rest of the episode with fluff. I consider the principles of empathy and self-sacrifice to be noble and inspiring. This episode simply doesn't do these principles justice. What the Empath girl was doing wasn't really free-will sacrifice because they were all pawns in the aliens laboratory. Every time she healed a crew-member, she was enabling the aliens to have more subjects to torture. She was effectively a useful fool perpetuating the torture cycle with her ""empathy"". The truly empathetic action would have been for her to refuse to play along with the ""experiment"" and stop enabling the sadists.Between the syrupy, fluttery music, the Empath's over-exaggerated mime expressions, and the blinking ""special effects"" I felt like I was watching a high school's failed attempt at modern dance. I say all this as an ardent Star Trek fan. Episodes like this are just painful to watch because they show how far Star Trek had fallen.",3
17,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Empath (TV Episode 1968)","""Best of the silent era""?","I know this will probably sound mean, but I was surprised by one comment about this episode that said the performance of the leading lady ranked with the ""best of the silent era"". I have seen hundreds of silent films and I would seriously beg to differ! Her character was pretty dreadful and it reminded me more of a mime than a silent actress.Now as for the rest of the episode, it's pretty sub-par, as the threesome of Kirk, Spock and McCoy are stuck in a dark sound studio that is supposed to be some lab run by guys who look very reminiscent of the aliens in THE MENAGERIE (the first Star Trek pilot). Here, they do lots of experiments on the men in order to get the mute woman to develop empathy--all of which time the crew behave very protectively towards her. In the end, after a whole lotta torture (even worse than for us watching the episode), they are released and everything is apparently cool.The bottom line is that this is a minimalist episode where most of it could have been filmed in a dark theater. The plot is ultra simple and the show is amazingly dull and lethargic. Not a great episode at all.",4
18,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Empath (TV Episode 1968)",Beatnik Trek,"There's a lot of criticism of Star Trek's third season, and deservedly so. And, among those stories, this one seems to have gotten its share of bashing for the skeleton like production values.Where I agree with the thrust of a lot of the reviews I would like to point out some of the more redeeming aspects of this episode. To me it seems more of a dramatic exercise for the actors. We're witnessing performances, not so much a plethora of adventure and special effects.It's the kind of thing a university acting class would do. It's the kind of thing a local theatre troupe would conjure to keep their creative and performance juices fresh and active. That's the charm of this episode. The ability to pull off a story with a fraction of the budget.Regrettably there's only so much frugal art that the audience (in this case the Trek fan base) can take. Without offering something more meaty for us to chew on, Trek was doomed with continued efforts like this one.Still, for me at least, this episode has a certain charm to it. The theme of intellect-verse-emotion is abundant, and how one collides and synergizes with the other is made all too plain. The story shows an imbalance of sorts, but then shows the audience the true meaning of who and what we are, and what it is to be human.It's an interesting episode. It lacks gloss and punch, but from a dramatic point of view it is an interesting exercise.",
19,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Empath (TV Episode 1968)",Three little guinea-pigs stuck with a mime.,"An unusual episode, with a more calm, subdued atmosphere, and yet with plenty of torture and pain, mostly involving Kirk and McCoy. TE goes over-the-top with its umpteenth reiteration of the loyalty that exists among McSpoKirk, which culminates in a somewhat pathetic game of ""who's-the-sacrifical-lamb"". McCoy outwits Spock in order to save him. To cut a long story short, it's almost as though all three of them are dying to finally die! Maybe they just wanted to get out of the series...Spock: ""I shall die, Captain. I am not that relevant.""Kirk: ""No, Spock, I will die. That's an order."" McCoy: ""Will you two shut up! It's me who'll die, and that's final!""Self-sacrifice, Hollywood style...The setting is very good, and the story more sci-fi-ish than usual. Some Trekkies point out how dumb the brainy aliens must be to use one single mute woman to experimentally represent an entire race. However, one can argue that it's implied that these aliens know that the mute race isn't particularly individualistic, i.e. that one specimen pretty much represents all in most or all ways. Lack-of-logic criticisms should be made regarding supposedly terrific episodes, turkeys such as ""The Doomsday Machine"" or ""The Naked Time"".",

Now this whole concept is an incredible emotional powerhouse . Gem is one of my all time favorite characters. Her performance along w the wonderful composition which is very unusual almost jazz like or early what used to be called 20th century music is just so powerful.

The ultra-cheap (£2.45 at the most) production design? The rubbish, overblown performances where every line, between the words, cried ""oh, Gawd, I can't believe I'm contractually obliged to do this""? The completely uninvolving story line? The lack of budget for most of the regular cast? Nope. None of those. A bit of careful direction could have gotten away with any of them. It's the hideous, sickening, mawkish score which only serves to highlight every one of this episodes weaknesses and none of its strengths (few though they are).I'm seriously in need of stemetol pills watching this. Vile! Vile! Vile!",1
22,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Empath (TV Episode 1968)","Disastrous, painful episode.","It is said this episode was written by a fan of the original show. If so, she had little sense of both the message and the true potential of the series. Then again, the post-Roddenberry production team may have felt just cynical enough to have accepted this episode as just a sufficiently pale imitation of sharper and more - ha ha - empathetic - scripts to satisfy NBC and the series' sponsors... and to pad out the pathetic production schedule.For an episode so lacking in originality and in substance, it is also creepily telling that both the episode's director and one of the two lead villains had both participated in an ""Outer Limits"" episode called ""Nightmare"" five years earlier which was all too similar to the whole fetid torture scenario of ""The Empath."" If this episode was not overall as desperately painful to watch as ""Spock's Brain,"" it's only because the guest actors are LESS rotten and the plot holes are LESS glaring. But it's still extremely unpleasant viewing. I recommend turning the sound off and just watching Kathryn Hays making all the other actors look like Drama 101 morons.Now... as regards the notion that the ""minimalistic"" black sets were done for ""psychological effect,"" as has been contended since 1968... horse manure. The amateurish nature of this production assures that you can tell that the actors are traipsing around a dim soundstage looking only to hit their marks on the floor when the spotlights hit them. If you believe that the episode, with a budget cut to smithereens, was shooting for psychological effect, then you need also to believe that exactly the same ""effect"" was being sought by set designers on ALL the other fantasy and adventure series in 1968 which had also had their budgets slashed, including ""Batman,"" ""Lost In Space,"" and ""Land of the Giants."" So no, I don't buy it.Next: The music of George Dunning. By this point in the series, viewers had become used to the overriding presence of cues by Fred Steiner, Alexander Courage, Gerald Fried, Alexander Courage, and Sol Kaplan. Dunning had a solid background in film scoring, although not particularly for sci-fi as far as I have seen. This was the second year of the show in which episodes with strong female leads were more or less automatically handed to Dunning and his spacey organs and perpetually swelling, love-scene style strings. Dunning's strength in these circumstances was in doing a lot with a little; he did not need full orchestrations to convey atmosphere, and I imagine this appealed to the producers of the uber-cheapie third season. (By the way, the third season had the fewest produced episodes of the three years, and had the smallest number of episodes with original music of the three years). Like or dislike the music Dunning wrote for the episode (including his tiny paraphrase of Gerald Fried's Vulcan theme in the last scene), at least it fared better than Steiner's and Courage's scores did, which were simply unable convincingly to convey the same strength and emotion with the vastly slashed orchestras they were allowed to work with in 1968. Face it, Dunning's score carries this episode, same as ""Is There In Truth No Beauty?"" and ""Metamorphosis."" Oh by the way, ""...Beauty?"" is another episode written by a series fan rather than by anyone with a background in screenplay writing, or even a clue.Next: The torture. I am sorry, this was indefensible. Under no circumstances is the case convincingly made, in the script, that torture is necessary, or positive, or unavoidable. Instead, the three ""good guys"" seem only too ready to submit themselves to torture. It's disgusting, and it's over the top, and I question the credibility of NBC's Standards & Practices Department, which allowed it to be produced and aired. This is not a statement I make with the hindsight of the Bush Administration's masturbatory obsession with torture, because this episode has always given me the creeps. If prisoners identify so closely with their captors that they actually OFFER to be punished, does that not at the very least mean they're suffering from Stockholm Syndrome? Other problems with this episode: 1) ""The sandbats of Manarka IV""?? Are you kidding me? 2) In the scene in which Kirk is hanging from the chains and shot from the rear, a body double is clearly and clumsily used. Once the view switches to the front, Shatner is basically framed from the base of the neck up. It's clear why this was: 1968 was officially the ""Captain Fatty"" year.3) Apparently, in the unremastered original, the producers were at one point so haplessly clumsy that they used a stock Enterprise flyover with the wrong color planet. Weak!",2
23,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Empath (TV Episode 1968)",Hays was ethereal,"Thought this was an above average episode. Sometimes less is more, IMO the lack of the usual cheesy and laughable special effects, props and costumes was a huge plus. I found Gem's performance absolutely mesmerizing.",8
24,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Empath (TV Episode 1968)","""Their will to survive is great"".","I had another one of my oddball observations while watching this show. Could this have been one of Bill Clinton's favorite Star Trek episodes? You know, because of his signature line - ""I feel your pain"". Picture him saying it and biting his lower lip, the way Darrell Hammond did on 'Saturday Night Live'. Hilarious.I have to agree with a couple other reviewers on this board who felt the scientific method of the two Vians was a little off base. They were going to make their decision on who's planet to save based on an experiment with Gem (Kathryn Hays)? Not too much pressure there now, do you think? The other thing that never ceases to amaze me is how an alien like Gem (sure, she was humanoid, I get it), manages to affect a perfect application of female beauty secrets. Check out the flawless eye shadow and mascara, while the nail polish treatment was definitely superb. I'm not sure if all of this was necessary for Gem to learn human compassion, but I guess it helped. The twist in the story is that instead of being merely captives of the Vians, the Enterprise Trio were to perform the role of teachers, demonstrating their will to survive, their love of life, and their passion to know. It would have been somewhat more satisfying if the Vians' takeaway from all this might have left them better positioned to save the universe, but they seemed rather non-plussed as the story came to a close. That's the trouble with pure intellect, you never connect with the emotional side of the equation.",7
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Elaan of Troyius (TV Episode 1968)",Captain Kirk falls in love . . .,". . . yet again. He's always falling in love, isn't he? So that doesn't make this episode very special.What makes it special, though, is the excellent, over-the-top characterization of the Elasians, especially Kirk's (William Shatner) eventually hormonal target, Elaan (France Nuyen). That characterization, and the fantastic interaction it leads to, can be credited both to fine writing by John Meredyth Lucas and fine performances from Nuyen, Shatner, and the rest of the cast.Elas has been at war with Troyius, a neighboring planet of the Tellun system, for a very long time. In yet another ""Star Trek"" reflection of the Cold War between the U.S. and Russia, which was going strong in 1968, Elas and Troyius now have the nuclear capabilities to ""blow each other up"". So the leaders of each planet came up with a solution--to wed Elaan, the Dohlman (a female royal title similar to a princess) of Elas to the governor of Troyius, thus brokering a union between the planets politically. The problem, however, is that the last thing on Elas or elsewhere that Elaan wants to do is marry the governor of Troyius. The Enterprise's mission is to escort Elaan to the wedding. This is complicated by the presence of a Troyian ambassador on board and the shadowy, then later threatening presence of a Klingon ship in the vicinity. It seems the Klingons have a vested interest in the Tellun system.The Klingon subplot is good, and neither under nor overwritten, but as I mentioned above, this episode shines for its darkly humorous character dynamics. The Elasians were a wonderful creation, one that it would have been nice to periodically revisit in the ""Star Trek"" universe. They're amazingly arrogant, domineering, and single-minded, yet somewhat simple and have an odd lack of confidence, expressed sometimes as passiveness and sometimes as frustration that frequently pokes through. That's not an easy combination of qualities to play, but Nuyen does it with style and grace so that she really seems like a member of culturally bizarre alien royalty. The Elasians' disputatious nature, at least barring complete subservience to their customs, provides a lot of entertainment, including Elaan's attempt to murder someone on board and one of my favorite moments--Kirk's admonition that if Elaan doesn't behave, he's going to have to spank her. The reaction of Spock and McCoy when they surprise Elaan and Kirk at one point is priceless, too. Spock and McCoy actually have relatively little to do in this episode, but they do it well and are frequently very funny.Nuyen is made to look particularly exotic and attractive in an unusual way, with interesting, Egyptian-themed make-up and hair, plus plenty of sexy costumes that it's easy to see Roddenberry's hand in (pun intended, of course). Without the personality, and maybe even with it, Kirk probably wouldn't have needed much assistance in falling head over heels for her. The other Elasian costumes are a hoot, too, their most outstanding features being bright orange pieces of foam that look like, well, bright orange pieces of foam.",9
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Elaan of Troyius (TV Episode 1968)","Glory to Elaan, Dohlman of Elas","Federation space politics and diplomacy are at the forefront of the plot, exemplified earlier by the well-known ""Journey to Babel"" episode. Kirk and his ship do not play courier to dozens of ambassadors as before; here there's only one. Oh, and a creature known as the Dohlman (translation: spoiled brat of a princess i.e.more trouble than a 100 ambassadors), whom the ambassador must train for her role as wife to the Troyiun prince. Some ground rules to observe when hosting a Dohlman: (1) kneel in her presence; (2) do not speak unless permitted; (3) do not leave without permission; (4) provide her with the best quarters on the ship; (4a) failing that, find other quarters; (5) provide breakable objects for her, but no pillows. These are for starters. Such a sophomoric attitude does provide more entertainment than the typical 3rd season episode and there are added elements of another touchy mission for Starfleet to bring peace to a region of space, as well as an unexpected attack by a Klingon warship. The likewise warlike Elasians make the Capellans of ""Friday's Child"" seem quite laid back by comparison. The story holds together well with all these plot turns in the first couple of acts and this episode is not boring - that's a given.There's a switch to more silly-like plot contrivances in the 2nd half of the episode, when Kirk becomes infected by Elaan's tears. According to legend, and 23rd-century biochemistry, tears of such a female enslave all men. This provides another excuse for Kirk to, uh, fraternize inappropriately with an alien woman who is generally regarded as off-limits. It's similar to his tryst with the female invader in ""Wink of an Eye"" only a few episodes earlier (Kirk really got going in this area of interstellar relations during the 3rd season). As the beyond-arrogant royal bitch, actress Nuyen was well cast; helped by her accent, she brings a suitably exotic flavor to the role, flinging knives and enjoying a meal with equal aplomb. My favorite scene is probably her put-down of Scotty; oy, watch what you say to a proud Scotsman! To the episode's credit, the audience should feel at least a twinge of pity for her by the conclusion, despite her earlier antics. One is reminded that the episode's title is ""Elaan of Troyius"" not 'Elaan of Elas.' She seems doomed and forsaken at the end to spend the remainder of her life behaving in a certain fashion, contrary to her nature. I also liked the space battle in this one; the music, especially, called to mind the battles of a decade later in ""Star Wars.""",7
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Elaan of Troyius (TV Episode 1968)","'Trek' has it's share of babes, but Elaan is...","...a super-babe. Make no mistake, this episode is a showcase for the exotic and ethereal beauty of Eurasian actress France Nuyen as Elaan. The storyline is secondary to the display of her charms and their predictable effect on perpetually-aroused James Kirk. Skimpy costumes and form-fitting gowns accentuate Nuyen's lithe, but femininely muscular build. Her vaguely French accent adds to her allure. Kirk can't help but fall prey to her feminine charms, with near-catastrophic results.That's not to say it's a bad story. The acting, especially by Nuyen, is first-rate. It's a fun twist on the ""Taming Of The Shrew"" theme, and when Elaan comes around at the end one feels a sense of completion as well as a lingering sense of desolation. She has to go on with her slated ""role"" as consort to the enemy society's ruler for the sake of peace between their people. But I have a feeling the bridegroom-in-waiting has more of a treat in store for him than he might otherwise have anticipated.Probably one of the better Season 3 episodes, which were generally lacking in pace and punch compared to seasons 1 and 2.",

After Kirk uncovers the psychology behind Elaan's temper, I ceased the wish for her quick drop into the dilithium chamber. Running opposite to Trek's usual choice for a beauty, Elaan is dark and petite, with a thicker accent slightly reminiscent of latter Gen's Counselor Troi. Trek reminded viewers that fulfilling duty is inevitable in order to be honorable. I felt the loss incurred in more than one of the characters' hearts at the finale.

4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Elaan of Troyius (TV Episode 1968)",Best Episode of 3rd Season,"While many of the scripts from the 3rd Season were mediocre and, in some cases, awful, this one maintained a level equal to the better stories of the first two seasons. A couple of things stand out. The battle sequence near the end, incorporating music that was never heard before or after, is tightly done with some good touches. Note Sulu's smile of admiration as Kirk announces the strategy to ""pivot at Warp 2"". Sulu's no dummy; he knows a great strategy when he hears one. Also, watch for the momentary glance to the left and right by Kirk after they engage warp power to the shields. He's alone, he's in command, and his next words will result in the crew's survival or death. This brief moment is utterly consistent with Kirk's character. He has voiced a fear of failure in the ""critical moment"" to McCoy in past conversations. This golden moment reveals his vulnerability and fear, but it's gone quickly, and he recovers to give the order. An outstanding moment in the Star Trek universe. Finally, the long-anticipated appearance of a Klingon ship was revealed for the first time. This original brilliant design by Jeffries remains the basis for Klingon ships to this day. You saw it here first. That, at the very least, makes this a notable episode.",9

It's always been one of my favorites since I was a kid. It had everything: space battles, romance, Klingons, etc. Granted, it's not as good as The Doomsday Machine or Balance of Terror or Amok Time, but it's certainly not as bad an episode as The Way to Eden or Plato's Stepchildren. The acting seemed pretty solid, especially between Kirk and Elaan. Granted, the costumes looked pretty cheap (they said the guards were wearing ""placemats""), and the rear wide-shots of Kirk and the navigator's position showed someone other than Chekov, but to me those were the only negative things about ""Elaan of Troyius"".",8

But it is Season Three slipping its shackles and supplying a top 20 (of the TOS 70-odd) episode.Early on, as the exclamations and cushions fly, the story is briefly in danger of becoming a serious embarrassment.But the interaction of Kirk and transported princess is as galaxy-popping as Kirk's romances get... you can enjoy similar escapades in, say, Mirror Mirror, and respect more solemnly the doomed love in City on the Edge of Forever, but the second half of Elaan of Troyius is pure first love/crush aboard combat mode spaceship.In entrapping Kirk Elaan's calculations are clear, but she gains much sympathy as someone who (First real love? Erstwhile impossible child suddenly develops maturity? Emotional depth prompted by probable immediate obliteration?) becomes responsible and even perhaps an asset to her fellow travellers.But – issues raised on marriage and diplomacy apart – this is from the first frame a comedy turn/showcase for one of SciFi's greatest guest stars. If you like your TOS austere and intelligent you shall despair, but if you prefer it to rove through every emotional high and moreover to do so with a unending belting grin, draw up a chair. There's no deep sci fi complexity here, but there is ample genius of acting, push-boat-out costume design, and eternal questions probed of youth, beauty, marriage and - duty.",9
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Elaan of Troyius (TV Episode 1968)",good story but problematic execution for this show,"When William Shatner interviewed Fred Freiberger, the show's final season executive producer, for his book 'Star Trek Memories' about the noticeable decline in quality of the final season's scripts, Fred observed that the first 3 scripts which came in for production in season 3 of Star Trek The Original Series was 'Spock's Brain', 'Spectre of the Gun' and 'Elaan of Troyius.' (p.265) The first episode is famously known as being a total disaster whereas the other two shows ""came out better"" in Fred's estimation. Elaan of Troyius is a better episode than Spock's Brain but the plot is not entirely convincing. Elaan, who comes from the backward Elasian civilization, is ordered to end a war between Elas and Troy by marrying the Troyian leader. She strongly resists this duty here. Once aboard the Enterprise, she throws temper tantrums (and knives) when her accommodation is not to her satisfaction partly because she doesn't want to marry into the civilized Troyian culture. When Petri, the Troyian ambassador, is stabbed by her, Kirk has to educate her himself. While Kirk touches her tears (which have aphrodisiac qualities) and falls in love with her, he eventually overcomes her spell because his love for the Enterprise--protecting the ship from the attacking Klingons--comes first and foremost. Frances Nuyen plays her part convincingly as the exotic Elaan. Kirk eventually succeeds in transporting Elaan safely to the Troyians and Elaan submits to her new Troyian masters. Unfortunately, however, we don't really see Kirk struggling between his newfound love for Elaan and his command of the Enterprise on the bridge--which would have made the storyline more compelling. (A scene of Kirk saying ""Elaan Elaan"" would have been nice) Several scenes of the show--as in many other season 3 offerings--suffer from poor lighting. This is a 'logical' show but there are 3 major plot holes. We have tensionless scenes of the sabotaging of the Enterprise's engines by Kryton, the Klingon agent, and his subsequent capture while we never witness Elaan's reaction in accepting Petri's gift of the gemstone necklace while the Enterprise is under attack. Finally, we can't divine Elaan's real agenda after she places Kirk under her spell other than her brief 'suggestion' about destroying Troyius. She could have been depicted as a cunning woman if she was also cooperating with the Klingons. There is clearly no morality tale about performing one's duty in this episode. Elaan continually resists travelling to Troyius even while the Enterprise is under attack by the Klingons--witness how she tries to cloud Kirk's mind on the bridge--until she sees that Kirk has broken her love spell by ordering the Enterprise to continue its voyage to Troyius rather than pursue the Klingon vessel. Its hard to feel sorry for the Dohlman even when you realise that her new 'formal' life on Troy runs counter to her outgoing personality since she is a very reluctant bride who constantly blames the Troyian council for dispatching her on this mission of peace. While the numerous sci-fi shots of the Klingon ship attacking the Enterprise are outstanding, the precise reasons for the Klingon's interference in Kirk's mission is uncertain. Was it about stealing Petri's gift of a dilitium crystals ('common stones') for Elaan or an attempt to frustrate the prospect of a Troyian-Elasian peace treaty and, thereby, embarrass the Federation since both planets are members of this organization? The latter scenario is supported by the fact of the Klingon's history of trouble making but the show is not entirely clear here. Compared to other poor season 3 episodes with stories that strained credulity or compromised the previous characterization of Star Trek actors, Elann of Troyius is still a nicely constructed show with great musical scores...but it suffers from poor execution once the Klingon's come into the picture. The episode is basically a story of 2 halves--the first part is nicely done whereas the second--when the Klingon's appear--is unconvincing.",6
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Elaan of Troyius (TV Episode 1968)","""Your Glory doesn't seem to be responding to instruction"".","It was a brief mention, but this episode took a stab at the super-power concept of MAD - Mutually Assured Destruction - between the planets of Troyius and Elas. Both had achieved a level of sophistication in their weaponry devastating enough to wipe out the other. What surprised me was that not much astonishment was offered by Captain Kirk and Spock when the Dohlman (France Nuyen) arrived aboard The Enterprise wearing a body armor nuclear weapon. What - did I hear that right? Body armor nuclear weapon!!! Granted, in the Star Trek future, nuclear weapons seemed small potatoes compared to photon torpedoes and phaser weapons, but still, she could have blown up the ship.There were a couple of times I was left puzzled by events in the story. For example, Elaan stabbed the Troyian ambassador Petri (Jay Robinson) in the back, and there was really no credible response by the Captain. Shouldn't he have at least called up a security detail? Maybe a form of house arrest confining her to quarters? Then there was Kryton's (Tony Young) sabotage of the dilithium crystal assembly, having sold out to the Klingons in a fit of jealousy over Elaan's pre-arranged marriage. One of the red-shirts jumped the gun on dispatching Kryton, but wouldn't it have been wise for Kirk to have some suspicion about the other two members of Elaan's party? This just seemed a little too bizarre for me.Finally, there was the way in which Captain Kirk managed to overcome the spell achieved by Elaan's Elysian tears. It always amazes me how the Captain can negate the laws of Star Trek science to defy whatever impediment is put in his way. Another example would be his immunity to the spore effect on Omicron Ceti III in #1.24 - 'This Side of Paradise'. It seems like a cheap way for the writers to come up with a solution and almost feels like a cop out, in this case, Kirk's dedication to the Enterprise above any possible love for a woman.But hey, the writers did get to put something past the censors near the end of the story, when McCoy challenges Spock with the classic line - ""Are you out of your Vulcan mind""?

Star Trek, to me anyway, was always about the self actualization of the self. This episode, which is about an arranged marriage in order to stop a war, is antithetical to that message. Elaan is expected to act a certain way because duty demands it; The Federation would probably not condone such a sexist practice as this, but this is sixties TV and as a society the US wasn't even close to the burning bra stage.2. This niggle is entirely about the episode's construction in act 3. Criton (sp), Elaan's guard, is a Klingon plant, and he sabotages the warp engines so that if the Enterprise goes into warp, it will blow up. Suddenly, and without warning, this plot is dropped and another one crops up; as the Klingons attack the Enterprise, Scotty discovers that the dilithium matrix is fused. There is no possibility of the ship going into warp. Now, the Klingons can pummel the E into submission as it flounders on impulse power. This is obviously to set us up for the deus ex machina to come, the fact that Elaan has crude dilithium crystals in her wedding necklace, which Spock discovers with his handy, dandy medical bio-scanner. One wonders why, when the Klingons wanted the Enterprise to GO INTO WARP, they would damage the part that allows it to do that. Fred Frieberger had the fundamental problem that most producers of SF TV and movies suffer from; since it's SF, we can do anything we want and not get caught. Thanks to the 'Net, if FF tried that crap today, he would get lambasted.",6

The problem is that Elaan is a barbaric ""female dog"" and has no intention of fulfilling her duties. And, once she comes aboard, she is a prima donna who need civilizing before she's ready to marry anyone. So, it's up to the Enterprise's version of Henry Higgens (Kirk) to civilize the beast. There's a subplot of an assassination attempt through sabotage that's thrown in for a little bit of tension.Overall this is a sub-par episode--mostly because the character of Elaan was so gosh-darn annoying and unlikable. Now this isn't to say that it's so bad that you shouldn't watch it. No, but it's just a little tough to see when Kirk eventually falls for her--I was really hoping he'd just put her over his knee and spank her for her utter rudeness. Plus, although Kirk falls in love with Elaan due to a chemical process for which McCoy says there is no cure, Kirk being the incredibly macho guy he is, is able to overcome this by the end of the episode.

12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Elaan of Troyius (TV Episode 1968)",One of my favorite TOS Episodes,"I know a lot of fans dislike most of Series 3 and some reviewers take issue with ""Kirk as white knight conquering the damsel"". But I tend to judge an episode on entertainment value and block-by-block performance from the cast. I think France Nuyen is a wonderful actor in this episode and totally dominates every scene she appears in. The first act sets up the conflict between Elas and Troyius, two feudalistic planets with the power to destroy each other, seeking to form a constructive alliance through the marriage of two royal families. And these two families couldn't be more different from each other. Troyius is obsessed with tradition and ""manners"" while Elas is as savage and brutal as we image the Roman barbarians were. The second act brings Kirk and Elaas closer together through a biological ""love potion"" and exposes the treachery of a trusted Elasian guard. Some reviewers do not like how the script transitions Elaan from ""shrew"" to ""compliant mistress"" but I disagree. I think Elaan was simply attempting to use the forced attraction she infected Kirk with initially for her own ends, but in the process discovered a man she felt was worthy of her love. As a princess on Elaas she was denied nothing. But on the Enterprise, she would discover that she could not have Kirk whether the attraction was physical or chemical. The third act brings in the Klingons! Perfect timing! I love the action and tactical maneuvering here and I think the script for Kirk, Spock, Sulu, and Scotty plays right on to strengths of each character. The final scenes are romantic and emotional. The classic line ""Are you out of your Vulcan mind!"" This is an episode that is foundational to the TNG and reboot episodes that would follow. I'm a fan from 1970 and although there are episodes I like better than others, the original series inspired me to become an engineer. But I wanted to be Spock because he was intelligent, loyal, and mostly un-emotional. I highly recommend this episode.",10

A few years later and this could have been classified as a poor episode of Space 1999.How any thinking Trek fan who appreciated the intelligence of the earlier episodes can like this is beyond me.It's badly written - some of the acting is beyond camp - and the production values are poor.

The marriage is expected to bring peace between the two warring planets, both members of the Federation. Elaan the Elasian is an arrogant, narcissistic woman who immediately starts quarreling with the Troyian ambassador. Kirk attempts to make peace between the two and teach Elaan some manners; he is affected chemically by coming into contact with her tears, bringing him under her spell. To complicate manners, a scorned lover has rigged the warp drive to blow and a Klingon vessel hangs around attempting to antagonize the Enterprise into starting a war or blowing itself up. Kirk must simultaneously deal with his feelings for Elaan while trying to outwit those pesky Klingons.Has there ever been a female passenger that Kirk hasn't wooed in one way or another? By season 3, I felt like Kirk's slept with half the galaxy. Anyways, this episode has me torn. I like the concept of it: Kirk falling for a woman he knows he has to let go for the stability of the galaxy at large. But I have a few major grievances with the episode itself.My main issue is with the moral this script seemingly gives us. Elaan is a rambunctious lady used to getting her way. She needs to be taught civility and how to act outside of her home world. So what does Kirk do? He threatens to spank her (sexual much?), calls her names, and slaps her around a bit. His basic mentality in this episode is that he needs to ""tame"" her. And, according to the script, he does just that as she falls for him. So it that our takeaway? Are we suppose to learn that women need to be hit and threatened for them to learn how to love us? Yikes...Then Kirk falls in love with her. That's a natural human emotion right? Wrong! She uses trickery and deception by using her magic tears to fool Kirk into loving her back. Heaven forbid he loves her for what she is! No, he has to be cajoled into it; he just can't help himself. But Kirk's a big, strong, smart man whose able to overcome her love potion that has been seducing men on her home world for years. He has a ship to attend to, she's just a one-night stand.I do really feel for Elaan in this episode. Sure, she's a jerk but I'd be pretty upset to if I was being taken to my people's enemy as a peace offering. She doesn't have much of a say in the matter and she knows it. She tries her best to get out of it but it's to no avail. Her character was the one enjoyable part of the episode; I would have liked to see her back. The inclusion of the Klingons in this episode made the script feel a bit overstuffed, like they added an unnecessary layer. Not my favorite episode.",3

It's an obligation of royalty, but not one that the hot blooded and quite spoiled princess wants to make. Watching this episode I was wondering if Daphne Zuniga borrowed some of France Nuyen's character for playing Princess Vespa in Spaceballs. As a Druish princess she had enough of the character, but not the powers.The women of Nuyen's planet do a little crying and if their tears touch the man they want, those men are hooked. To get what she wants Nuyen pouts and sobs on William Shatner's shoulder and that's it.

The Enterprise is the vehicle of transport by order of the Federation. She doesn't want to cooperate and Capt Kirk is caught in the middle between the Ambassador and the princess. She has a special power in the form of magic tears that she can use on men to get her way. The magic tears make any man fall hopelessly in love with her if the tears touch the guy - and there is no cure. Then she can manipulate the crap out of the poor sap to get whatever she can get.

For me, other than the usual variety of aliens, it's not so much science fiction as ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?"" Things get thrown. Screaming goes on. There is a stabbing.

In fact she is so strong willed that she attacks and nearly kills Petri leaving Kirk the job of teaching her how to behave. This is complicated by the fact that any man who touches the tears of a woman from Elas is doomed to fall in love with her; something Kirk doesn't learn until it is too late!

The story is pretty good with some amusing scenes between Kirk and Elaan leading up to so action when the Klingon's attack the damaged Enterprise. Jay Robinson is good as the refined Ambassador Petri; his pale green skin does make him a slightly comic character despite his otherwise ordinary behaviour. Few people will be surprised that Kirk ended up getting involved with Elaan; it was inevitable from the moment this beauty beamed aboard her metallic purple bikini-like costume only helped matters along!

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. The series didn't seem to mature as it should have but definitely has improved on terms of implementing smarter approach, parallel plot lines and thought provoking concept.Season 03Contrary to expectations, second season failed to project the essential character development which would have give a perfect arc to the series and instead focused on different cases. In this final season the expectations are still higher as they have somehow glued their audience with their gripping screenplay and innovative imagination that doesn't flinch on pushing the boundaries.Elaan Of TroyiusAn old foe returns for revenge which inherently spices things up which isn't utilized properly in here and the soft track of Captain Kirk slows things down and unfortunately never picks up to punch the viewers in the gut; contrary to expectations.",

That may be so but this particular episode is a favorite of mine because of Steve Ihnat's broad and somewhat overacted performance. This is not criticism of Ihnat but his part of former Starship commander Garth is a role that calls for it. Actors love playing crazy people because they can chew the scenery like mad and overact to the max and no one will criticize because that's what the part calls for.As Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock are about to embark on an away visit to a prison planet to deliver medical supplies, they suspect something isn't quite right. William Shatner arranges a code signal with James Doohan before he beams him and Leonard Nimoy back on board. That proved to be a wise precaution because when the two beam down the prison and it's a prison for the criminally insane. The warden/governor of the planet Keye Luke has been overthrown and Steve Ihnat has taken over.

But there's that signal code that Shatner arranged with Doohan. Can't do much until he's on the Enterprise.Ihnat completely takes over this story and dominates this episode. His performance is very similar to the one he gave in Madigan as an absolutely nuts criminal.

However, it is one of those guilty pleasures - much as I hesitate to admit it, I enjoy the histrionics here as Kirk & Spock enter the last insane asylum in the Federation (the loopy plot, involving eradication of all mental illness, is contradicted by such later TNG episodes as ""Sarek,"" where-in it's clear some Federation members still suffer incurable mental problems). We meet the former fleet captain (a rank attained during interstellar war?) Garth, portrayed by Ihnat, an actor with a strong screen presence who never attained much fame. Though he doesn't look much older than Kirk, it's established that he's from a previous generation of starship captains, a prototype on which Kirk and his peers based their training. Unfortunately, Garth's seen better days - check out his differently-colored boots. We also finally see the first Orion female (Craig, better known as 'Batgirl!') since ""The Menagerie"" - but, whoops, she's as crazy as Garth. Adding to the madness, Garth also possesses a talent for mimicry; implausibly, he can take on the appearance of anyone, down to their clothes, leading to one of those 'two Kirks for the price of one' scenes (see also ""The Enemy Within"" and ""What Are Little Girls Made Of?"").I wrote how I enjoy this episode and, yes, it's a cheap thrill. There are no profundities to be found here, no new ideas explored - it's strictly a thriller, seasoned with a flipped out tone. But it's this tone which makes it better than many of the boring 3rd season episodes. For most of the episode, we watch Kirk & Spock deal with a psychotic green dancing girl and listen to the rantings of the brain-damaged Garth regarding his deranged plans to take over the universe. However, Garth, it turns out, is not some harmless blowhard. He's apparently invented some explosive, proved by its use later, and the only thing stopping him from invading the Enterprise is a clever chess password invented by Kirk for this episode (convenient?). It is mentioned early in the episode that Garth was/is a genius. One wonders, as the story progresses, if a Garth who is out of his mind gives Kirk & Spock so much trouble, just how formidable would a sane Garth be? Luckily, he was one of the good guys. Ihnat gives a suitably magnetic, over-the-top performance as the insane leader, though he really shows what he was capable of in the moments when Kirk was able to break through Garth's madness very briefly.

Garth, or rather Lord Garth of Izar, is a former Federation starship captain, admired by Captain Kirk, and still read at Starfleet Academy for his cunning victory at Axanar.It's probably not very heartening to consider that mental illness still exists in the Star Trek future. What Roddenberry and his writers did here was clearly take another shot at self appointed elitists who believe only THEY can know what's right and necessary to rule a people and a society. Destroying anything that stands in their way is certainly appropriate, even if those they destroy are former friends and allies.Besides the story, I also got quite a kick out of seeing former Charlie Chan Number #1 Son Lee, that would be Keye Luke, over forty years after his participation in that 1930's film franchise. He always wound up in a quandary trying to help out his 'Pop', and would have to get set straight by the Oriental Detective. Luke also had a serious role as Master Po in the mid Seventies classic series 'Kung Fu', perhaps best known for calling his young ward 'grasshopper'.Notwithstanding my agreement with other reviewers on this board that Captain Kirk could have challenged Spock with a more definitive question while battling Garth, things still worked out satisfactorily. The ending was a bit anti-climactic considering Garth came out of his insanity treatment oblivious.

Instead, Spock's rapidly deteriorating season-3 logic tells him to let the two Kirks ""fight it out, the winner having to be the fake Kirk, because the real Kirk is too tired"".Most of this visually nice but dull/pointless episode consists of padding: Marta (the ""green bitch"" - Eddie Murphy) reciting poetry, Marta dancing, Marta getting blown up for no reason (but okay, they're all loonies, right?), Garth giving speeches, Kirk/Spock giving speeches...

Kirk and Spock, or course, won't tell him what it is, but the unstable Garth is ready to torture them both until they do.This episode suffers from a terribly nonsensical climax: Spock is faced with two Kirks, one the real one and one Garth in disguise. All he had to do was ask some question only he and his long-time pal Kirk would know the answer to. Instead, he allows himself to be hit on the head and lets the two Kirks duke it out. The script at this point just does not work, and serves only the rob the whole episode of dramatic tension: we're not going to be impressed by something that makes no sense.Still, the guest performances help keep the episode from collapsing entirely. Steve Inhat is just great as Garth. He's sauntering, hysterical, and violent, yet his view of the world as a place that needs a strongman is interesting to hear about and his histrionics a joy to watch. Yvonne Craig manages to be both creepy and sexy as the dangerous but beautiful Marta (apparently Marta's a serial killer). And the dinner scene where Garth extols his plans and desires to Kirk and Spock was great drama. Garth's maniacal ravings contrast wonderfully with Spock's calm, composed responses. Watching fascinating characters battle with differing opinions is always great TV. Too bad all of this fits into an episode where the script disintegrates.I can't help enjoying this episode because of the loopy fun of the guest stars. So I will give it a five out of ten. Like ""Plan Nine from Outer Space,"" it is not competent, but its giddy likability makes it entertaining enough.",5

Captain Garth is mentally ill and grandiose. He has taken over the asylum by his ability to shape- shift himself to look exactly like anyone he chooses.

Meanwhile Scotty and McCoy are up on the bridge, wringing their hands, knowing something is wrong, but powerless to intervene. Our heroes outsmart the bad guys and the final scene is a docile Garth receiving the treatment he needs, appearing to be much improved.Not a bad episode for Season 3.

Kirk and Spock are captured and Garth charges his appearance to look like Kirk as part of a plan to take the Enterprise luckily Kirk had arranged a pass code with Scotty so he isn't beamed up. He doesn't give up though; first he tries to force Kirk to give him the code then fellow inmate Marta, an attractive Orion girl, tries to seduce it out of him but she also fails he will have to try something more creative: will Kirk spot a fake Spock and can Spock tell which of two Kirks is the real one?This is a fairly fun episode for the most part; Steve Ihnat does a solid job as Garth, the self-styled 'Lord of the Universe' although the character is most amusing when imitating Kirk and William Shatner hams it up hilariously when Scotty refuses to beam him up to the Enterprise. Yvonne Craig is delightfully seductive as the green-skinned beauty Marta. The special effect where Garth changes appearance is rather weak but the scene where two Kirks fight is very impressive. The story does have a few unexplained details; most notably there is no explanation as to why Kirk set up a passcode before he was to be beamed up when he had no reason to suspect there might be a shape-shifter in the asylum and how did Garth create his super-explosive in the confines of the asylum.

Garth had passed himself off as Ensign Bloemker and then as Sean Finnegan, Kirk's old nemesis from his Academy days, in order to kill him, but he ended up failing miserably, due to Mr. Spock's interference.

He worked with what he was given.Garth can change shape, but I think he can also control minds. Watch each time he shape shifts, the whole screen goes black for a moment. In other words, he can shape shift, but he controls people's minds to make them think he's wearing the appropriate clothing....The final scene *was* written where Spock asks an intelligent question, but at this point each ep was ending with a fight between Kirk and somebody, so they just had to do it that way... it's just too bad we couldn't see Ihnat and Shatner fighting, I'd loved to have seen that! How about the fact that people on the colony need a password to beam up? I explain that in my fanfiction of this ep - obviously whenever the Enterprise is at a penal colony or an insane asylum, a password will be needed....Why Garth didn't just have Kirk and Spock knocked unconscious, lower the force field, and *be* Kirk when the rescue party beamed down, so that they'd bring him back up to the ship.... well, that's a plot for another fan fiction. ; )",7

Captain Garth, a former starfleet captain, does a good job of acting as the lunatic inmate's leader in trying to trick Captain Kirk in revealing the password for beaming aboard the Enterprise. Kirk shows he has matured since his last visit at a penal colony by instituting a password system to prevent any inmates from beaming aboard the Enterprise. We also see a convincing and frightening portrayal of mental illness by Martha, the Orion dancer, who seems sane at first but then later attempts to stab Kirk with her knife saying ""I kill the people I love."" However, the resolution of the episode was a downer. Spock escapes from the clutches of Garth's guards and enters the control room where he encounters 2 Kirks--one his captain and the other the shape shifting Garth. But Spock is made to appear stupid when he poses the question to them: ""What maneuver did we use to defeat the Romulan vessel near Tao Seti""? One of the Kirks says: 'The Cochran Decelartion' while the other Kirk interjects and immediatedly says this solution is a classic battle maneuver which every Starfleet captain knows. And Spock is forced to agree...and hold his fire? A real Vulcan would have asked a more probing question such as what was Kirk's nickname for McCoy--Bones--or what did Kirk say at such an event. Garth would never have known the answer to this question. Then Spock gets hit on the head by Garth (in Kirk's disguise) and lets the two Kirk's get involved in a fight which lasts for about 1 minute. Spock only resolves the problem--and shoots the illusory Kirk (Garth here)--when the real Kirk pleads with Spock to shoot both of use to ""save the Enterprise."" A highly unsatisfying ending. We get a touching and powerful scene when Garth--who has been given his new Stafleet medicines--later turns to Kirk and asks him...""Do I know you, sir?"" since we see that Garth is not a really wicked man...just one who has fallen into bad times. Unfortunately it doesn't do much to restore the show's dignity especially when Kirk--at the episode's ending--chides Spock for not being able to distinguish between the real and illusory Kirk and says King Solomon would never allow himself to be hit on the head. This speaks directly to the poor execution of the film. But, at least, the show was fun and eminently watchable.",7

When Kirk and Spock beam down to deliver the potion, things aren't exactly how they are supposed to be. ""Lord"" Garth and the other patients have taken over the asylum, locking up the head doctor.

The rest of the episode is Garth trying to sneak onto the Enterprise while Kirk and Spock try to figure out how to gain control of the asylum.This episode recalled to my mind an old Edgar Allan Poe short story: The System of Doctor Tarr & Professor Fether. In it, the patients of an asylum take over control and pretend to be the doctors while forcing the doctors to become their patients. An unwary traveler visits the mental hospital and doesn't realize the truth until the end of the story. The opening of the episode mirrors this plot (although the subsequent events are completely different). But the concept on display in this episode is not a new one, it has been terrifying people for generations.I find it infeasible that there are only a dozen or so ""criminally insane"" people left in the galaxy. That's what this episode claims but I find it far-fetched. Regardless, this is the plot we have to deal with. The episode really drags at certain points. There is a lot of filler involving party scenes and monologues. It's all very slow moving.Scotty and Bones have nothing to do in this episode! They're just up there twittling their thumbs while the episode happens down on the surface.

He is a total narcissist, caring only for himself and using the other patients for his own purposes. This pretty much forces Kirk and Spock to deal with a totally irrational man. They must decide life and death situations concerning the other patients and bear the cruelty of Garth. The end is a bit anticlimactic and pulls some of Garth's responsibility off the table.

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. The series didn't seem to mature as it should have but definitely has improved on terms of implementing smarter approach, parallel plot lines and thought provoking concept.Season 03Contrary to expectations, second season failed to project the essential character development which would have give a perfect arc to the series and instead focused on different cases.

He does overact as he spews his venomous hatred to anyone within earshot (anyone within a light year, it seems like), but it's a curiously appropriate performance - apropos the wild, irrational tone put on display for the taken aback Enterprise crew. Bele grits his teeth, chews up phaser blasts, and appears ready to hurl physical bile past his abused larynx due to so many years of pent-up fury (very many years, it's revealed - see below). The crew, of course, are well evolved beyond the petty prejudices we see here and so we see things from their aghast perspective. Bele is, for purposes of this story, the half-black: the upper class establishment figure of his alien planet, used to putting certain people in their place. But, the story doesn't take sides; Lokai, the half-white - the pursued lower class persecuted figure - doesn't come off looking any better. He seems most content being the center of attention, displays similar prejudice against mono-colored peoples and probably wouldn't mind sacrificing thousands of his 'followers' if it made him look heroic in the end. Though a product of the relevant sixties, this hasn't dated as much as one would think.There's a reason, by default, that this episode may not rate higher: with no one to root for, the story lacks a focal point or someone we can relate to. We listen to both Bele & Lokai angrily espouse their views throughout the episode, reminding us of various speeches by political leaders, but, in the end, it all comes off as pointless ranting and babbling - neither one is worth listening to. It's a 'message' episode, watch out. And, in this case, the message seems to be that if you're filled with hate, you'll end up running around the Enterprise corridors to no purpose. That's it, after 50,000 years? I would've preferred a number of 50 years or even 50 centuries, but, according to this episode, these two guys have been running around the galaxy since Cro-magnon man first developed on Earth. I suppose this extreme length of time was meant to stress the futility of their irrational hatred or to lend a cosmic slant to their never-ending antagonism, but come on, Trek. So these guys are immortal, have personal force shields and Bele can control the ship with his mind. Were all their race so accomplished? We'll never know. This episode does have the marvelous self-destruct sequence initiated by Kirk, in which Spock & Scotty join in to voice the self-destruct codes. This sequence manages to squeeze out every bit of suspense possible for such a televised few minutes and foreshadows the now-famous sequence later duplicated in the 3rd Trek film, ""The Search For Spock."" Knowing what we do now about that movie, the countdown to doom in this episode is all the more chilling.",6
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Let That Be Your Last Battlefield (TV Episode 1969)","One of the Best Star Trek Episodes is not as ""Black and White"" as It Appears","This episode has been criticized because it seems its main point is applied with a sledge hammer. And yet, if you watch the episode carefully, there are subtle hints that there's a lot of blur about what its ultimate message could be. The Starship Enterprise has inadvertently crossed paths with two alien beings who have been at odds for 50,000 years, Lokai and Bele. A shuttlecraft was stolen from a Starbase 4 and the Enterprise is in pursuit. They use a tractor beam to ""rescue"" the shuttlecraft and a strange humanoid who is black on one side and white on the other. His name is Lokai and he said he ""borrowed"" the shuttlecraft to escape a commissioner from the planet Cheron who has been pursuing him. When McCoy examines him, he determines that Lokai would be regarded as a superhuman when compared to average humans from Earth.Shortly thereafter another humanoid obviously from the same planet appears on the Enterprise, Bele. He says the Enterprise holds ""precious cargo"": Lokai. Bele also has the same trait of having a black side and white side. We learn that Bele regards Lokai as of an inferior race and that Lokai's ""people"" were destroying their civilization. By contrast, Lokai contends that Bele's people enslaved his people. Bele also demonstrates abilities far above those of earth humans. When the difference between the two is finely revealed, Kirk and Spock are somewhat flabbergasted as to the characteristic which distinguishes the individuals.While this story device of humanoids with a black side and a white side may appear to be an obvious commentary on contemporary racial relations, the story does well to keep from portraying one side as being ""right"" and the other ""wrong"". Lokai's claims his people were oppressed by the people represented by Bele may at first seem like the obvious choice for our sympathies. But then we learn that Lokai's people engaged in destruction on a mass scale. He also continually admonishes the crew for not carrying out justice because they are not willing to kill Bele. Simultaneously Bele believes he is pursuing not only Lokai but justice and that his apprehension of Lokai represents the greater symbolic rightness of ""justice"".This is a subtle story if you examine its depth. Its not really about who was right or wrong in terms of the ""facts"" of who was more or less oppressed and/or who was more destructive. The final message is that no matter which point of view may be right, the real villain is the hate which emerges from the conflict. And as the final scenes attest, hate becomes the overriding destructive force which may be the unintended consequence of pursuing justice, however that is defined.",10

One is in pursuit of the other, attempting to legally apprehend him (legally, according to his view of things). Kirk gets fed up with them, telling them to knock it off. Not only does this not happen, they gain control of the Enterprise and it takes Kirk bringing the ship to near destruction to dissuade them (at least temporarily) from their racist activities. Without ruining the ending, it reminds me of those stubborn Dr. Seuss characters who pride themselves on the most insignificant physical traits. At the end, the Sneetches can't remember how each of them was different. These guys go down that road. In some ways rather precious; in others a bit of profundity.",7

I rate it as one of the best season three episodes and its still a great watch today if you have never seen it. Gorshin is the establishment (interestingly referred here as ""the Black"" by his nemesis because of the color on his right side, which is probably another statement alluding to the right being conservative) and he is a chasing another of his race who is anti establishment and also a different skin color (he's white on his right side). Rascism is the tone the episode mainly takes, but you can see other parallels with the 60's generation rising up against ""The Man"" here as well. Excellent episode to watch. Now for some cheap nit picking, when Kirk is issuing the self destruct, Gorshin's character only had to knock him out, than he can't give the command, right? OK that was too easy, how about the way to save money by using an ""invisble"" alien space ship, that was pretty lame. Despite those two gaffs that I saw, the aliens here are pretty cool, with personal force fields and life spans of over 50,000 years. To bad they didn't study the 1990's LA riots history and know that we all just need to get along.

Roddenberry and his co-writers skewer racism in the story, and manage to turn the concept on it's head with a brilliantly clever twist. Though on the surface, Bele (Frank Gorshin) and Lokai (Lou Antonio) appear to be of the same race, they are obviously at war with each other because their coloration forms a mirror image of each other.The episode achieves absurd proportions when Bele proclaims to his nemesis - ""You're dead, you half-white""! It's at this point that the viewer either 'gets' it, or doesn't. The inherent nature of racism is entirely wrong headed and unsupportable by any logical rationale. If you were to strip away any of the physical features that define people, whether color, race, nationality, sex or what have you, you have no basis for fear and hate. Imagine if everyone in the world were blind. On what pretext would one be able to base his hatred for another person? On top of the racial component, the episode also offers that intriguing smack down between Captain Kirk and Bele over the fate of the Enterprise. The destruct sequence by itself would have made for a great episode, but here it's part of a larger story. In fact, it gave Bele one more opportunity to bring his prejudice into the equation by declaring to Kirk - ""You can no more destroy this ship than I can change color"". Brilliantly played.However there was one thing that obviously contradicted continuity in the story. It was mentioned that the shuttle-craft Lokai arrived in was stolen from Starbase 4. Yet when it landed in the hangar of the Enterprise, it clearly showed the call numbers of the Enterprise itself - NCC 1701-7. It seems to me this could have been easily avoided by changing the numbers, so I wonder why no one thought of it. Maybe by that time, cast and crew might have gone color blind.",9

Basically 2 aliens--Bele and Lokai--repeatedly fight on the Enterprise with the use of forcefields and other infernal devices with neither side gaining an upper hand. They are so filled with hatred for one another that they cannot stop quarreling and turn the Enterprise into their own 'battlefield.' Captain Kirk is compelled to travel to their original home only to discover that both Bele and Lokai's native planet of Cheron have been totally destroyed by their racial conflict--and no human life exists. Indeed, the planet is so desolate that animals are even encroaching into the planet's now empty city centres, notes Spock from his sensor scans. The repeated emphasis of Bele and Lokai running around the battleship and attacking one another just demeans the seriousness of the topic on racism. It is much too heavy handed to be taken seriously. If the episode had been played more subtly, its effectiveness could have been more substantial. Basically, the show had a good premise but extremely poor execution. The makeup is also below average but at least the producers had a good excuse here--NBC's serious cutbacks in Star Trek's budget. There are a few good lines such as the scene where Spock tells Bele that his planet was once a violent world which the Vulcans eventually resolved through logic and cool reasoning. Bele, however, is much too irrational to make peace with his arch-enemy Lokai or to settle on a new life other than his native Cheron.",6

The crew isn't sure why they hate each other so much and are shocked to hear that the reason they hate so much is OBVIOUS--one is white on the right side while the other is white on the left! The very conclusion of the episode when both escape is extremely fitting and well-done.I've heard some people praise this episode because it addressed race relations and this is true and quite commendable. The problem is that despite its plot, the show is pretty dull and the way racial prejudice is handled seems a tad heavy-handed.

Kirk reminds Bele that the Federation has no treaty with them and once the Enterprise is done with their mission they will take them to a Federation base to settle this matter. Then Bele takes over the ship telepathically, to Cheron they go. Now Kirk has to get his ship back and do something with the two black and white unknown species of aliens.Lokai's right side is white and left side is black while Bele's face is just the opposite - that gives the viewers an idea which one is evil, which one is good; which one is possibly a ruler/police which is possibly slave. Which is telling the truth which is lying.An episode that has intense moments executed very well - even though you know everything will be okay in the end. And it's great to see Frank Gorshin outside of the role as The Riddler.9/10",9

Still this episode has a goofy charm that the old Star Trek series would somehow be less if this episode hadn't been made. It's a kind of so bad it's good episode.The two guest stars in their cheap black&white make-up (you could tell they were scraping the barrel of the budget for the show by this time) steal the show with their constant hating of each other while the Enterprise crew does very little except watch and make self-righteous comments. This episode is a time capsule of sorts because it is very much a part of its time as the settings of many Sci-Fi stories of the 50s&60s were often just thinly-disguised commentaries about social conditions and human nature. Writers of such stories were more interested in the message than in fleshing out a story universe that made sense.""Let This Be Your Last Battlefield"" though is enjoyable fare to sit back and enjoy and not to be surprised by the inevitable obvious ending. What makes it even more delightful is the appearance of Frank Gorshin, Jr famous for playing The Riddler in the 60s Batman series as one of the illogical hate-fueled aliens.",6

Kirk: ""That's hardly what interests me, though. What I really wanna know is whether your women's breasts are two-coloured like your faces.""LTBYLB is yet another episode that presents us with a child-like analogy to various 20th-century/60s issues such as slavery, racism, war, class conflict... yawn. Besides, don't we have enough politicians already covering that ground, boring and annoying us all to bits? Black-white and White-black have come from planet ""Unemployed Mimes"", hence their dialogue is rusty, them being used more to miming than talking: very much extremely naive-sounding and consisting almost entirely of speeches and political sound bites which even Martin Luther King, Kennedy and Gandhi would have rejected as being too bombastic. BW and WB look and sound corny every step of the way. Both BW and WB look silly, that much is clear, but the Riddler (WB) moves his body in very goofy ways, which only adds to the camp level. Check out the absurd/affected way in which he runs during the last scenes of the episode. The two good aspects of this episode: 1) Kirk's order for self-destruction. It would seem that the somewhat sleepier Season 3 Kirk had finally woken up from his semi-slumber. (The way he was developing, i.e. regressing, Kirk would have become even worse than peace-loving Prickard by the time a hypothetical Season 6 had been shot.) On the other hand, I wasn't sufficiently convinced of the logic of the Riddler being able to steer the ship, and yet - at first - being unable to override the computer which receives Kirk's orders for self-destruction. 2) I liked the idea that WB and BW are the only remaining survivors on planet ""Mime"", hence would spend an eternity chasing each other on such a desolate place. (This reminds somewhat of the resolution in ""The Alternative Factor"".)Locki: ""He represents a brutal and tyrannical regime, and-"" Kirk: ""That stuff is too boring. What I'd rather know is what happens when your two races mix. Do you get a black or white child? And if it's all-white does it avoid the black breast, and if all-black does it avoid sucking from the white breast? Or do opposites attract at that early development stage of toddler-mimes i.e. do they suck the opposite-colour tit?""In one scene, WB tries to insult Kirk and Co. by saying he had heard that ""humans had evolved from apes"". Of course, he's only partially right: Christian fundamentalists, as we all know, had been created 6,000 years ago out of thin air. The rest of us have ape-cousins.",
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Let That Be Your Last Battlefield (TV Episode 1969)",Prophetic,"I think it's safe to say that this is one of the greatest episodes of Star Trek ever. Sadly, it is also a prophetic commentary on the present state of the human race. Three hundred years ago, Jonathan Swift wrote in Gulliver's Travels about the Big-endians and the Little-endians, making war over which end of an egg to break before eating it. In 1969 the Cold War was raging, the somewhat peaceful manifestation being the race to the moon, and the bloody manifestation being Vietnam. The civil rights battle was ongoing, and the feminist movement was gathering steam. In 2006, the Cold War is long over, but now the ""war on terror"" has taken its place. Racism is still alive and well. With the current debate over immigration and the use of English as the official language of the United States, we manage to find even more ways to distinguish ourselves from ""the other"". We have Red States vs. Blue States, black vs. white, Anglo vs. Hispanic, Catholic vs. Protestant, liberal vs. conservative, gay vs. straight, pro-choice vs. pro-life, evolution vs. creationism. Some of these conflicts have resulted in bloodshed, others haven't, but they continue to divide us. Worldwide, it's no longer just Christian vs. Jew or Muslim vs. Hindu. In many cases our conflicts involve Christian vs. Christian, as in Northern Ireland or Muslim vs. Muslim, as in Iraq. The worldwide Anglican Communion threatens to split in two over the appointment of a gay bishop. Someone once said there are two kinds of people in the world, those who classify everybody into two kinds, and those who don't. I suspect the latter group is thinning out. God help us.",6
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Let That Be Your Last Battlefield (TV Episode 1969)",Predictable but still engaging,"This is a surprisingly decent episode of Star Trek in an otherwise quickly declining third season. There is nothing glaringly wrong or annoying with this episode, but also nothing especially new or suspenseful. The Enterprise stumbles on two alien humanoids locked in eternal battle; both from the same species but with a slight skin difference that has created the prejudice behind the battle they are carrying out which is representative of the battle being carried out between their races back on their home planet. Despite the plot being well-worn and predictable, this episode is surprisingly watchable due to decent acting and musical scoring. The problems I see that this episode has: 1) The black/white makeup for the aliens is just awful. That's not skin. That's cheap paint applied clumsily. It would have looked at lot more real if they had gotten two white actors and sun-tanned half of the face.2) Upon rescuing the first black/white alien, Kirk and McCoy go on and on about how alien he really is, how he must have come from some unknown star system and be a mutant. But then this alien gains consciousness and immediately speaks perfect American English. This was very jarring and made the whole wow-he's-so-alien bit look silly. I know this happens in almost every episode, but it was especially bad in this scene. At the very least the actor could have faked an exotic accent like in other episodes.3) As soon as you see the aliens have their first contentious exchange you just know that the message is going to be that prejudice is bad and symmetrical war just leads to mutual destruction. Despite being predictable and forced, this message still has value.4) Kirk and the crew really didn't do much this episode. They just watched the two aliens lock horns and waited for them to self-destruct.",6

And while the message is very overt, and even a bit campy in it's execution, I still look at this as one of the most influential Star Trek episodes I ever saw.I first saw it as a third or fourth grader in afternoon reruns in the 70s. Having had absolutely no experience with any sort of racism that I was aware of at that point in my young life, the entire episode struck me as silly that people could or even would act that way for what was obviously so little of an actual difference. Further thinking about it, and discussions with my school teacher mother about the episode were very enlightening to my young mind.I imagine that for adults at the time the episode aired (or even now), the episode really does come across as campy, preachy and overt.

13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Let That Be Your Last Battlefield (TV Episode 1969)",Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,"""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"" examines race relations and two alternate viewpoints, both sides extremely devoted to their causes, hate driving everything they now do. The two alien lifeforms, Bele (Frank Gorshin) and Lokai (Lou Antonio) from a planet, Sharon, located in an uncharted galaxy, represent different sides of a conflict regarding slavery and cruelty, the rise against being enslaved: Lokai has evaded Bele's capture so long because he speaks for those who were under rule, under slavery, mistreated and considered inferior, a message that could or could not be true yet effective enough to garner sympathy every place he has been to. Bele does indicate a superiority complex for his people and when he speaks, there is a sense that he considers his race on the Sharon planet as superior to Lokai's. You see, Lokai and Bele have one side of their face black and the other white: it is just that Bele has black on the right side and Lokai on the left. All of the death and hate that exists over a matter of the slight difference in skin pigmentationsounds familiar, doesn't it? Yep, this is definitely a message episode without a hint of subtlety. I think we go one step further and say Bele and Lokai represent sides of any opposing party/viewpoint. Both sides so set in their ways, Democrat/Republican, Conservative/Liberal, Pro-Life/Pro-Choice, whatever the argument is for/against, the results are often hostile and angry as intelligent conversation, a method of communication, trying to find a way to bridge the large gap that exists between two ideals, the results of ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"" are rather apt and authentic: hate too often exterminates the ability to put aside hard feelings and embrace a peaceful solution to a long-term problem that hasn't accomplished anything. This episode will prove too political, its message too loud and preachy for many, but I do think it is worth telling. While this is a designed message episode, Trek fans will likely find the most memorable scene to be Bele's control over the ship stunted by Kirk's psychological cat and mouse by using auto-destruct as a means to get power turned back over to him. We also see the strain and stress Kirk is under dealing with these two; he does not like to see The Enterprise used as a pawn in a duel between two aliens who have been at war for so long. Kirk tries to be diplomat, as does Spock who mentions his planet Vulcan was almost rendered extinct because of war. It is all futile because Bele and Lokai are unable to listen, too far gone, too blinded by the hate that guides them.",7

It's a fascinating insight into mindless racial hatred and only ""bogs down"" a bit in the middle. Could have also been written by Dr. Seuss as it brings to mind his fable of ""Sneetches with and without stars"" (who are better?). Two beings exactly alike in every way except one has a left white face with the right side black and the other is exactly the opposite. One is the master race and one is the slave race. Both have super-powers and can control the Enterprise. You get the idea. All theories are suggested by Spock including nature vs. nurture. Their hated has outlasted the population of their planet. The only writing flaw is their hatred spans thousands of years. Nobody lives than long, except the ""Q"" maybe! A fitting ""1960's episode"". Frank Gorshin channels his inner ""Kirk Douglas"" as he was an amazing impressionist as well. A brilliant performance as ""Commissioner Bele"" in pursuit of a ""filthy-right sided white face"" criminal whom he believes caused the uprising on planet Cheron"".

It is brought aboard and a strange alien emerges; his left side is white, his right side is black. He identifies himself as Lokai and states that he is fleeing persecution on the planet Cheron. Spock and McCoy state that they believe his appearance must be due to a unique mutation a theory is soon disproved when another ship appears carrying a very similar alien although this one, who identifies himself as Bele, is black on the left and white on the right. Bele states that Lokai is a traitor he has been pursuing for fifty thousand years! It soon becomes apparent that on Cheron those whose left side is white are considered a lesser race while those who are white on the right dominate. Bele insists that Kirk takes them both back to Cheron and when Kirk refuses he uses a telepathic power to force steer the Enterprise towards his home planet something Kirk is determined to stop; even if that means destroying his ship.The racial message of this episode is handled in an interesting way; to the viewer and the Enterprise's crew the two aliens look almost the same; which side of their bodies are black and which are white is irrelevant however to them it is everything. Once that is realised the message that such racism is ridiculous is a little heavy handed but that doesn't really matter as the message is still valid. The ending proved to be rather interesting as they avoided the cliché of having the two realise the stupidity of seeing trivial differences as reasons to hate; instead we see where the hate led their civilisation as their chase goes on. On the down side the idea that these two have been hunter and hunter for 50,000 years is crazy to say the least. The acting is solid enough with guest stars Lou Antonio and Frank Gorshin doing good jobs as Lokai and Bele. Overall an okay episode which is memorable as 'the one with the black and white aliens'.",7

In its simplicity it was able to point out exactly what it was all about and to this day the episode is still heralded as a testament to what makes Star Trek so enduring.""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"" is ridiculous! The hokey story of two men from a race the federation has yet to make first contact with battling each other across the endless void of space for 50,000 years because one is black on the right side while the other is black on the left side is absurd, and that is precisely what makes this episode so good. It took the story of race relations in the United States and pointed it out for all the world to see how preposterous the whole idea is. Our characters treat the story with the seriousness it deserves, but the viewer is treated to just how stupid the whole thing is. Our antagonists Lokai and Commissioner Beale cannot see the idiocy of their endeavor to destroy one another, but to the viewer it is plainly obvious and is proven during the goofy (intentional or not) running scene at the end of the episode giving us all the evidence we need. The only thing left to do is to turn that gaze towards ourselves to see just how ridiculous we are. The story may be as subtle as a punch in the gut, but that was the objective.

All jokes aside, yes, it is a bit on the nose... but I can't help enjoying it a bit. There is some bizarre directional choices on display here: the odd zoom, the running sequences, the (very cool) close-up facial reaction shots. It keeps things exciting when the plot drags on a bit.

With a strong anti-abortion theme, and the Gideon Council Elder (David Hurst) proclaiming life sacred and love of life the greatest gift, the idea that his own daughter (Sharon Acker) would submit to a radical experiment to adjust the planet's life cycle sounded entirely contradictory. In this case, the 'adjustment' desired amounted to introducing a virus to the blood stream of young volunteers, thereby nullifying the effect of the Gideons' long life span, in effect reducing the overpopulation of the planet. But that flew in the face of Hodin's own ideas about life being the greatest gift. The whole thing just didn't make sense.On top of that, you had the comical representation of the population of Gideon, herding like cattle in a limited space, and looking every bit like the forerunners of the Blue Man Group, except they weren't wearing blue as far as I could tell. Opposed to violence and warfare, Hodin's two henchmen didn't have any problem attacking Captain Kirk when he got just a little too logical.The one thing that stood out for me in this story was Spock's comment about the purpose of diplomacy - that being to prolong a crisis. He could have been talking about the Israeli-Palestinian problem just as well back in 1969, because that issue is still going on today. Anyway, with most other Star Trek episodes, even if they weren't very good, they generally managed to establish some kind of continuity from start to finish. This one just keeps looping around in my mind as annoyingly contradictory with a resolution that was anything but.",6
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Mark of Gideon (TV Episode 1969)",An interesting commentary on 1960s (and 2000s) culture,"While ""The Mark of Gideon"" was not the greatest Star Trek episode, if you look beyond the poorly written plot you'll find something more interesting.Recall the U.S. cultural and political climate in 1969 when this episode aired. (I'm dating myself here.) The feminist or ""women's liberation"" movement was in full swing, as was the sexual revolution. Abortion was illegal in most states. The Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion was four years in the future. Then, as now, a fierce debate raged between those who held that a woman had the right to control her own body and those who held that all life is sacred.At one point in the episode, Hodin, the Gideon ambassador, and Kirk confront each other about solving Gideon's overpopulation problem. Kirk offers Hodin the Federation's assistance with contraceptive medicines and education about how to avoid having children. Hodin counters that the Gideonites love and revere life so much that even to prevent new life from starting would be unthinkable. Of course, deliberate murder or warfare is equally out of the question.Thus, ""The Mark of Gideon"" is -- as many Star Trek episodes were -- a thinly disguised commentary on 1960s culture and politics; the sexual debates in this case, with Kirk pro-choice and Hodin pro-life. The episode points out the logical end result of an extreme pro-life position -- massive overpopulation. The episode also displays the irony in the life-loving Gideonites resorting to introducing a fatal disease into the population in order to solve their overpopulation problem.Forty years later, the same pro-life/pro-choice debate still rages. We continue to make great strides in conquering disease. Perhaps someday we, like germ-free Gideon, will have a planet where no one dies of sickness; where human longevity is greatly increased. Will our entire planet end up with wall-to-wall people, like Gideon? What will we do about it? Star Trek is as relevant today as it was then.",6

Gideon is rumored to be a paradise but no one in the Federation knows the details. The planet's leaders insist that Kirk beam down by himself, which he does. However, he seems to end up back on an empty Enterprise, wondering where his crew has disappeared to. Unfortunately, this intriguing mystery has a most mundane explanation; it has nothing to do with Kirk entering another dimension or being out of sync, as I hoped when I first saw this as a kid. Most of the episode concerns Spock and the bridge crew dealing with bureaucracy from both Gideon and Starfleet. Even they look bored - how can they expect the audience to get excited? Kirk, meanwhile, spends most of the episode wandering on the other, empty Enterprise, along with a young female who shows up unexpectedly. Expectedly, it's an even more dull sequence of scenes. Every few scenes, a collection of sober, droopy faces pop up on this Enterprise's view-screens; this was meant to be startling or ominous. It doesn't really make sense, is all.There also isn't much sense to this elaborate scheme concocted by Gideon's policy-makers. They wanted Kirk down on their planet for a certain reason; there was no need for all the grand subterfuge. Once Kirk beamed down, they could have sat him down in any room for an hour or so with another inhabitant to get their plan to succeed. So, it's all a contrivance as far as the plot. Likewise, Spock and the crew are too slow on the uptake in figuring out the bogus coordinates: '..079' vs. '..709' - Spock didn't notice the discrepancy immediately? This is a Vulcan! Hello? Like with many later Trek episodes (in the 3rd season), the show aimed for heavy-handed relevance to tackle social issues and rising problems of the sixties: racism, war, pollution, inequality and, in this case, overpopulation. Once Gideon's problem is revealed, it is an admittedly interesting dilemma, taken to a logical extreme (later, ""Soylent Green"" in '73 would tackle the issue in a similar manner). But, it's a real slog to get there. This episode also has a shot (two, actually) of the empty bridge, previously seen (attention trivia Trekkers) in ""This Side of Paradise.""

Surely, Kirk should have sensed some kind of a trap immediatedly. The Enterprise crew can't locate their captain who doesn't materialize where he is supposed to--in the Gideonite council chambers--and are concerned that his life is in danger. But Spock doesn't notice at once that the beam down coordinates the Gideonites gave for Kirk is different from the ones they sent to the Enterprise to beam up a member of the Gideon council later? Any normal crewman would have quickly checked the coordinates and noticed the discrepancy between 079 and 709 and that the Gideonites have deliberately altered the numbers. Several Trek characters move out of their previous characterization with Spock and Kirk appearing less intelligent than they really are. Frankly, this is unforgivable.The scenes of Kirk with Odona on the empty duplicate copy of the Enterprise on Gideon also don't make much sense especially when you consider that the planet is supposed to be chronically overpopulated. The Gideon council chamber created so much free space for one man when they could have solved their overpopulation problem by having Kirk transport Odona to Dr. McCoy's sickbay for treatment? There is little logic to this show or its script. The Mark of Gideon is one of the subpar shows of season 3--not as horrendous as The Way to Eden--but still bad nevertheless. There is a memorable line which Spock says when Starfleet and its officials refuse to give him permission to beam down to Gideon and locate Kirk: ""Diplomats and bureaucrats may function differently but they achieve exactly the same results."" So, Spock himself has to violate a Starfleet directive to save Kirk. At least, that action was logical and highlights his loyalty to the captain. Odona was a wonderful actor--and a good foil for captain Kirk even though their romance has little basis in fact. I guess Kirk's libido was in overdrive in season 3 of TOS. It was not unreasonable for Odona to offer to sacrifice herself and 'die young' in order to let her civilization survive. A noble idea...even if Kirk was left with the short end of the stick by being a guinea pig who supplies a deadly virus to stop Gideon's chronic overpopulation. Most of the episode's scenes are imaginatively written if one excludes the preposterous image of hundreds of anonymous Gideonites crowding the exterior of the Gideonite Council. The touching scenes between Hodin and his dying daughter Odona was well done. Overall, Hodin, Odona, Kirk and Spock's performance elevate the show to a 4 out of 10 rating in my view--still a failure but not a total disaster. If season 3 of Star Trek had a proper film budget, the producers could have had the sets to properly depict Gideon and avoided all the numerous plot holes. Pity!",4
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Mark of Gideon (TV Episode 1969)",When Kirk gets abducted by Catholics...,"TMOG has one of the most absurd, illogical plot-lines in all of 60s ST. An over-populated planet of near-immortals, who are supposedly a bright/advanced population, cannot think of a better way to solve the problem than by dying from meningitis. I guess no-one in Starfleet carried Ebola or the plague, huh? (No rats on the Enterprise? Ships usually have them, though...) Ebola and the plague would have been so much more effective; no need for kissing at all; just say ""hello"" and watch your friend die. These Gideonians are so daft that they never considered the possibility of colonizing other planets! Of course, in order for that to happen they'd need a Starfleet spacecraft to land, to pick them up. But there's no free landing space on Gideon because every inch is covered by silly Gideonians (do they sleep like horses, standing up?), dressed like Woody Allen's ""Everything You Always Wanted..."" sperm, having to smell each other's armpits from very close proximity. But no matter... I think Starfleet could still have landed several spacecraft on Gideon, randomly splotching several hundred luckless Gideonians, making pancakes out of them. After all, if they're willing to catch a disease for their own kind, then I'm sure they wouldn't mind the comparatively painless demise of being instantly turned into Pizza-Gideonians. Naturally, beaming them up would be easier and death-free, but something tells me that Gideonians would not opt for that: they seem to have a penchant for overly complicated ways of resolving problems. Very much roundabout and around the bush, instead of going head-on into the bush.Can you get any more roundabout in solving a problem than wasting time, SPACE, and effort in making an exact replica of the Enterprise, just so you can confuse one man enough to make him salivate his bacteria into a girl's mouth? Gideon's government officials must have known that Kirk always uses plenty of tongue action on all his space floozies, hence the quick spread of germs.When Kirk asks them why they don't use condoms and other neat stuff to cut down on the babies, Gideon's Prime Minister tells him that ""for us life is sacred"". Who'd think the Catholic faith would make it that deep into the galaxy and that far into the future?? And yet, very strange Catholics they are; the Prime Minister pimps his own daughter just so Kirk can fall in love with her! What kind of Catholic behaviour is THAT? Are these the Space Borgias we've all been frightened of finding out about? Would the sequel reveal that she slept with her famous father??If they wanted Kirk's blood that badly (and I'm sure many rabid Trekkies could be included here: they'd wear it around their necks like Anjelina Jolie), then why didn't they just ask him nicely to donate a half-liter? (Never mind the fact the whole ST universe has the same blood types.) For all I know, these advanced Space Catholics have at least several bats still hanging around their sad little planet. They could have hired those creatures at a minimum wage to suck blood from Kirk while he was drugged or something, and then let him go back to Spock and McCoy, a little dazed, but saving himself having to kiss that anorexic stick, plus saving Spock the trouble of having to play a diplomat.""Diplomacy only succeeds in prolonging a crisis"". Amen to that, Spock! Just tell that to all those bleedin'-heart liberals... It's nice to see a less pacifistic Spock in Season 3, at least when it comes to his unique brand of philosophy. The episodes in which they almost made him out to be a hippie were very annoying. Spock would rather just get on with it, instead of wasting time negotiating with terrorists and kidnappers. A scientific mind is a practical mind.TMOG begs one essential question: if the planet is so extremely densily populated, does that mean that every time a Gideonian f**ts, twenty of them scream for fresh air?Nevertheless, I am amazed how many of these Trekkies nitpick with this episode. I consider TMOG to be one of the better shows. It's not the logic that counts, it's that 60s cheesy feel that ST brings to the table. Besides, the story may be totally implausible, but at least there was an attempt at something original, instead of serving us with yet another bad ""switcheroo"" episode (""Turnabout Intruder"", ""The Man Trap"") or aliens/enemies with absurdly infinite powers (""By Any Other Name"", ""And the Children Shall Lead"", Charlie X""). TMOG is pure sci-fi, unlike almost any episode of ""The Next Generation"", which is merely a soap opera set in space. Pickard is a pacifist wuss.I can't stress enough how UTTERLY BAD all ST spin-offs are.Btw, Killing Joke used a sample from this episode, the reciting of that number (875020079), on their ""Pandemonium"" album.",
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Mark of Gideon (TV Episode 1969)",A strange way to deal with over population,This episode sees Enterprise visiting the planet Gideon to negotiate its possible membership of the Federation. Everything they say makes their world like a paradise but they are isolationists and won't even allow their planet to be scanned. Their one concession is to allow Kirk to beam down. When he does something apparently goes wrong; he rematerialises in the transporter room of the Enterprise strangely the ship appears to be abandoned and Kirk is suffering from an injury he doesn't remember receiving. He searches and eventually meets one other person; a beautiful young woman who identifies herself as Odona. She claims to have no idea how she got on board; saying that she comes from a world that is so crowded that it is impossible to ever be alone. Alone together they start to grow close while strange things start to happen; we see crowds of people looking through the view-screen and it becomes apparent that the ship might not be moving. It turns out they are on Gideon and that far from being a paradise it is an incredibly overpopulated planet where people live longer and longer but a cultural objection to contraception means babies are born at the same rate as before they want Kirk for a more radical solution; to introduce a disease.It is fairly obvious that this is a facsimile of the Enterprise as we repeatedly cut back to the bridge of the real Enterprise where the crew are concerned about what happened to the captain. They have doubts about what the people of Gideon are saying but when they contact Star Fleet they are told it is a Federation matter and when they contact the Federation they are told it is a Star Fleet matter and neither will give permission for anybody to ignore the people of Gideon and beam down to investigate.This episode gets off to an interesting start but the fact that Kirk is on a replica ship rather than the crew mysteriously vanishing is resolved too quickly. Once we know this it seems pretty obvious that he is on Gideon. The way Odana describes her world makes it seem terrible but when we see glimpse of it it ceases to be believable it is so crowded that it is hard to believe such a world could feed itself. It is clearly meant to such that the creators of the series wanted to point out that once healthcare improvements mean most people will live long lives contraception becomes vital religion is never mentioned but this felt like an obvious comment on Catholic attitudes on the matter. There is also the matter of why they wasted so much of their precious space on building a replica of the Enterprise when they could have just grabbed Kirk when he beamed down. Things were better back on the real Enterprise; it was nice to see Spock's frustration at the refusal of Star Fleet and the Federation to authorise a mission to look for the captain. Overall a somewhat disappointing episode where the message was rather heavy handed.,6
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Mark of Gideon (TV Episode 1969)",Population Control,"In ""The Mark of Gideon"", the Enterprise heads for the planet of Gideon, a potential new entrant to the Federation of Planets. Its government has specifically asked for the Enterprise to come visit and for Captain Kirk to beam down for diplomatic relations reasons. Kirk heads down to the surface but something has gone wrong. He appears to be back on the Enterprise but now it is totally empty of personnel; he is alone. That is until a strange woman with no idea of her identity shows up to join him. The two try to figure out what has happened and why they have been brought here.Meanwhile Spock deals with bureaucracy as he attempts to locate the captain. The government of Gideon refuses to allow him to beam down to search for the missing captain; the Federation doesn't want Spock offending a potential new partner, forcing Spock to do nothing.It soon becomes apparent that Kirk and the mystery lady are aboard a replica of the Enterprise and have been brought there for some type of experiment. Gideon is dealing with a massive overpopulation issue and don't know how to solve it. They oppose the idea of contraception and now live virtually forever so the government has come up with an idea to thin the herd: a plague. Kirk has been selected because of his past with some deadly disease. He has introduced it to his lady companion, the daughter of Gideon's leader; she is now dying. The government plans to use Kirk's blood to introduce the disease en masse to the population.Finally, fed up with the diplomatic situation, Spock disobeys orders and beams down to where Kirk did. He wanders around the Enterprise before finding Kirk. Spock takes the captain and the sick woman back to the Enterprise. Bones cures her. She plans to head back to Gideon to use her blood to introduce the plague into the population. Everyone seems okay with this...What a weird episode and concept! The people of Gideon have a screw or two loose it seems. I can understand a culture not wanting to use contraception I suppose, but when overpopulation becomes as bad as it has, why not explore other options besides killing off your population? Gideon is about to become a member of the Federation so I'm assuming they have the ability for inter-planet space travel. Why not send some people abroad? There are plenty of other planets out there!I thought the beginning of this episode absolutely ruled. I just wish the rest of the episode lived up to it. Kirk wandering around the empty Enterprise in a state of befuddlement was awesome, the eerie sense of quiet and emptiness within its walls. I love Spock's use of diplomatic channels, his cool Vulcan head tossing out banter back and forth with the ambassador. I loved it!But then the people of Gideon begin to explain the plot of this one and it starts to make little sense very quickly. Odana and her dad are odd characters that I never really got a full grasp on. The people's character designs are lazy, especially the cattle walking around out back behind the scenes. It all felt very cheap and lazy. This episode had some real potential but sadly, it caves in under its own weight.",5
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Mark of Gideon (TV Episode 1969)",Another sub-par episode from season 3,"While there were some very good episodes during the last season of Star Trek, there were probably just as many disappointments--probably because they knew the series was on its last legs and no one in charge really seemed to care. While a score of 4 looks almost average, for Star Trek it is not and the episode was completely forgettable due to poor writing--and an abundance of plot holes.Kirk is beamed down to a planet to negotiate some sort of treaty or something but instead arrives in an exact duplicate Enterprise. He's all alone until later a lady appears and says she, too, has no idea how she got there. At the same time, the crew of the Enterprise is worried since they lost contact with Kirk and the officials on the planet say they have no idea where he is but also obviously hinder the investigation.I'll jump ahead and explain the why, as you shouldn't have to watch this episode--it's that dumb. It seems that the planet is actually so overwhelmingly overpopulated because they have no natural disease that they wanted to kidnap Kirk and take germs from him and introduce them to the woman--making her sort of like a ""Typhoid Mary"" who will help reduce the population through illness instead of instituting reasonable birth control. Huh?! This makes no sense on so many levels. First, why the ruse? They could have gotten germs from almost anywhere--why spend a fortune duplicating the Enterprise down to every minute detail and kidnap the Captain?! This might bring on SERIOUS repercussions from the Federation for kidnapping. Second, if the believe so strongly against birth control, maybe they should consider celibacy or pushing each other in front of buses! Third, if the planet is absolutely choked with people, why build the Enterprise--where will you put it? Fourth, why not start a war and kill of some people like we humans would have done?",4
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Mark of Gideon (TV Episode 1969)",People on Gideon apparently have no self control,"I won't attempt to summarize the plot as it is fairly complex and other reviews have summarized it just fine. My reaction to this episode: either the script writers don't understand population dynamics and human nature, or they do and just wanted to insult Catholics. The message of this episode seemed to be: without vigorous contraception and perhaps even abortion, sterilization, and euthanasia, we are all doomed to be literally buried in a giant mass of living bodies. There's three problems with this statement: 1) People can avoid having too many babies without resorting to contraception, abortion, sterilization, or infanticide. It's called self control. If humans don't copulate, they don't have babies. I know it's no fun to many people to have the self control to not get a girl pregnant, but it sure beats being buried alive in a mountain of living people. The people of Gideon would have learned self-control long before letting their planet get that bad.2) A planet only has finite resources. The food would run out and become a natural check to the population long before every square foot of the planet became covered with people. It's basic ecology. The creature at the top of its food chain, such as the tiger, has no natural predators, and yet it doesn't reproduce infinitely. The availability of food limits the population of top-level predators.3) The people of Gideon could have built up. The space above a planet's surface is limitless. For instance, take a walk through downtown New York during rush hour and you may feel like you are on Gideon. But once you step into a building and take the elevator up away from the planet's surface, there's plenty of space.",4
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Mark of Gideon (TV Episode 1969)",Spock Cuts Some Red Tape,"This episode of Star Trek prime should probably been done with a bigger budget, or when computer graphics came into use. You needed that to show the mass of humanity that was on the planet Gideon. Yet for a television show episode this one was effective and is a favorite of mine from the series.Captain Kirk beams down to the planet Gideon, but when he materializes it looks like he's beamed into an alternate universe because he's still on the Enterprise, but no one else is. His entire crew has vanished and he soon finds a waif of a young woman played by Sharon Acker. Acker tries real hard to get William Shatner's mojo going and she's doing her best and he's weakening. But more than a good time with Acker, he wants to find what's going on.The secret is a frightening one. Two things you should know, what can make a place a paradise can also turn it into a nightmare. Secondly this is an example of the concept of right to life run totally amuck.While Kirk is in his predicament, Spock is having a dual of words with the Gideon ruler played by David Hurst. Hurst won't let Leonard Nimoy come down and investigate. In the end Spock cuts some red tape, but even Vulcans can lose their patience and what he did was eminently logical.One of the best Trekkie episodes ever.",9
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Mark of Gideon (TV Episode 1969)",Star Trek: The Original Series - The Mark of Gideon,"Kirk agrees to beam down on Gideon when they offer only him the opportunity to do so, as the Federation has tried endlessly to diplomatically ally with the unknown planet. Gideon's commissioner (David Hurst) will not allow Spock to beam down to their planet's surface, to the coordinates Kirk does when he's ""missing"". Actually Kirk is on a replica of the Enterprise, soon meeting Odona (Sharon Acker) who is exhilarated to have space and be alone, without the cluttered bodies of overpopulation on her planet of Gideon. She acts as if she doesn't know where she came from, but I reckon few will accept Odona isn't from Gideon. The ""diplomatic sparring"" between Spock and Hurst is fun to watch, if just because Uhura, Scotty, and Bones convey how frustrated and annoyed they are from the refusal, no matter how polite and deceptively agreeable the Gideon counsel might seem when talking Kirk's whereabouts transporting to his position. The whole fake Enterprise chicanery seems a bit elaborate just to poison Odona with Kirk's blood. The ruse to trick Kirk is rather complicated...and the use of a virus to kill folks when Kirk's contraceptives would help to alleviate such t birthing problems is rather drastic and desperate. If anything, the knowledge that there's life elsewhere, space travel, and a chance to find space and alternatives on other planets, other galaxies, should be welcome by Gideon. Other solutions could be available if Gideon allows Starfleet to talk with them. Instead building a ship identical to the Enterprise (a bit far-fetched in itself) and letting Kirk romantically bond with yet another lovely humanoid woman before his blood sickens her seems over the top. I still love an empty Enterprise even if a replica with Kirk and Odona sharing it well. Spock visibly irked and trying to bury it under Vulcan logic is my personal favorite part of the episode. Not all that exciting was the plot to me, though. It is rather flawed in the message it posits...should forms of birth control, be it science or abortion, be offered when a planet is in need of such? Does a cultural belief system resistant to it devour itself? There's a compelling message there, but I think the writing doesn't quite tell an effective enough story.",5

Spock must try to find Kirk from the real Enterprise, while Kirk must find a way to get back to the real Enterprise.

There is a missed opportunity here. It would have been so much better if Kirk beamed down to the middle of an auditorium with a million Gideons. Then show some matte paintings of other areas of Gideon with billons of Gideons. The idea of a planet of beings who live very long lives, immune to most disease, and that revere life to prevent births and pro-life to outlaw abortion is fine. And the idea of having the Gideon leader's daughter sacrificing her life to introduce disease to the Gideon population is fine. But rather than having this done on a FAKE Enterprise, they could have done this on Gideon with the crowded people. As others have mentioned, food resources would have dwindled long ago causing famine and death. The acting was fine. Kirk, Spock, Hodin and Odona did well. McCoy and the rest have little to do. So this is not a great acting episode. The story idea is fine. The script sucks. The writers needed more time and help to build a solid script. It's still Star Trek and it should be viewed.",6

I always awe to see how writers choose to tell how death can be chosen over something. In this episode death was chosen over a long-life span, a disease-less life. They could easily solve the overpopulation problem by simply banning to populate by laws and apply prison or such sentences who broke it and do it strictly. It was first said that they couldn't sterilize people because every organs were restoring itself (this was also a hole against disease attempt but lets pretend this doesn't exist for the sake of topic) But then they couldn't even think of a solution by force of laws. Is really populating like animals and being vulnerable against diseases that important? Every being thinks of itself first, how creating life can be more important than your own? Of course you can care for someone more than yourself AFTER you have it. But giving up on your own life for something doesn't even exist yet is utterly rubbish. Thankfully actual scientists aren't like those surrealist emotional writers. The reason i raised my voice for this is because having a long life span is such a dream for us and is such an important thing to infinite possibilities of achievements therefore i can't stand when it's treated as if it was such an unimportant thing to give up.

The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless.

0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" That Which Survives (TV Episode 1969)","An adequate episode, dragged down by bad characterization","When the Enterprise investigates a strange planet, a mysterious woman abruptly appears to sabotage the ship and put it in danger of exploding, while simultaneously threatening to wipe out a stranded landing party led by Captain Kirk. Kirk and his crew must find out who or what this woman is, and why and how she is putting them all in such peril, before the ship is destroyed and the landing party killed off.This episode has a good, steady pace, solid plot, and a genuine sense of the Enterprise crew desperately trying to cope with a sudden, unknown threat before disaster overtakes them all. It manages to convey dramatically the idea that out in deep space our heroes will encounter unexpected and random threats any one of which might be more than they can handle. Also, I like that they take the time to give a little depth to the D'mato character (a likable guy who is enthusiastic about his work in geology) before killing him. And the regular characters treat his death with a little mourning and gravity. Too often on Star Trek the deaths of minor characters are glossed over by episode's end, like in installments where many men died horribly and then the script concludes with a lame joke. It ruins an episode's dramatic heft Here, we really care about D'mato's demise. Also, we get to see Scotty at his best, doing emergency repairs when danger looms, and taking risks because he does not want Spock to be the one to have to do it.This episode could have gotten a top ranking from me but it gets dragged down by serious mistakes in characterization. For one thing, Spock's personality in this episode is completely different than it is in the rest of the series. The usually composed, polite, patient Spock suddenly and inexplicably is turned into an arrogant, rude jerk who deserves to be demoted for his treatment of his shipmates during a time of peril. Ordinarily, Spock would only criticize someone's illogical thought patterns during laid back moments of reflection and spare-time conversation. Here, he is emotionally shooting people down right and left when he should be concentrating on solving the problem. It is completely inconsistent with everything we know about this character.To a lesser extent something similar is done with the Kirk character. Early on he is meaninglessly short and callous in his comments during the landing party. He returns to regular form quickly enough, but the damage is done. We now have two regular characters spewing dialogue inconsistent with what we know of their personalities and it serves to remind the viewer we're just watching actors reciting lines rather than actors being characters. It short circuits the drama. This one major error in the script manages to spoil the quality of the whole episode.This just goes to show you that what is really important in fiction is the characters, and if you get them wrong, you get the story wrong. The writers of this episode apparently thought the only way to create interesting dynamics between characters was to have them say pointlessly abrasive things people would not really say in real life. It is the mark of an amateur, so it is astonishing Gene Roddenberry himself and the great D.C. Fontana were two of the three writers who did this. They may be the admirable giants to Star Trek, but on this episode, they dropped the ball. But the plot's execution, at least, helps keep the episode floating enough to earn a seven out of ten.",7

I would definitely rank it as one of the better shows of the last season, though admittedly the bar is pretty low. If there's anything really odd about 'That Which Survives,' it's the dialogue. All of the characters are really snappish with each other. Sulu will say something and Kirk will almost bite his head off. Same thing goes on back at the Enterprise; Spock is more of a smartass than we've ever seen him before. Almost anything anyone says to him is met with a response dripping in sarcasm. It's quite a different approach and frankly it becomes annoying after a while, though some of his lines are funny. I don't recall any other episode of ST with dialogue quite like this. And it's all the more peculiar as the writer, John Meredyth Lucas, was a Trek veteran who wrote four shows including the fine episode 'The Changeling.' None of his other scripts display this odd approach to dialogue. Lee Meriwether is a good choice for the mysterious, lonely Losira and the scenes on the planet are the most interesting.",7

His own mother had to cut him off at the knees when he did that once). I've always thought that the ""folding Lee Meriwhether"" effect was cool but I'm not sure the episode really makes any sense.

There's really not much to the story. A mysterious woman keeps killing crew members and ends up being the projection of a computer (the swirling cubic disco ball of doom!) left on auto-pilot by an extinct civilization. The subplot of the Enterprise being thrown 1000 light years and suffering sabotage seemed added for no reason but to fill out the plot. The scenes where Scotty had to climb in by the plasma flow and make repairs or the ship would explode were entertaining thanks to fine acting by Doohan and nice visuals, but they make no sense from a scientific perspective and seem added for the sole purpose of creating drama. My wife walked in during the repair scenes and our conversation went something like this. My wife: ""Why is Scotty down by those sparks?"" Me: ""He has to fix a sci-fi-mumbo-jumbo-thingy."" My wife: ""Why doesn't he turn the sparks off first?"" Me: ""The enemy did some sci-fi-mumbo-jumbo-thingy to the ship so they can't."" My wife: ""Why did the enemy do that?"" Me: ""To create drama. There's no real reason given."" My Wife: ""How does he fix it?"" Me: ""He waves a sci-fi-mumbo-jumbo-thingy in a dangerous place."" My Wife: ""Why is it dangerous?"" Me: ""To create drama. There's no real reason given. My wife: ""Why don't they wait until the power runs out so the sparks go away so they can make repairs safely?"" Me: ""Because the ship is going to explode in 12 minutes."" My wife: ""Why is the ship going to explode?!"" Me: ""To create drama. There's no real reason given.""In summary, these scenes exemplify much of season three: contrived nonsense. Other odd tidbits:The woman is just an optical projection of a computer, but for some reason must physically touch people in order to kill them. - The woman's touch is only deadly to one predesignated person at a time and we never find out why. - The woman knows everyone's names and we're never told how. - The disco ball of doom has the power to explode every cell in a person's body from 1000 light years away, yet one phaser shot to and its destroyed (talk about anti-climatic). - The victims have every cell in their body exploded, and yet they look exactly the same on the outside. - Spock is unusually annoying in his demand for precision for no real reason.",4
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" That Which Survives (TV Episode 1969)",Losira: The Ultimate Symbol...,"I read a previous review (granted, from a few years back) that was titled ""Symbolism personified"" (written by ewaf58 from United Kingdom). In that review, there is mention of various symbols and what they represent. Interesting points are made. However, I write this review to point out the ultimate symbol: The very name Losira - The Siren. In Greek mythology, the Siren was a woman who enticed explorers - always men - to visit her as they passed by her remote island, so that she could lure them to their death. She was dangerous, yes, but also very beautiful - so beautiful that the men could not resist her call, regardless of the danger. Curiously, there was very little joy in the way the Siren went about this - actually, there was a sense of sadness within her - as if she bore no hatred toward these men, she was just doing what she always did, what she was created to do.We see much of this in Losira. The sadness and regret she would have felt in killing was apparent (and somehow transferred to her replicas), and integral to the plot. Incedentally, the casting of Lee Meriwether as Losira was a stoke of genius. While she brought the needed beauty to the role, she also brought the needed sadness. She rarely smiled - and when she did, it was a smile of sorrow and resignation (usually whilst saying ""I have come for you""), so as to reassure her victim not to worry, that in a moment he would be at true peace (and a truly restful one at that). You can clearly see how she struggles, when answering Kirk, to explain why her ""coming for"" Kirk's men is necessary. She takes no pleasure in it. Indeed, it is as if she has no control over it. So in that way, she is all powerful (killing someone instantly, transporting the Enterprise nearly 1000 light years away in a flash, etc) and yet quite vulnerable. The producers could have chosen from among a host beauties of the 1960's - Jill St. John, Shelley Fabares, Mary Ann Mobley (like Meriwether, a former Miss America), but they went with Meriwether - who was beautiful, strong, intelligent, elegant (in manner) and, above all, determined. That Meriwether was able to include an element of sadness to this role is what makes her performance truly memorable. Also, unlike the previously mentioned actresses, she was not a girl, she was a woman - ALL woman (Meriwether was 34 years old, with 15 years experience in front of a camera, at the time of filming), which brings a level in mature understanding to the character that a younger actress may not have been able to provide. It is easy to see how Kirk could be (in order) intrigued by her, afraid of her, sympathetic toward her, and ultimately, admiring of her. Indeed, when he is explaining to Mr. Spock that she was the last survivor of the Kalandan race, he said ""she must have been a remarkable woman"", with a sense of regret and sadness that was much like the way Losira (via her replica) spoke to him. I still can remember the wistful look on his face when he said this - William Shatner really is a fine actor.As for the rudeness of some of the characters toward each other, there is some truth in this. However, I will point out that the following exchange, between Spock and Scotty is one of the funniest I ever heard in the entire series...Spock: ""Can you give me warp eight?""Scotty: ""Aye, sir. And maybe a wee bit more. I'll sit on the warp engines myself and nurse them.""Spock: ""... That position, ... Mister Scott ... would not only be unavailing but also ... undignified.""",8
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" That Which Survives (TV Episode 1969)","""This thing is going to blow up...""","Boy, didn't you just want to smack Spock upside the head for his characterization here? He was never more annoying, and even though he's my favorite Star Trek character, I was going 'enough already' with his determination to put down all of his fellow crew members with precision and logic. Come on Spock - couldn't you round 990.7 light years up to a thousand? I think everybody would have been on the same page with you.On top of that, once Losira turns out to be a hologram, the whole story falls apart. How was her 'touch' so deadly if she wasn't real? I suppose the last of the planet's scientists could have concocted some relationship between the image and the cellular disruption gimmick, but that was never offered.Another thing - I don't think the Enterprise was ever challenged before with the warp factor established here. If I recall correctly, the ship never, ever reached Warp 10 in any prior episode, but here it accelerated to 11.2, then 11.9, 13.2 and holy asteroids (sorry, thought this was a 'Batman' episode), topping out at 14.1! I think it was established in an earlier show that 10.0 would make the ship a goner, but I could be making that up. Just like they made this one up on the fly.The one redeeming feature of the show, and I was reminded when I saw her, but I had totally forgotten how gorgeous Lee Meriwether was. I'm sure the Captain would have willingly traded her character for another episode where he got to get up close and personal. Oh well, you can't win them all.",6
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" That Which Survives (TV Episode 1969)",problematic season 3 episode,"'That Which Survives' is another example of a subpar episodes of season 3 of Star Trek. The premise of the show is not credible: Losira the last surviving defender of the Kalandan colony on the young planet Kirk and his crew men are visiting is so powerful that she can hurl the Enterprise 990 light years away, kill the crewman who was beaming down Kirk's party and home in and cause Kirk's phaser to overload and explode. And yet, once on the planet, Losira doesn't quickly dispose of Kirk and his surviving crew--D'Amato, Sulu and McCoy--on the Kalandan planet with several laser blasts or trap them in a force field and instead has to resort to creating numerous holograms of Losira's image to physically touch--and thus kill--them. The premise is preposterous. Losira is so technologically advanced and yet so weak at the same time? Then the damaged Enterprise warps back to the Kalandan colony despite the fact that the ship's engines are 'out of sync' due to an explosive problem in the matter anti-matter flow of the Enterprise's warp engines as Scotty informs Spock. Spock and a landing party conveniently save Kirk, Sulu and McCoy just in time from being killed by the various holograms of Losira. Frankly, there is one too many coincidences in this one episode which just proves William Shatner's comments in his book 'Star Trek Memories' that as season 3 of TOS progressed, its scripts actually ""regressed, becoming less believable and perceptibly more far-fetched."" (p.266) Finally, there was simply no real drama or point to this show. Losira--or the computer which projects her--is far too passive as the last defender of her long extinct colony to be taken seriously. However, there were some hilarious scenes in the Spock-Scotty and Spock-Uhura interactions which slightly elevated this show. Usually, we never get a Scotty-Spock relationship but in this case, it works--but only barely. We also got to see Sulu in action on the Kalandan colony itself--rather than remaining the Enterprise's helmsman. Perhaps if the episode had better pacing and film execution, 'That Which Survives' would not be an underrated show. As such, I'll raise my rating to 6/10; inferior but just passable for a season 3 episode. Since it was penned by DC Fontana herself (under a psudonym), the script was quite logical but Spock was very irritating in his treatment of Uhura and Scotty. When Scotty saves the Enterprise from exploding from a matter-antimatter flux in the engine core, he says to Spock--""won't you at least thank me?"" To which Spock makes the belittling reply: ""why do you humans feel the need to be so emotional. Scotty just did the logical thing!"" You could almost fall asleep at this point. Its clear that Scotty would have had just as cold a relationship working with Spock as McCoy did with Spock.",6
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" That Which Survives (TV Episode 1969)","The stars are ""all wrong"" this time around.","For Trekkies one of the worst episodes, but for me this is the campiest of them all; not as much regarding what happens but what is being said. There are Edwoodesque dialogues here that had me in stitches.Listed below are some lines/dialogues from TWS. See if you can figure out where the actual dialogue ends and where invented parts begin... (perhaps not that easy!).1. Sulu: ""The Enterprise must have blown up, Captain!"" Kirk: ""Yeah, well, who cares...?"" 2. Helsmwoman: ""Mr. Spock, the planet's gone!"" 3. Sulu: ""Captain, the ship simply disappeared! What does that mean??"" Kirk: ""Well, it means we're stranded here."" Sulu: ""But, Captain, aren't you worried about the lives of 400 of your crew??"" Kirk: ""I already told you: I ain't. This is Season 3, and I'm a little more apathetic about things."" 4. Helmswoman: ""What bothers me is the stars, Mr.Spock... they're all wrong."" Spock: ""There's something wrong with your head, Missy. The stars are fine just as they are..."" 5. McCoy: ""I wonder what killed him..."" Kirk: ""I don't know... But something or someone did."" This is almost the same sort of exchange as in ""Plan 9"": ""I don't know... But one thing's for sure: there's a dead body here, and someone's responsible!"" 6. Scotty: ""Mr. Spock, the ship feels wrong."" Spock: ""What do you mean 'feels wrong'?"" Scotty: ""The field is all wrong."" Spock: ""Oh, the FIELD is all wrong. I thought you said 'it feels wrong'."" Scotty: ""I DID say that!"" 7. Losira: ""I am... from this planet."" Sulu: ""So the planet IS hollow!"" Losira: ""No, Sulu, the script-writer's head is hollow."" 8. Losira: ""I have come for you, Mr.Sulu... I want to touch you."" Sulu: ""Touch Kirk! I'm gay..."" 9. Sulu: ""How can such evil BE, Captain?! She's so beautiful..."" Kirk: ""I know... Evil only comes from ugly people."" 10. Sulu: ""I'd rather be on the Enterprise."" (Translation: ""Mommy, I wanna go home!!"") Kirk: ""I agree, Sulu... I'd rather rest my head between Uhura's massive pillows now than be fighting aliens on this damn planet."" One of the most amazing, absurd, unique hence entertaining aspects of this wildly funny episode is Spock's atypical grumpiness, which manifests itself at least a dozen times in sarcasm(!) and put-downs(!!) of crew members. The cranky side of Spock, that we didn't even know existed until TWS, really comes into the forefront in this episode. Perhaps male Vulcans have their period every seven years?No-one was safe from Spock's venomous ripostes. Examples:1. When Uhura asks ""what happened?"", after the ship is shaken up, Spock proceeds to literally and in full detail explain the physics of his fall - like some demented robot, and without a trace of sarcasm. (He was still warming up for the upcoming sarcastic remarks.) 2. Uhura: ""How did she get off the ship, sir?"" Spock: ""Presumably the same way she got on it."" This was such a cheap shot by Spock, the kind of dumb comment one could expect from a 6th-grader! 3. Sick-bay Doctor: ""Your guess is as good as mine, Mr.Spock."" Spock: ""I would suggest you refrain from guessing and focus on the task at hand."" So the TWS Spock can dish out sarcasm, but is too dim too detect it from others, or at least to recognize a common phrase when he hears one.4. Uhura: ""What are the chances the Captain and the others are still alive?"" Spock: ""Lieutenant, we do not engage in gambling."" This, coming from Starfleet's Annual Intergalactic Useless Statistics/Odds Champion! Meriwether, looking vaguely Raquel Welchian, going around killing people in spite of feeling ambivalent about hurting them is a bit amusing, too. (The wishy-washiest killer of them all.) At the end, Kirk and co. even engage in quasi-slapstick, when they keep changing the order of how they stand to avoid being touched by the strange pacifistic-yet-murdering alien woman/robot.Apart from bombarding the viewer with unintentional nonsense every single minute, TWS is also a visually high-quality episode, with great sets and wonderfully bombastic 60s colours. The Losira-gets-folded special effect is very effective.",
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" That Which Survives (TV Episode 1969)",That Which is Not Very Thrilling,"This is a typically sub-average episode of the 3rd season and since the 3rd season was not very good compared to the 1st and 2nd seasons, well, you can see where this is going. There appears to be some mystery, action, tension and sf adventure thrown into the mix here but none of it adds up to much by the end. The Enterprise arrives at a planet which even Spock can't explain: it's about the size of our moon but has Earth's characteristics. There's mention, also, that it's only several thousand years old and anyone with minimal knowledge of astronomical/geological time measures knows this is not possible for a natural planet. Kirk beams down with McCoy, Sulu and a geologist (uh-oh, expendable red-shirt alert) and the ship is immediately transported nearly 1000 light years away. Huh? This amazing act of displacement is never really explained. Several 3rd season episodes had such nonsensical contrivances to the plot: this seems an excuse to have a separate storyline on the ship while the landing party struggles to survive on the planet. But, they're zero for two in this one: neither the 'A' or 'B' storyline is up to snuff - slow going in both.On both the planet and the ship, the crew are stalked and killed by what seems to be a female hologram (Meriwether); they don't refer to it as a hologram, but that's what it seems like to me - an early version of the holodeck from the TNG show. This female disrupts all the cells of a body simply by touching that person; she announces beforehand who she's for, i.e. ""I am for you, James Kirk"" (the meaning is not what Kirk hopes for). Spock is never more annoying than in this episode; in command of the ship for most of the episode, he takes every opportunity to lecture the other crew members on how illogical they are. This does turn out to be an intriguing comparison to how the ship is usually run (by Kirk). Check out Uhura's annoyed expression when he lectures her about gambling. Dr. M'Benga is back (see ""A Private Little War"") - I guess he's Doc#2 on the ship. ""My guess would be valueless"" Spock tells him, almost in anger. And, of course, Spock's verbal attacks on Scotty are never ending; I'm surprised there were no whispers of mutiny by the time they got back to the planet. This repartee is all mildly entertaining but the story is tedious overall, with no interesting revelations about the ancient outpost of a planet or the attacking femme fatale.",5

And then the Enterprise is hurled almost a 1000 light years away.The beautiful woman is former Miss America Lee Meriwether and she's deadly to the touch as she kills both another Enterprise crew member on board and the geologist on the away team. Remarkable she turns up in two places light years away and causes considerable damage.But there is a logical explanation for all this and more than Spock endeavor to find it.

11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" That Which Survives (TV Episode 1969)",Spock gets sarcastic and Kirk is afraid of being touched by a beautiful woman,"This episode sees the crew of the Enterprise investigating a mysterious planet; it is only the size of the Moon and is a mere five thousand years old but it appears to sustain life, have an atmosphere and be the mass of the Earth. Just as Kirk, McCoy, Sulu and an expendable geologist beam down to the surface a beautiful woman appears in the transporter room saying they must not got to the planet; she then kills the transporter operator with a single touch! Soon after the away team arrive the planet suffers a major earthquake; when it is over there is no sign of the Enterprise. As they search for anything that might be edible the same beautiful woman appears and approaches the geologist, she says she has come for him before touching and killing him. It isn't that long before she is coming for the others although it becomes apparent that she can only harm the specific person she has come for. Back on the Enterprise the crew discover that the entire ship has been moved to a point almost a thousand light years away and the same woman kills an engineer as he examines the engines after Scotty states that something doesn't feel right. Further investigations reveal sabotage that could destroy the ship as it hurtles back to the planet.This might not be a great episode but it isn't terrible either. It was nice to see that geologist Lt. D'Amato was given a bit of character rather than being the typical doomed character whose sole purpose is to die in a mysterious way. The fact that the danger came from a beautiful woman was a bit of a cliché; it seems that almost every episode must feature a beautiful guest star dressed in a fairly revealing costume. The way she only came for a specific crewmember each time was intriguing though leaving the viewer wondering if there is one woman, several identical women or she is something else. Spock seems strangely out of character here; he has always been logical but now, as he takes command of the ship, he seems merely obtuse and sarcastic as he is overly precise and criticises any wording that is inexact or even employs metaphor. The story is tense though; I especially liked the scene where Scotty struggles to fix the ship knowing that the slightest mistake could destroy the ship; James Doohan was really good in this scene. Overall a fairly mixed episode with some great moments but also some that are almost laughable and not in an intended way.",7

I'm glad he's normally not turned up to 11 like this.Regarding the rest of the episode, it's not laughably bad or anything. It's just lazy. They don't try anything exciting, there's nothing fun going on here. The writers, the actors, the director, everyone is just phoning it in here.

In the same way that the ""Trouble With Tribbles"" episode was written to basically just be a lot of one-liners and slapstick, this episode seems to attempt to completely re-write the basic personality of Mr. Spock -- he is, in this episode, simply a sarcastic bastard -- why would the writer do this?In every Star Trek except this one, Mr. Spock has a consistent personality and outlook, and ways of dealing with the emotional humans he works with on the Enterprise. In this episode, despite the emergency situation which is non-stop, Spock takes time out to make sarcastic comments to everyone -- not only is he sarcastic, but it seems the writer was deliberately trying to make some of Spock's comments funny (totally out of character), as he constantly misinterprets statements made by others, as if he had no experience at all with the ways humans talk.In the ""Court Martial"" episode, Spock told us that ""human beings have characteristics, just as inanimate objects do.""

Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. The series didn't seem to mature as it should have but definitely has improved on terms of implementing smarter approach, parallel plot lines and thought provoking concept.Season 03Contrary to expectations, second season failed to project the essential character development which would have give a perfect arc to the series and instead focused on different cases. In this final season the expectations are still higher as they have somehow glued their audience with their gripping screenplay and innovative imagination that doesn't flinch on pushing the boundaries.That Which SurvivesThe conflicts are similar and so are the solutions and the tense environment created in here fails to communicate with the audience; its a swing and a miss, addition to that, such episodes aren't feasible by the series especially in the end.",
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Lights of Zetar (TV Episode 1969)","""The loss of the galaxy may be irretrievable...""","There was a great concept at the core of this story, but unfortunately, it got frittered away with a script that eventually proved embarrassing. The concept had to do with Lieutenant Romaine's (Jan Shutan) brain wave pattern being altered by an alien presence, a cluster of ten life forms in a single entity that arrives aboard The Enterprise as a cloud of twinkling lights. They really could have gone somewhere with this, but instead, went to a place no man had gone before.Let me back up a bit though. Are we to believe that the Federation was naive enough to establish Memory Alpha, a cultural and scientific repository of all the member planets, on a planetoid WITHOUT a protective shield? What??!! With the example of Kirk's crew facing some kind of danger in almost every episode, wouldn't anyone have been concerned that maybe, just maybe, a Federation enemy might want to sabotage all that knowledge. Klingons... Romulans... anyone? At least the Captain showed some astonishment over the idea.But then Kirk did the unimaginable - he fired phasers into the brain community because they weren't responding to Uhura's hailing frequency. Did you see the look on Spock's face when Kirk ordered the phaser fire? Man, I thought the Captain was setting himself up for a Vulcan nerve pinch.The resolution of the story was uninspired as well. How do you pressurize a non-corporeal entity into submission? I'm trying to get a grasp on that; it would be like trying to squeeze a radio wave until the receiver couldn't produce a sound any more.But you know what really got my attention? I don't know if anyone else noticed, but considering the fact that Lieutenant Romaine was on her first assignment as a specialist, and maybe even the fact that Scotty had an enormous crush on her, how is it that Kirk and Bones found it OK to call her 'girl'? It happened more than once and had a jarring effect whenever I heard it. I hope the Captain wasn't jealous.",6
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Lights of Zetar (TV Episode 1969)",My Ship is Being Pursued by Lights in Space!,"Here it is: the most forgettable Trek episode of the entire 3-year run of the original series. I've seen it a few times over the past 30 years and the only image I could remember until now were these lights flashing in the eye of the female lieutenant, newly-assigned to the Enterprise and the object of Scotty's desires. There are a couple of mildly-amusing scenes of Scotty mooning or swooning over this Lt. Romaine but, otherwise, there's nothing else to elicit even a modicum of interest. Other really low-rated episodes of the 3rd season, such as ""Spock's Brain"" and ""The Way to Eden,"" at least have that campy ridiculous tone to fall back on or the cheese factor which can be appreciated in our weaker moments. Other boring 3rd season episodes still have some moderately interesting ideas straining to grab our attention, however weakly. Not in this one. This one is just consistently dull throughout - interminably dull, genuinely sleep-inducing - the 'watching grass grow'-type of dull.The plot has the Enterprise heading towards Memory Alpha, a planetoid functioning as a central library for the entire Federation. This is really the only idea presented here - a galactic library of the future. This concept is soon wrapped up unceremoniously when the library is wiped out by these Lights of Zetar. The Zetar Lights leave, then they return (these are literally flashing points of light). They chase down the Enterprise. They infect Lt. Romaine somehow. She opens her mouth and strange noises come out, like she's about to vomit. The Zetar Lights leave again, then they follow the ship some more. Kirk does decide to fire phasers soon and, you may think, OK, the action is kicking in finally, but he has to stop when Scotty starts crying on the intercom. The top officers sit down with Romaine in the conference room and have a long discussion. The end of this scene, when Kirk explains their final strategy, does contain Shatner's worst acting moment of the series (""If.. we ...can...CONTROL! ..that moment!"" accompanied by an odd hand gesture). Oh, yes, there is one nearly-exciting moment when Sulu informs Kirk that...the lights are changing their velocity! Monotony - thy name is Zetar.",3

This cloud takes a special interest in a new female crew member that Scotty is smitten over. The cloud tries to take control of the girl's body through her brain. In the end, the light cloud ends up being the spirits of dead humans looking for a body to possess. Not much of this episode makes a whole lot of sense or is very compelling. Why did the spirits seek out this one girl? Why did the spirits of decent humans think they had the right to possess another human? Why did the spirits make the bodies they possess talk like frogs? How can a air pressure chamber possibly drive out spirits and brain waves from the girl? The only reasonable answer to these questions seems to be: ""do whatever it takes to move the story along"". Scotty asks rather sweetly to his love interest, which is refreshing compared to Kirk's usual domineering womanizing. But his sweetness gets rather pathetic and condescending, like he is trying to pet a little a sparrow.",5

Although their purpose is somewhat vague, their arrival via a ""psychic storm cloud"" heralds a bizarre takeover and some interesting side-effects. When the ship approaches Memory Alpha, Mira Romaine starts having visions of impending danger, and the landing party go down to investigate....Once on Alpha's surface, the backlash of the Zetar arrival is seen. One female technician starts to talk in a slow frog-like garble, then she undergoes a weird horrifying convulsive transformation...and then dies.Mira is beamed down, but is unable to make head or tail out of what Kirk and the others had witnessed - until she senses that the Zetarians are coming back (apparently sensing their job had not finished 'coz more survivors of their attack have been pinpointed).Kirk realises the only way to rid Mira of her condition is to subject her to decompression. Scotty, who had taken a serious ""fancy"" to the ""lassie"" (apparently having gotten over Lt. Carolyn Palamas ""Who Mourns For Adonais"" in a big hurry) strongly and uncategorically objects - until he is forced to give in to Kirk's orders.Mira decompresses, the aliens flee their ""host"" and the episode concludes with Romaine deciding to stay behind on Memory Alpha to help ""clean up"" the mess left by the cloud-beings.Scotty is again left, with a broken heart...poor dude. This was obviously the last hurrah romantically for the engineer since no other lassie has captured his attention away from his ""bairns"" since...The viewer has to wonder what the Zetars were, what their intentions were - whether good or for evil - is now left for a new Star Trek series to take on, along with any other dangling plot-thread the original series leaves hanging...8 out of 10 - only for the afore-mentioned groovy Courage ""alien takeover"" sequences",8
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Lights of Zetar (TV Episode 1969)",Pretty dull stuff,"I read a book a few years ago by some insiders from the Star Trek show. It was fascinating to hear what they had to say about Roddenberry, Shatner and the whole experience. One of the things about the book that stood out in my mind was their opinion about the 3rd season. Although the show had almost been canceled early on and Gene Roddenberry instigated a letter-writing campaign to save the show, by the final season, they felt that Roddenberry had given up on the show and actually spend much of this season on other projects. This, they said, accounted for the often sub-par scripts used in them. And, looking back at it, season three had plenty of duds and plenty more only watchable episodes that were pretty easy to forget. This episode is one of the forgettable ones, as not a whole lot of energy is in it. There's a weird space killer that makes people talk in a goofy froggy voice and Scotty seems strangely attracted to a froggy-voiced lady that somehow has survived one of these attacks. That's it--the rest of it just isn't worth discussing, as it just seemed to go nowhere.",4
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Lights of Zetar (TV Episode 1969)","Mr Kyle Has Another Transporter ""Issue"", Other than That....? It Sucks.","I hate to be harsh on my favorite show of all time, but I am a realist and there were some bad episodes, especially in the later half of season three, as this is an example. OK here are the observations as the plot is discussed by others. Mr Kyle (the bumbling English dude who can do little right except for one episode I saw when he was at the helm and was noted for a citation), has another of his ""transporter moments"". His most famous one was in ""Mirror Mirror"" the one where there's an alternate Spock with a goatee, and he is subjected to the ""agonizer"" by Spock, remember that scene? Well in that alternate universe I predict Kyle is killed for too many transporter ""issues"", here he is just told to get the hell out of the way so that Scottie can make the damn thing work. The Enterprise is the main set here, again, obviously for the budget's sake. I remember this episode from my youth mainly because of the scene where they discover the dieing technician and because of the totally laughable faces she is making and the weird slow tape noise she is making (that had to be what that was that they used). In finality why does this episode suck so much, its really boring and pointless. Also, Scottie is not going to have a crush on a chick to ignore the ship the way he did, he had love interest's before so that is not going to work. No memorable scenes between McCoy, Spock, Kurt, or Scottie, or any of the other crew (Kyle's repeated transporter malfunctions a slight exception). It just sucks. 3 of 10, places in the bottom 10 maybe bottom 5 or 3 of the worse Trek TOS ever made.",3
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Lights of Zetar (TV Episode 1969)",For the love of Scotty,"As this episode opens we learn that Scotty has fallen for Lt. Mira Romaine; a young officer being transferred to Memory Alpha, a remote base that will house a database containing all the Federation's knowledge. Before they arrive the Enterprise observes a phenomenon travelling at over twice the speed of light; Spock deduces it can't be natural. This phenomenon intercepts the ship and effects each of the people aboard; most noticeably Lt. Romaine. She collapses and we see a pattern in her eyes that looks just like the phenomenon. She claims to be perfectly well despite being ordered to sickbay. The phenomenon then strikes Memory Alpha; this time the effects are more serious and all but one person in the station is killed and the computer destroyed. The sole survivor talks in a strange way; much like Mira did after the attack on the Enterprise. Further tests are carried out on Mira and it becomes apparent that her brain waves have been changed to those of the phenomenon. It later speaks through her; explaining that they are the last survivors of Zetar and they are looking for a host body. Kirk is unwilling to let them have Lt. Romaine's body so asks McCoy to find a way to force them out the only way possible but her at risk but it is a risk that must be taken.This is a decent enough episode and it was nice to see Scotty have some romance in his life although I'm sure every viewer would have known something would happen to her during the course of the episode! The aliens were interesting enough but hardly the most original and there was little sense that anybody on the Enterprise other than Lt. Romaine was in much danger. The effects were decent enough, at least in the remastered version I saw. Guest star Jan Shutan does a pretty solid job as Lt. Romaine; it isn't hard to see why Scotty fell for her! The episode does show its age somewhat as Kirk and the McCoy constantly refer to Lt. Romaine, a Star Fleet officer, as 'The Girl' perhaps acceptable when the show was made but rather un-PC now! Overall though this isn't a bad episode; it certainly entertained me well enough.",7
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Lights of Zetar (TV Episode 1969)",Interesting but not sterling.,"One of the things I really like about this episode is the lighting. There's a certain visual aesthetic that we see in both science fiction and regular film and TV as we transition from film stock that needs a lot of light to something that's a bit more natural and even.I bring this up not because the episode is one of the less memorable episodes, but because we're seeing the crew of the starship Enterprise mature some and leave the visual doldrums of a kind of bright color late 1950s 1960's kind of visual, to something that's more realistic and business like. The result is that this episode's story and lack of money is punched up a notch.Season three episodes are infamous for being low budget because the network wanted to pull the plug earlier. But even so the third Season of Star Trek has a kind of tacit appeal in that the episodes are more character driven than plot driven as per the previous seasons.The basic tale is a bit of a ghost story, but even so Kirk and Spock bring starfleet's capabilities to bear to address the collective malefactor in this episode. And here's where the show comes close to derailing, because the other stories deal with negative elements in society, things we can relate to, and here we're confronted with something that comes close to being supernatural. And the bad guys are never explained, so the script fails in that regard as both a Star Trek and general science fiction story.Another strike against the show is that the female guest star has a first and last name, but Captain Kirk and even McCoy and Spock occasionally refer to her as ""the girl"". Oh well.In short it's not good science fiction, but it could have been better, and even though the actors give it their all the core premise of the episode falls a bit flat. Again, not a bad episode, but nothing to write home about. If you're a fan of the show, then you've already made up your mind. Otherwise maybe see it once if you haven't, but there are better episodes in the series.Take that for what it's worth.",

The Enterprise heads to the planetoid of Memory Alpha, where computers hold cultural, historic and scientific information - they are going there to install new equipment. Mr. Scott and Lieutenant Mira Romaine have been working on the project together and forming a romance. When they get close to the planetoid, they encounter a strange energy storm, moving quickly, that has killed the staff at Memory Alpha. That energy storm has also possessed Lt. Romaine when the ship passed into it yet the rest of the crew had strange parallelizations: from not able to move their hands, to not being able to speak. Spock has clearly stated that it's moving to fast to be a natural phenomenon and it's not a storm. Romaine ends up in sickbay because she passed out, McCoy wants to know why only her, Scotty believes it's because it's her first time for space travel and she just wants to know why it happened. They arrive to Memory Alpha to find all dead but one who was barely alive and trying to say something. McCoy's readings say they died because each of them have a different area of the brain missing. Romaine beams down and warns the search party that the storm is on it's way back and will kill them all - she just knows. Kirk confronts Romaine if she could remember what she said when she was knocked out on the ship. They beam back aboard to find out what is this storm exactly while trying to steer clear of it. Scotty still insists to Romaine it's just space sickness and she still thinks it's more. Now they must find out not what it is but what ""they"" are.Not too bad of an episode - it is interesting and a pretty good mystery that Kirk and crew must solve.7.5/10",7

10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Lights of Zetar (TV Episode 1969)",Too much sci-fi for Trekkies.,"""Scotty In Heat"".TLOZ is one of the best episodes of the 3rd season. It seems most Trekkies (a very goofy species) were appalled by the lack of ""meaningful, social/political commentary"", i.e. there is no analogy with the Vietnam war, hippies, freedom of speech, and any other modern-day (or at least 60s) issues - which, from what I can tell, is what is needed to appease those nerdy liberals (hence the large popularity of the ultra-PC, plastic ST spin-offs, all of which suck big time). TLOZ has a straight-forward sci-fi story, and that's the way it should have always been. In other words, no American Constitution parallels as in the supremely silly (but somewhat fun so-bad-it's-good) ""Omega Glory"" episode. I prefer ST when it's immersed in the sci-fi genre, where it belongs (""The Alternative Factor"", ""The Menagerie"", ""Wink Of An Eye""), while the political/social-analogy, issue-of-the-day-brought-to-outer-space episodes very often failed, coming off as too preachy and naive (""Assignment: Earth"", ""The Day Of The Dove"", or the supremely awful/embarrassing ""The Way To Eden"").The only silly aspect of TLOZ is Scotty's exaggeratedly obsessive attachment to Mira, played by Jan Shutan, one of the most beautiful actresses in the series. Scotty is so blinded by ""lurve"" that he even fails to report Mira's strange observations, nor does he even encourage her to report them! That way he not only forgets about his true love, the Enterprise, but actually endangers Mira's life, as well. In short: Scotty acts like a full-blown in-puberty adolescent moron throughout the episode. The fact that Shutan would probably rather vomit on Doohan than have a relationship with him doesn't help the realism between them either...I thought it was hilarious that many consider the eye- and sound-effects bad or cheesy. They were quite effective, showing how much can be achieved with a shoe-string budget, with a little imagination. Those who criticize TLOZ's special effects are the same uncritical dolts who probably shake in their boots whenever they watch the Mugatu jump on Kirk in ""A Private Little War""! Besides, TLOZ has no annoying switcheroos (""Turnabout Intruder""), no dull, one-dimensional Klingons, and no annoying kids (""Miri"").",

Season 3 has a number of love stories, and while TLOZ may not qualify as Star Trek at it's best, by no means is it Star Trek at its worst. If one can look past flaws in the technical writing of the script, one finds a May-December romance in its most beautiful form between Lt. Cmdr. Montgomery Scott and Lt. Mira Romaine. Scotty is a much-beloved character, and it is both satisfying and fitting that in the series last season he should finally have a love story of his own and with a woman worthy of his heart.

Mira Romaine (Jan Shutan), on her first tour with the Enterprise. If Mira allows them to take full control she will be lost to them. Mira wants to live and doesn't wish to have her body used by other lifeforms who simply don't want to die. So Kirk, who has proof when the Zetar lifeforms killed scientists at a library on a planet while they were studying (the library has no protective shields; those who built it felt there was no need of shields for a library made for everyone's welcomed use), is rightfully concerned for his Enterprise crew and attempts to back the cloud off with phasers, unknowingly harming Mira in the process. So this is his dilemma: how does he save Mira and stop the Zetar lifeforms from killing his officers? ""The Lights of Zetar"" will probably be best remembered for giving Scotty a romantic love interest; and, man, does he gush adoringly at her throughout, even forgetting his Engineering duties, much to Kirk's annoyance. Well, the menace of this episode isn't exactly the most sinister looking threat to appear on a Star Trek episode, a cloud of multi-colored lights, but the test before Kirk and company does have its moments, particularly when they beam down to a library station finding innocent alien scientists dead, their corpses lying in heaps. The weird garbled noise and the highly open mouths of those inflicted with the Zetar lifeforms are just bizarre moments during this Trek episode. One victim's face actually ""lights up"" before perishing to add another touch of surreal to how the Zetarians try to infiltrate and control human(oid) hosts. It seems that the brains of those possessed become so damaged by the Zetarians attempts to take complete control that the results for the most part end in death, chiefly because those inflicted aren't willing to give up their bodies to other invading forces. The episode is okay, I guess, not really what I would consider particularly noteworthy, but it does have a final scene that finds Bones and Spock actually agreeing on something, so that in itself is surprising/amusing. Most importantly, this caters to Scotty so that might be enough to recommend to Star Trek fansseeing him lovelorn and head-over-heels can be a bit much, though. Even though this will be considered by many as below average for the series, even mediocre Star Trek TOS to me can be somewhat enjoyable. Another odd touch I failed to mention was how the episode shows Romaine's possession, the cloud appears in the iris of her left eye as she goes into a trance. I imagine The Lights of Zetar will, for the most part, be considered another example of how uninspired and average the third season started to become as the series came to a close, Roddenberry's absence noticeable.",5

The crew encounters a strange phenomenon not possible in nature, a sparkling of lights that seems to attack the crew and stop it from doing things such as speak or move their limbs. The lights drift away towards Memory Alpha where it kills all the lifeforms on it. It heads back towards the Enterprise in pursuit. A new crew member with a romantic interest in Scotty, Mira Romaine, seems to be unusually affected by these lights. As it turns out, these lights are the remnants of an extinct lifeform. They want to use Mira as a vessel to live out their lives. She must do her best to resist them and retain her own body.This episode was extremely muddled. I liked that a character besides Kirk had a romantic subplot but it really never goes anywhere. The effects of the creatures are sub-par, the acting seems stiff, the actors uninterested. Lots of these later Season 3 episodes are not my favorite of the series. They make me yearn for the production value and ingenuity of Season 1 & 2 episodes.

Here Scotty is taken with Mira, who is on her first mission. I don't know where new crew members come from. So many redshirts and other throwaways seem to meet their demises. Anyway, the ship is like a small town and it would seem everyone would know everyone else. All that aside, Mira has Scotty's attention and it seems to be mutual.

Mira, unfortunately, absorbs this creature. Her personality changes and she begins to have visions. The Starship crew is faced with the task of getting this thing out of her as well as freeing the Enterprise from its influence.

She is no great actress and has that ""Stepford wife"" vibe. Scotty is acting like a teenager, even shirking his work. The Captain is a little annoyed, but cuts Scotty some slack, due to his many lonely years. It seems ludicrous though, that the Captain would be putting information about the crew's love life into the official Ship Log.The next thing you know, an alien life force and/or computer takes over the beautiful lieutenant's mind and tries to destroy the ship! The Doctor and Mr Spock attempt to help undo the damage by studying the intricacies of her psychological profile,focusing on ""telepathy"" and ""ESP"" which was all the rage in 1968.Would true love save the day? Would the Lt's love for Scotty help her break free of the alien? I am pretty sure Leonard Nimoy was rolling his eyes at some of the dialogue.If you like camp and a plot full of silly holes, this is an episode for you. Naturally we never again hear of the romance between lieutenant and Scotty.The statements made by McCoy about the Lt's psychological profile were ridiculously dated in 1968, not to mention 2268. Also, the notion of needing an entire planet devoted to a library is anachronistic. Paper books were antiques in the 23rd century , as we know from other episodes.

It might be that by this point they sensed the series would be toast in a couple months and played this stuff for laughs. Nimoy is obviously having a lot of fun with this script as well, as the overbearing Vulcan repeatedly inserts decimals into his pronouncements and criticizes everyone for not being sufficiently precise. Also of note is the cold sore (?) that appears and reappears on the lower lip of the guest star (Scotty's love interest).

His actions and motives are mysteriously strange throughout the first 3 acts of the episode; he appears hostile at first, but then shifts his attitude to that of gracious host, unveiling his legal ward, a young female whose parents died while in Flint's employ (so he says). Kirk is immediately entranced by this girl of great intellect, who also seems very naive. By the way, the exterior shot of Flint's big castle-like house is a rerun from way back in ""The Cage,"" the 1st pilot for the show. Anyway, 'Flint,' it turns out, is just using this name as the latest in a long line; he was previously known as Da Vinci, the composer Brahms, as well as Solomon, Lazarus, Methuselah and Merlin, besides a hundred others. Spock had deduced as much after studying Flint's paintings and musical compositions, which were all created recently, using 23rd-century materials: Flint was born about 6000 years ago, on Earth. For reasons never explained, he is some kind of a mutant, an immortal - he found this out from way back in his first identity, when he recovered from a fatal wound. This backstory is somewhat familiar, used in other sf novels, series or films (""Highlander""); there was even a comic book series ""The Eternal Warrior"" much later, which itself copied a series of novels. The writer, Bixby, followed this up with the similar ""Man From Earth,"" his last work, recently made into a film, which can almost be looked on as a prequel to this episode.All this is an intriguing glimpse into the possibilities inherent in living a life made up of centuries rather than just years. The actor Daly gives a good performance as the immortal man, projecting a weariness associated with such a huge lifespan, as well as the great knowledge he must have accumulated over the millennium. It's curious that he still resorts to 'tests of power' and brute strength in certain situations, despite all that he's learned over his long life. What information can be gleaned from such a being! But, this is not where the focus of the story diverts to. I blame this on Kirk, of course. He seems unable to control his rampaging libido by this point in the series (late in the 3rd season) and I suppose it's fortunate this was just a 5-year mission: had Kirk continued in this direction for a few more years, he would have turned into some kind of crazy space-wolf Lothario. Everything shifts to Kirk's fascination with Flint's female companion in the 2nd half of the episode, an obsession that occurs in the span of a couple of hours (representing the dichotomy of such a short time frame when compared to Flint's eternal existence). Flint spent centuries working up to this moment and Kirk ruins it in so short a time - because he's a normal human being; for him, life is short, things happen fast (well, still too fast, I would say). Yes, Kirk feels towards the end - forget Flint's vast knowledge, forget the suffering crew - all that matters now is if I get the girl. Spock, usually annoying in his logical point of view, probably should have pressed Kirk even more in this episode. It's also interesting (and revealing) how protective both Spock & McCoy are of Kirk by the end, as if he's their younger brother, needing their special care, at times.",8
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Requiem for Methuselah (TV Episode 1969)",One of the best characterizations of Mr. Spock EVER,"This episode would not normally be a favorite if it were not for the exploration of Mr. Spock's character. Seemingly an auxiliary character to the plot in this episode, Spock is, in my opinion, the true focus of the writing.The episode deals with the self-exiled Methuselah, who lives apparently alone on a planet that contains a substance desperately required by McCoy for the formulation of an antidote to a deadly epidemic on-board the Enterprise. The foreground of the plot deals primarily with the acquisition of this substance, and the necessitated dealings with reluctant Methuselah in order to get it.While in Methuselah's home (who goes by the name ""Flint""), Spock takes an interest in several paintings, which he determines to be original Da Vincis, as well as discovering an original Brahms manuscript. Throughout this process, Spock expresses by implication the emotion of envy, and when offered a brandy by a teasing McCoy, he, to everyone's surprise expresses a desire to have one.Methuselah's young paramour, an android - although Kirk believes her to be human and begins to get affectionate with her - is barely on the verge of developing emotional capacity. Toward the end of the episode, she dies due to the strain of her newly developed emotions, which are divided between the two men she is determined not to hurt (their fight over her causes her too much emotional duress). Interestingly, it is Spock who gives the reason for her death - the conflict of her newly developed emotions that were too strong for her to understand and reconcile - an insight on the part of his character that shows an experiential understanding of what the struggle is really all about.The apparent focus of the episode, Methuselah, is a study in loneliness, and to what it has driven him: self-exile and the attempted creation of a perfect mate - which ultimately fails. But the nature of Methuselah's character is very thin in comparison to that of the Vulcan's. Spock, who has chosen quite the opposite of solitude, lives with the loneliness of a man who's emotions are not credited except as the butt of some joke (as when Kirk & McCoy offered him the brandy), and especially so in the final scene of the episode, when McCoy looks Spock dead in the eye and tells him how much he pities him because he will never experience all of the wonderful, courageous, painful, etc., qualities of love.) Yet for Mr. Spock, his devotion is something much subtler and deeper than McCoy (or anyone else during the episode - as he seems to be so overshadowed by the dramatics of Kirk and McCoy and even Methuselah - Spock's forced relegation to the background of the plot for the majority of the episode emphasizes his struggle to be understood - to be accepted and loved as well) can apparently grasp.As McCoy leaves the room, after expressing his wish that the guilt-worn and dozing Kirk could forget the girl (android girl) who died because of her torn love for him, Spock, in a gesture much more authentic and selflessly full of love (especially because he will never be known for his action - and this in contradistinction to all of the various surface qualities of love expressed and described throughout the episode is in fact the most authentic representation of it!), steps forward and in a quiet voice places his fingertips against the Captain's temple and utters ""Forget.""",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Requiem for Methuselah (TV Episode 1969)",He's been all those people? Really?,"Kirk and crew land on a planet to retrieve medical supplies in the midst of an epidemic, but are cordially taken captive by a Renaissance man, Flint, who has a mansion filled with art. He lives as a loner on the planet with a woman and Kirk is curious why. The mystery of it all was engaging, but the end strained credibility. I felt this episode had the following problems: 1. Flint ends up literally having been Da Vinci, Moses, Mozart, Alexander, and every other big name in history. My only reaction was: Really? What, the human race is so backwards that all the great advances and creations in history are really the work of one semi-human super being? 2. Flint has been all those amazing, honorable, people, and yet he gets in a brawl over a girl? I doubt Moses or Da Vinci would do that.3. It's not enough that Kirk falls in love with every female human and female alien he trips over, he now smothers affections on female robots too. Has that man no dignity? You half expect him by the end of the series to fall in love with monkeys in skirts. Hundreds on the Enterprise will die if he doesn't get the medicine in time, but he doesn't care because he just met an emotionless robot that is shaped like a woman. In season two, such negligence would have gotten Kirk court-martialed.4. Kirk is unbearably nosy and unmannered. He is being treated hospitably by a powerful host, and how does he repay the hospitality? By seducing his host's woman and looking behind doors that are expressly forbidden. At point of the show I was hoping Flint would toss Kirk the skunk out of his house before he stunk up the place too badly.5. Why do Flint and Kirk fight over the robot? Flint can just make a copy and give it Kirk, or even go into the secret backroom and give Kirk one of his back-up robots.",4
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Requiem for Methuselah (TV Episode 1969)",O Brave New World!,"Very rarely does a STAR TREK episode live up to the memories of fifty years ago. I saw this one as a tiny tot, and remember just swooning over the ""confession"" of the wise old Mr. Flint -- ""yes, I was Brahms. And DaVinci. And Merlin, and Alexander . . . and many, many more."" This episode is refreshing, in that the focus is not on Kirk's macho daring, but on art and music, thoughts and feelings, philosophy and loss. Kirk and the boys are amazed to meet a fascinating wise old man in the remotest possible corner of the galaxy, whose companion seems to be an adoring and cultivated young woman. But all is not as it seems! Mr. Flint has secrets, and so does his companion Rayna. Ultimately Kirk ""loses"" one of his few fights and Mr. Spock shows an unusual amount of understanding and concern for his captain's human emotions.This episode owes a lot to Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST. Mr. Flint is a retired magician, like Prospero. Rayna is as innocent and charming as Miranda -- and as eager to meet attractive men. The M4 Robot flits about running household errands, just like Ariel.But this episode goes further. ""Miranda's"" isolation has tragic costs, which Shakespeare doesn't acknowledge. And Prospero's wisdom is flawed, making him both more tragic and more human. Shakespeare's magician was rather too pure -- betrayed by his brother, by Milan, by the tiresome demands of real life. Mr. Flint is far more accomplished, and also admits to having made his own share of mistakes. This episode is everything STAR TREK ever set out to be -- original and exciting entertainment, and a doorway to new worlds of art and thought.O Brave New World!",10
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Requiem for Methuselah (TV Episode 1969)",Forbidden Planet or Forbidden Love?,"Quite a good episode overall. Jerome Bixby was, of course, a genuine SF writer, and many of the more intriguing aspects must be attributed to him. The Kirk-Rayna angle seems more a stock addition by Roddenberry/Writing Staff - anyone know the inside scoop?What struck me the most at first, was how the situation parallels the classic FORBIDDEN PLANET - A lone man. A seemingly desolate planet. A mechanical robot who protects and serves. The introduction of a lithe young woman to a trio of love starved space voyagers. The man being able to virtually at will whip up all kinds of incredible intellectual wonders beyond the capability of any one man. etc etc.Bixby (who also wrote the SF films IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE and THE LOST MISSILE amongst others), must certainly have been conscious of the similarities. Bixby takes the story in a different direction, and creates his own tale with enough twists and turns to keep one's interest. Without giving away too much, the forbidden love angle is perhaps the weakest. It just seems to play into the most simplistic stereotype of the Kirk character. Again, Bixby does his best to keep this different than what you expect at the outset.Overall, a strong episode.",
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Requiem for Methuselah (TV Episode 1969)",Requiem for a series,"Arguably the last good episode of Star Trek (""All Our Yesterdays"" features an interesting plot line with Spock and Mariette Hartley), ""Requiem for Methuselah"" is among the more literate scripts the series offered. Jerome Bixby demonstrates his considerable science-fiction writing ability in his well-drawn Flint character, adeptly brought to life by veteran TV actor James Daly. While this episode is almost farcical in its accelerated Kirk/Rayna love-story arc, the concept of Flint as an immortal conglomeration of the some of the greatest minds in human history and Spock's gradual realization of this secret are intriguing and engaging. What also makes this episode memorable is that it stands out so far above the largely forgettable third season, and a touching scene between Kirk and Spock helps an otherwise schlocky ending. ""Methuselah"" belongs nowhere near the pantheon of the likes of ""Naked Time"" or ""City on the Edge of Forever,"" but it was a final reminder of what made the series so special.",7
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Requiem for Methuselah (TV Episode 1969)",Forbidden Planet/Tempest Redux,"Kirk, Spock, and McCoy beam down to a planet to get a substance to fight a horrible disease that has a foothold on the Enterprise crew. Upon arrival they are encountered by a robot that looks a lot like that Nomad thing from another episode. It is really kind of a disappointment (you can see a string holding it as it wiggles around) but I've learned to ignore this kind of stuff. The thing shoots at them, apparently trying to get them to return to the ship. The robot is soon joined by a handsome, grey haired man (Flint, played well by James Dailey), dressed in sort of a classic ancient Roman outfit. They tell him that they need ryetalin to treat the crew, but he refuses their request. They are ready to take what they want. The man relents and invites them into his home. In the home are art masterpieces and priceless antiques. He tells them he will have the robot process the serum for them. In the meantime, we are introduced to a beautiful young woman who is supposedly the ward of Flint. She apparently has the intellect of one with numerous degrees. She looks forward to discussing some esoteric topics with Spock. The sad thing about this episode is that Kirk comes off like an invasive jerk who is having trouble keeping his pants on. They are on a mission with a serious deadline to try to save over 400 people. What does Kirk do? He slobbers all over this young woman, ignoring his agreement to mind his manners. We are supposed to be sympathetic to him. Spock and McCoy are working their butts off to do their jobs while he moves around like some hepped up cocker spaniel. Still, the episode is remindful of the classic Forbidden Planet which is actually based on Shakespeare's ""The Tempest."" Probably the last decent episode as the series dies an appropriate death.",7
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Requiem for Methuselah (TV Episode 1969)",A compelling and highly original season 3 Trek episode,"This episode was penned by Jerome Bixby and is one of the highlights of Star Trek's trouble filled third season. After watching 'Requiem for Methuselah,' I must admit that it is one of my favourite season 3 shows. I can see why it is assigned a high favourable rating of about 8.3 out of 10 here. There was a lot of magic in this episode. James Daly's and Louise Sorel's performances as the tired, lonely Flint and the innocent android Rayna were excellent. Everyone knows that Kirk was getting a bit high on his testosterone level in many third season TOS scripts--which were often penned by female writers who cared more about personal relationships than adventure. However, Bixby actually used this to boost the storyline of 'Requiem to Methuselah.' Flint hates the presence of the Enterprise trio (Kirk, Spock and McCoy) who beamed down onto his planet for ryetalyn to cure the Enterprise crew from Rigellian fever. But he soon changes his mind when he sees how Kirk can bring Rayna's ""emotions alive."" Basically, Flint uses Kirk to let Rayna experience the feeling of love so that he can have Rayna for himself later. Kirk follows Flint's subtle suggestions to play pool and dance with Rayna and quickly falls in love with Rayna. Yes, it was a bit farcical to see Kirk implore Rayna, a woman he barely knows, to stay with him with this classic line: ""Childhood must end. You love me, not Flint!"" Kirk didn't know that Flint was monitoring his every move. Once Kirk has accomplished his host's goal, Flint chillingly says: ""A last tender encounter Captain Kirk to end your usefulness."" Obviously, Flint has something up his sleeve and its definitely not just to say goodbye to Kirk, Spock and McCoy. Spock rightly suspects something is wrong and tells Kirk that their host is delaying their stay on his home for unknown reasons. Spock surmises--correctly--that Flint knows Brahms, da Vinci and countless other personalities to create his exquisite collection of paintings and musical masterpieces. When Flint delays the transfer of ryetalyn to the Trek trio and basically compels them to enter his secret room with its models of other Raynas, his intentions become clear: he wants to hold them in stasis with the Enterprise for a thousand years. Spock is in his element with this late Classic Trek episode. He's the first person to realise that Flint will never let them leave his home since they have discovered his secret--immortality--and the first to tell Flint that Rayna would hate him for holding the Enterprise crew in stasis. This is the brilliant Vulcan we have come to expect, not the one who couldn't distinguish who the real Kirk was in 'Whom Gods Destroy.' Murray Golden did a great job directing the only Classic Trek episode he ever touched. This episode was a very smooth flowing film with little slow paces. Bixby's idea that an android could experience feelings and think for herself was extremely intriguing and original in the 1960's. Louise Sorel's portrayal of the innocent Rayna who suddenly experiences the complex conflicted feelings of love and jealousy only to fall apart when she cannot compensate for her newfound emotions for both Kirk and Flint was first rate. Sorel really brought the Rayna character to life. The main plothole was why Kirk would fight Flint over an android? I appreciated Kirk's comments that Rayna had the right to ""do and think as she wills"" even if it meant forcing Rayna to choose him over Flint but, as Spock logically notes, Rayna was not a woman. This show, which first aired on St. Valentine's Day in 1969, may have broken some viewer's hearts but it made for compelling sci-fi TV. Its just a pity that Kirk didn't fight Flint before he found out that Rayna was an android! Its hard to criticise this unique season 3 TOS episode despite its small faults. Only Jerome Bixby could write such an unorthodox, original--for the 1960s--and poignant script like 'Requiem for Metheselah.' This was Star Trek at its very best. I give an 8 out of 10 overall for this episode which was not perfect but very good nonetheless.",8
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Requiem for Methuselah (TV Episode 1969)",Kurt Falls For An Android Virgin,"This seems to be an overall higher rated episode among other IMDb reviewers and I won't disagree, it's pretty good. But lets face the facts, Kirk has dissed other chicks hotter than this one but he wants to take this one on the Enterprise? And she's a virgin who never kissed? And she's, like 18? OK heres another one, shes an android. Give me a break. Oh and the 6,000 year old dude has a device that makes the enterprise a toy and suspends the crew into a freeze state. I love when Kirk says, you used me, LOL. Kirk says he loves her when they knew each other for like 4 hours? LOL. OK maybe this episode benefits from being among some really crappy episodes and peoples expectations have been lowered. The last scene aboard the ship is what elevates it a notch, McCoys great dialog here talking to Spock about Jim's angst over losing his android genius virgin, ""You wouldn't understand would you, Spock? You see I feel sorrier for you than I do for him, because you'll never know the things that love can drive a man to...the ecstasies, the miseries, the broken rules, the desperate chances, the glorious failures, and the glorious victories. All of these things you'll never know, simply because the word ""love"" isn't written into your book. Good night Spock"". Than Spock gets into Jim's head (again, I think as he did before when Jim was an Indian in ""The Paradise Syndrome"", I could be mistaken, I'm not going to research it now), and puts the thoughts, ""forget"" as Jim is really cracked up over losing this ""woman"". I was always entertained by this episode so I'm giving it a 7 of 10. There are still about 3 memorable episodes remaining before the crew would end their televised mission. LLAP",7

In this film, professor John Oldman reveals that he has been alive for 14,000 years. What kind of life would that be?

And while Kirk may already be jaded for having to bear responsibility for his crew and at least 5 million colonies for the zillionth time, that is still no excuse for the way his private member behaves throughout this hormonally-driven episode.Kirk's crew is dying, and the nearest cure is on a planet called... whatever. Kirk beams down with Spock and McCoy, and you'd think Kirk would only focus on getting the ""illubirium"" (or whatever silly name they'd concocted for the substance that will stop the plague). Well, think again: so professional is Kirk that he ends up willfully jeopardizing the mission because he falls for a floozy that turns out to be an android (how original). Nevermind that hundreds are about to die within an hour: KIRK WANTS SEX!... NOW! Worse yet, Kirk and his blue-shirted buddies are greeted by a highly suspicious, unfriendly character, so obviously Kirk would be careful as to what he does? Wrong. Kirk, a mere guest on the premises, smooches the girl in front of everyone, including the host, knowing full well she might be the old geezer's love-interest. Kirk later plays dumb, acting all surprised when Spock tells him that ""Methuselah"" is in love with the space bimbo. Kirk can't be that dumb, or is he really? Well, when the penis does all the thinking, anything's possible.The cheesy episode ends with a rather silly fisticuff struggle between the old geezer and Kirk, both guided by their genitals, sort of remote-control-style. Forget the dying crew, forget the plague, let's just nail that sexy sexy babe, Kirk must have been thinking.I didn't quite understand why the Federation doesn't simply fire his ass after this abysmal display of childishness.In the end, Kirk finds himself is in such a cataclysmic midlife-crisis state of mind, that he starts falling into depression because he is so in luurve. (He even ends up falling asleep while talking to Spock!) Spock does a mind-meld on Kirk's sexed-up brain to make him forget the blond robotic tart, and everyone's happy. (A mind-meld on the viewers might have helped us forget the asinine plot-twists.) The conclusion: Kirk must have already bonked all the women aboard the Enterprise, because how else do we explain his sudden falling in love on some planet when he's got a hundred women, all slim and sexy, to choose from on his own ship. He must have had them all, tiring of them, hence looks elsewhere for fun.""Methuselah"" is grief-stricken over his gal short-circuiting after she can't decide which one to have sex with, him or Kirk. This guy has the power to turn the Enterprise into a Toys'r'us plaything, and yet he can't make more of these tarts?... Whoever wrote this 60s nonsense gave him typical StarTrekkian god-like powers, but expects us to believe that he isn't competent enough to make a whole bunch of androidal bimbos that are just as blond as the one he'd lost. Besides, couldn't he just repair this one? ""Methuselah"" could have simply made two more, one for himself and one for Kirk to carry back to his ship and have fun with in the privacy of his quarters. In such a scenario, Spock's mind-meld would have been unnecessary.RFM is a concoction of older episodes: start with ""The Squire of Gothos"", mix in some ""What Are Little Girls Made Of?"" and ""I, Mudd"", and add a bit of ""Metamorphosis"" for good measure. For more clichés, steal a bit from Twilight Zone episode ""Long Live Walter Jameson"", and you're done.All that said, don't get me wrong: this is another fun episode. 60s television can get away with a lot...",

As I continue to venture my way through season three, I find myself frequently coming across the ""manwhore"" Kirk that everyone seems to talk about. Frankly, I am not a fan. The fact that Kirk enjoys his alien ladies is fine, but first and foremost he is a starship captain. I mean come on man, have a little self respect!Its made worse by the fact this chick of the week is in fact a android who is only on the verge of developing emotions, and Kirk is determined to risk his life, as well as the crews, for this girl after just looking at her. I guess she was just that hot, although I imagine things might get tricky down the road, her being an android and all.The back half of this episode I found myself pleading for Kirk to stop being such a freaking moron, forget the pootang, and get up to the ship and save the crew. Try to remember that your crew and your good friends are suffering an agonizing disease and death is inevitable. There were plenty of chances to escape at the end, but it took the death of a hot robot to determine when to leave.The rest of the episode is quite good however. Spock has some great moments including him loading up on some brandy and admitting that he's on the verge of an emotional reaction. I also enjoy the idea that Leonardo Da Vinci and Socrates were all in fact the same immortal dude. It was interesting and well thought out. But oh man those love scenes are torture to sit through.

Actually, the idea of a 6,000 year old man (who goes by ""Flint"") who has actually been some of the most prominent figures in Earth history IS interesting, but Kirk falling in love with Flint's robot/companion Rayna (and in record time no less) was just plain dumb.The one thing that makes this episode stand out somewhat in the disappointing third season is a fine performance by James Daly as Flint, who, after all he's been through over the millennia, now simply wants his privacy. Also, Flint's home is one of the best sets in the entire series (amazing given Season 3's budget constraints), with great attention to detail. It lends credibility to Flint being several important figures out of history (the ""Brahms"" piece was a nice touch..very pretty). Oh, and there's also a story line about an outbreak of Rigelian Fever aboard the Enterprise, which seems to be more or less background fodder since we see no evidence of any epidemic on the ship when Kirk is communicating with Scotty.My 5 is actually a 5 1/2.

It is imperative that Kirk, Spock, and McCoy get enough of the mineral before time runs out. They run into a snafu: Flint (James Daly), a superior intellectual, powerful, who, at first, tells the trio to leave his planet or die, but Kirk refuses. After a standoff, Flint agrees to let them stay, and even has a robot of his help collect the mineral for McCoy. Flint has a ""companion"", Rayna (Soap Opera veteran Louise Sorel of ""Days of Our Lives"" fame), who is almost his equal in intellect, with a knowledge of science, history, and the arts, having learned everything from her mentor. There's a window of time the trio have and Flint, with reasons, keeps them from getting the serum earlier (for instance, a chemical within the first batch of the serum causes it to become inert and worthless for inoculation), and they concern Rayna. There are reasons Rayna acts peculiar, struggling with ""new feelings"", blank eyes, as if a void of emotion keeps her from truly behaving human. It could be that she has never met humans besides Flint, who doesn't have a history according to Enterprise records/databanks or have readings that register on the tricorder. Who Flint and Rayna are, and how Kirk is brought into a love triangle, is the meat of the story in ""Requiem for Methuselah"". I must admit that I found Shatner's performance robotic (pun intended; you get the joke if you have seen this episode), as we are supposed to sympathize with Kirk who falls in love with Rayna (it's one of those ""love at first sight"" scenarios where their eyes meet and they are smitten), with certain complications that could threaten the Enterprise crew. Love is a topic covered in depth and there's one marvelous scene where McCoy deftly explains how sorry he feels for Spock who cannot understand all such an emotion entails. Sorel has never been more lovely, although it must have been her Rayna's beauty that caught Kirk's attentions and devotion, not any form of a personality, because there isn't one (not a fault of the performance she is *suppose to* act this way) present throughout. Daly is decent as the lonely and suffering Flint, who has collections of DaVinci and Pollack, works of great pianists, that look authentic yet are not cataloged much to Spock's amazement (well, amazement conveyed by an unemotional Vulcan who admits he's envious of Flint's collection of art and works), with quite a *history* (his background is quite extensive and explains the collections once the mystery is unveiled), longing for something involving Rayna. Seeing the character Kirk suffer from the loss of love is fascinating and the Vulcan mind meld at the very end as Spock peers into his buddy's tortured psyche is probably the best scene in the episode. Probably one of the best episodes of the dysfunctional third season of the classic series.",7

Later, however, the three meet his 'ward'--a beautiful and intelligent (but still rather emotionally bland) lady. Of course, Kirk being a galactic super-stud, he falls in love with her and Flint becomes jealous. And, their hormonal difficulties nearly jeopardize their mission.While I don't want to describe all the plot, as this could impair your appreciation of the episode, what I thought was great was how Flint turned out to be an immortal who has lived and loved for a very long time. He had lived on Earth and had been many famous celebrities (such as Brahams) but pretended to age and faked his own death--only to create a new identity. The shear knowledge and greatness of the man was astounding. Unfortunately, the sexy ward angle and his battle with Kirk in many ways detracted from an astounding idea.",8

Anything with a faded Roman God or such ends up being a stupid episode. This is no exception. A 6,000 year-old man ends up being the embodiment of art and music, everyone from Rembrandt to Mozart and Michelangelo to Shakespeare. He lives in a mansion on a mysterious planet, with a beautiful young woman who turns out to be an android (Has this been done before? Sure!) This blonde ""Barbi"" has so much hair on her obvious wig that it looks like her skinny neck could snap from all the weight (really big hair). She's incredibly intelligent and drop-dead gorgeous, of course. ""Nomad"" makes a guest appearance as well. The rest of the story: Kirk stops by to borrow some rare and precious medicine for an infectious outbreak somewhere. Only a few hours remain and millions of lives ""hang in the balance"". (Phew!) True to character, the good captain wants to ""leave his mark"" and a simple kiss just won't do. Kirk fights with the world's oldest man, and the girl short circuits like a cheap watch, as she loves them both. Very predictable and very forgettable. Sometimes I think the name of the series should have been ""How I Met Your Alien Mother"".",5

Flint calls off his robot, Flint wants them to leave but Kirk refuses calls Scotty and has him to standby with ships phasers to kill all 4 of them. Then when McCoy explains that the seriousness of the illness is like the bubonic plague that struck Constantinople in 1334. Flint gives them 2 hours to get the Ryetalyn with the help of his robot M4. Flint invites them back to his place while M4 gathers the mineral needed. Spock takes readings which shows the building's materials are more modern and not ancient. Flint's ward, Rayna, wants to meet them and she is interested Spock for his physics knowledge but Flint is interested in Rayna. M4 has the Ryetalyn and McCoy examines it to find it's useless, it is contaminated with irilium. Now they must find out what Flint's game is, why Rayna is there, find good Ryetalyn, get back to the ship to make the cure and get their crew well.Not a bad episode at all.

19,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Requiem for Methuselah (TV Episode 1969)",One shining moment,"The flaws in this episode are readily apparent, and listed by other reviewers. The main dramatic plot device is inert (""The Ryetalin is ready."" ""NO IT'S NOT!"" Repeat.); Twilight Zone's ""Walter Jameson"" did it earlier and better; after bedding every female in the galaxy, Kirk is ready to throw it all away for an android he met two hours ago; oh, and let's play 'Art Lovers' while the entire ship dies of Rigelian fever. But where Trek Season 3 is concerned, you take your pleasures where you find them. I love Spock's performance in this episode. His genuine adoration and (gulp) joy at finding authentic undiscovered masterpieces by Brahms and Da Vinci is wonderful. But my favorite and most poignant moment is the final scene. What Spock does is totally unethical -- surreptitiously messing with his Captain's mind, even if nobody will ever know. When I was eight years old I couldn't understand why Captain Kirk needed to forget anything, especially after only four hours on the planet. Now, decades later -- having loved and lost several times myself -- this is the sort of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" memory cleanse that I'd probably have paid for several times over. What a controversial yet loving gift. Watching that scene makes me feel 40 years younger, overcome with nostalgia and well-earned understanding.",7

As the story unfolded I could see the conflicting emotions of both and the tragic denouement as the android Rayna, who had learned not only human emotions but also human desires such as the right to choose, self-destructed because she could not cope with this new knowledge. Question: who is better off---Flint, now no longer immortal but who can continue to do good works as he lives out his normal lifespan, or Kirk, at first thoroughly disconsolate over the loss of still another woman in his life but then recovering his emotional equilibrium thanks to a powerful psychological save by his second in command who demonstrates just how much he cares for his commanding officer?

The Captain wants to run off with an android, and doesn't even seem to be embarrassed by the idea that he kissed one, much less whispered sweet nothings into her ear. After so many years of roaming the space-ways, the Captain may have finally lost it.And what about Spock? Hand him a hundred year old Saurian brandy and he's experiencing envy over Flint's (James Daly) da Vinci collection. There were many other episodes in which Spock's emotional component might have been challenged, but this didn't seem to be one that would have elicited that kind of response. But it was fascinating.However I liked the concept of this show - the idea that an immortal might have lived a life as a series of famous Earth men - scientist, inventor, musician, artist - each life building on the one before and acquiring a vast reservoir of human knowledge. I was surprised to see a reference by reviewer Bogmeister to Valiant Comic's Eternal Warrior character. Though he was never an historical figure throughout his life, he passed through the millennia in proximity to the famous and the infamous, and was one of my favorite comic characters.With only a few more shows left to close out the third and final season, it's no secret that the episodes were getting kind of weak. Though this one had some moments, like McCoy's soliloquy to Spock on the merits of love, overall I couldn't help wondering in amazement what the writers were putting Kirk through with essentially, a twenty third century version of a blow up doll. In their perplexed state, they didn't even get the character's name right in the credits, where Louise Sorel was listed as Reena, while in the story she was Rayna.Which led me to thinking, maybe what Captain Kirk needed was something to keep his mind focused. Instead of mining the planet Holberg 917G for Ryetalyn, the crew probably should have been on the lookout for some good old fashioned Ritalin. Did they have that in 1969?",7

Kirk, Spock and McCoy beam down to a planet to obtain a drug to cure the crew of a fatal disease, but the lone inhabitant says no. Kirk then threatens him by saying they'll take it by force if they have to (unlike the kinder, gentler Kirk at the beginning of the episode ""Mirror, Mirror"" who is okay with the inhabitants refusing to give the crew desperately needed Dylithium crystals). This episode then drags on the rest of the way, becoming a Shatneresque overacted love story between Kirk and an android. The idea that Flint is a ton of famous people from Earth's past is just way too farfetched as well. This episode is simply the dullest one made and a complete yawner.",2

You'll have to listen carefully - but it is there.Either the producers didn't have enough money for their own effects or perhaps they were making an acknowledgement to the film.Anyway it's a very good episode on par with many from the previous series.,8
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Way to Eden (TV Episode 1969)",A missed opportunity for insight into an era,"I agree with other reviewers that this is a poor example of original Star Trek, but for different reasons. It's quite clear that the scriptwriters or producers were hostile to the youth culture movement of the day. The ridiculous way the space hippie tribe is depicted make them little more than a caricature. Worse, they are shown exhibiting all the behaviour of cult members. This is hardly what the hippie movement was about. Most were just looking for a way to reconnect with the planet. Here they are shown as delusional and even dangerous, which of course is the way authorities saw them in the '60s. Fortunately the scriptwriters make Spock an excellent foil to this all-out hostility toward anyone who questions authority. (Was that Roddenberry's contribution?) If there's a redeeming quality to this episode, it's Nimoy's performance. That the most logical mind in the universe could fully understand the urge to find a way to create a better society proves it's hardly a delusional concept. How else does the human species progress, but by striving for better? Ignore the snarls of the social Darwinists. They just want excuses for their bad behaviour. In reality there were many complex social factors that created the ferment that was the 1960s —a protracted, bloody war; a suddenly booming economy; higher education for the masses for the first time in history; an incredible explosion of creative genius in most of the arts; racial tensions; emerging gender equality, etc. etc. etc. To oversimplify the stated aims or visions of such a generation is to do them a grave injustice. To depict them as foolish, deluded children is just plain ignorant. After all, Roddenberry pushed the envelope from the very start of Star Trek. That was hardly establishment thinking. In his own modest way he was as much a part of the social changes sweeping society as any of the other change agents. For a start, he showed women as capable, professional, highly competent and intelligent—besides being sexy. Just look at what else was being made in television and film at the same time and see how many shows you can say that about. I mean, besides Rod Serling and The Twilight Zone. So as songwriter Nick Lowe once said, ""What's so funny about peace, love and understanding?"" Is it attainable? Who knows? Probably not. Does that mean we stop trying? ""A man's reach must exceed his grasp or what's a heaven for,"" the poet Browning reminds us. Which is precisely what Roddenberry's Star Trek was all about. Reaching further. Either Roddenberry stumbled on this one, or Heineman had a bad hair day. Or the producers just didn't get it.",6

He also has contracted some kind of biological contagion and as Leonard Nimoy observes, he's quite mad. But Nimoy also kind of connects with Homeier's followers.Not that they don't have a goal in mind, it's to reach a mythical planet called Eden which is not unlike the Garden Of Eden featured in our Abrahamic monotheist religions.The rub here is that they reach Eden, but the Creator/Deity has put something in the life on Eden that will truly take care of the infestation of civilization as Homeier and several followers find out to their regret.An interesting and timely episode taking advantage of a trend in our culture.",6

You can't have EVERY episode result in Shatner's shirt being mysteriously ripped off in an epic one-on-one battle with the alien of the week. Sometimes you just need to see Spock having a jam session with some weird hippie types instead. Alright, maybe it's just because I have a not-so-secret crush on Spock, but that was probably one of my favorite scenes in the series. Sure, it's a little campy, but that's half of the show's appeal.

4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Way to Eden (TV Episode 1969)","You have a hard lip, Herbert","There were plenty of stinkers during ST's final season, but the designation for All-Time Worst Episode usually comes down to a choice between 'Spock's Brain' and 'The Way To Eden.' 'Spock's Brain' might best be described by the question, ""what would happen if Ed Wood directed an episode of 'Star Trek?'"" 'The Way To Eden,' on the other hand, is the show trying desperately to be 'hip' and contemporary, with painful results. A short plot re-cap pretty much says it all- six space hippies hijack the Enterprise to take them to the planet Eden. Kirk is the rigid, unyielding authority figure that they mock by calling him 'Herbert.' Spock is the cool go-between, because he and the hippies 'reach.' Chekov was once in love with one them, the beautiful Irina, before she 'dropped out.' The mind reels at some of the scenes present here, like the jam session which Spock takes part in. Charles Napier, of all people, plays Adam, lead singer (and sort of lead guitarist) for the hippies. Yes, this is the same Charles Napier who would later appear as a redneck cowboy in 'Blues Brothers' and a police officer/dinner morsel for Hannibal Lecter in 'Silence of the Lambs,' among many other roles. Some of his lines are priceless, like ""He's not Herbert!"" and ""It would sound!"" But it is his many songs that are burned into one's brain forever. Eden turns out to be a deadly planet, because all of the plants there contain 'acid.' (How trippy is that?) And at the show's close, Kirk turns to his first officer and says, as only William Shatner can, ""We... reach, Mr. Spock."" What an appropriate final line for a real howler of an episode.",1
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Way to Eden (TV Episode 1969)",Space hippies can do no wrong.,"This episode is probably Star Trek's worst. Aside from the basic weirdness of 1960's hippies in 23rd century space, this episode managed to insult everyone. People who are sympathetic to hippies are insulted by this episode's exaggerated portrayal of hippies as aimless, clueless, cult-like, misbehaving children. People who are annoyed by hippies are insulted by this episode because they are watching characters that are annoying. Worse still, the crew acts like hippies are cool and engaging. When a rebellious band of thugs steals a ship, spreads disease because they don't like vaccines, and foments chaos on your ship, you throw them in confinement. But instead, Kirk keeps pardoning them of their offenses, let's them have free rein of the ship, buys into their delusions of Eden, and even let's them put on a folk concert. Why? Because hippies are cool. That seemed to be the message of this episode: if you're cool (have tattoos and play the guitar), then you can get away with any crime.One of the low points of the whole series is when Spock has a musical jam session with the hippies for no reason at all. It had nothing to do with the plot and was painful to watch. I have heard others say that this episode is supposed to be funny; a kind of fish-out-of-water humor with hippies on a military spaceship. I did not find it funny. Watching malcontents be disrespectful and adolescent jerks is not funny to me. It was just painful to watch the capable and honorable Kirk submit to denigration at the hands of brainless adolescents for no apparent reason.Like so many other third-season episodes, this one seemed like a desperate plea for a new audience. Throw hippies on the show and maybe hippies will start watching the show. Throw Abraham Lincoln haphazardly into a story and maybe the history buffs and conservatives will start watching the show.",1

While stock versions of hippie counter culture folks and themes are used, it is not some mindless hippie love or hate fest, though it had scenes of intense hippie corniness with bad folk style music & vocals, and extravagant psychedelic day glow fashions. Star Trek was always hip to the current trends and if they didn't have at least one episode like this, in the height of the anti-war Woodstock days, they would have been neglectful. It certainly is a lot more sympathetic to hippies than a contemporary right wing talk show crackpot raving about evil godless communist hippies. The episode brought up some useful questions about how even the enlightened and far more humane and just future may be sterile, depressing and boring to some. It also captured the mindset of some of the demented radical types; renegade intellectuals and Scientists, who found a niche in those movements. It had some comedy, some drama and some insight. It wasn't one of the best episodes but far from the worst, I say 6 out of 10 in the scale of ST episodes.

To be sure, there were prior episodes in which the series introduced signature elements from the era (#3.5 - 'Is There in Truth No Beauty?' for it's psychedelic effects), but this one appeared to take the hippie movement head on. With it's emphasis on brightly colored attire and a staged sit-in aboard The Enterprise, Roddenberry and his writers were definitely making a statement about the peace and love generation in an outer space context.But in the execution, this has got to be one of the most embarrassing stories for the players themselves. I wonder what actor Charles Napier must have been thinking when he strapped on those knee high leather go-go boots to give it a whirl as the free wheeling lead man for the Aurora Six. Come to think of it, as far as his manner of speech went, Adam sounded more like a beatnik than a hippie, so the story actually had two generations covered. Yeah, brother, yeah.But you know, if I was reviewing this episode just a few weeks sooner, I wouldn't have been able to make the following observation. Considering Dr. Sevrin's (Skip Homeier) rants against authority and rejection of sterilized atmospheres, didn't he come off a lot like the Charlie Sheen of his day? You could blame it on the old synthococcus novae, but hey, maybe he had a touch of the old tiger blood. You never know.Well, credit Spock for keeping things in perspective here.

The ""hippie"" characters in this episode were similar to some other conservative ""hippie"" portrayals at the time--we all knew real hippies didn't act that way, and we didn't really know where certain people in Hollywood got the idea for this kind of portrayal, though once they got it into their heads, it became ingrained in the minds of certain writers and directors for a while, as what you should do when you needed to portray a rebel. Some people in Hollywood have always been big on recycling characterizations, and simplification.",2
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Way to Eden (TV Episode 1969)",Hippies in Space rename Kirk...Herbert!,"Though I cannot in good conscience give this one more stars, due to the ridiculous tone during most of the episode, it does have its charms in places. As mentioned elsewhere, unless you're very, uh, stiff, this one will elicit some laughs from you. Kirk beams aboard a group of radicals from a fleeing ship. Barely dressed, they have rejected the sterile trappings of future civilization, seeking the mythical planet of Eden (now that I think about it, they would have done well to find Apollo's planet in ""Who Mourns For Adonais?""). One of these hippies is Chekov's ex-girlfriend, from his academy days - it's amusing when Kirk learns of this; in fact, Shatner is amusing in most of his scenes here. Like several other 3rd season escapades, this attempts to capture the mood and spirit of the decade's (the '60s) relevant topics and, as a result, has become one of the more dated episodes. The interstellar hipsters use future slang such as 'you reach, brother?' and call Kirk 'Herbert' - a derogatory term - when he starts speaking of rules and regulations. It comes across as quite silly now, and probably also sounded silly 35 years ago, and viewers were probably also laughing at these scenes 35 years ago.The episode tries to come up with insightful explanations for the antics of these flower children of outer space. Spock, of all people, er, Vulcans, relates best to these troublemakers because he understands about being alienated from your own society. However, this episode may have knocked Spock down a peg or two in the eyes of some fans; when he joins the band of free-spirited kids in a jam session of sorts, you expect him to place beads on his head in the next scene and join these punks in their wilderness Shangri-La. Thankfully, that didn't happen. In fact, the best scene is when Spock gets a cold splash of reality and tells Kirk that the leader of this band, a former scientific researcher, is insane. It's also kind of interesting that the motivations of a couple of these radicals are revealed to slightly veer from the main group, showing that everyone, as usual, has their own agenda. But, many scenes are cringe-worthy indeed, perhaps the most embarrassing to watch of the entire series. Most of the singing (by cast-against-type Napier) and shouting by the group of nutcases falls into this category. The climax does have a dark ironic tone, as well it should, as we tend to forget that it actually takes place on a planet somewhere in the Romulan Zone! It also attacks the entire concept of the biblical Eden, but this subversive message is lost amid all the attacks on the authority of the 'Great White Captain upstairs.'",4

They steal a space cruiser (resembling a Tholian starship), and go into Romulan space. This episode actually holds up better now as a mid 40's man going through my own life experiences and that of questioning whats the point of it all, plus the singing parts are pretty unique and cool in my book, Trek does need some variety and the endless evil computers get's old after awhile. This episode I'm sure is hated by most Trekkies (myself excluded) but I look at the broader picture to give this show some credibility, Trek needs some variety to make it the show it was. The show was trying to get some ratings, it had NEVER cracked the top overall 30 for its 3 seasons, and NBC put it on at 10 pm on Friday nights, wiping out all its under age 15 audience (unlike now, there were mostly one TV per household than and thats when the adults would watch stuff like, who knows what but probably not Star Trek), so I guess they were trying for teens and up a little here. But also, this show at times made episodes based on the social climate and this episode definitely reflected those times. In the end the (in essence) elitist liberal white guy fails to grasp that the universe and in contemporary society, world, do not all have the idealism of western whites, and this shows when he takes the Enetrprise into the hostile territory of the Romulans (what some have said represented the Chinese), although we don't see any of the Romulan threat, it's there. Gives credence from a Trek viewpoint that you are free to express yourselves to a point and it is the military that ultimately protects those rights for you. Some observations now, Uhura is missing from the bridge again (and episode), replaced by the blonde woman (I don't think a guy was ever communications officer, I wonder why?) that I saw in another episode, not sure but I guess Nichols had another project she was working on, or maybe they didn't want her to ""get down"" like the other crew did. Uhura looked kind of worn out in season three (her hair especially), she had really small parts (other than the kissing episode), the writers didn't do her much justice. The antagonists wear what looks like a fried egg on their lapels, also, no charges were filed to the survivors after all the bad deeds and transgressions they did; ultimately this is a forgiving universe. Also, if you go onto a military vessel today, chances are a room like auxiliary control will have a door lock requiring a password, something the future should have taken note of as that seems to be an important room! I'm giving this a 9 of 10, its a great change of pace episode and thats the key to what made Trek so lasting in my opinion. We are one, LLAP.",9

If anyone rather not think of the Manson killings as inspiration for TREK - or anything:""You're correct to be concerned, but also - be assured.""WAY TO EDEN aired Feb 1969. The Manson murders, August. TREK didn't borrow from such a shocking event apparently. It had no idea it was gazing into its own crystal ball. Rather, the show simply had its narrative finger on the pulse of its era, observing the shape of things so astutely that - here it ended up hitting too close to reality for comfort, as if unwittingly prophetic - by surprise.WAY never meant to forecast such dark doings as the Manson murders. But such twists are hardly unprecedented in the course of human events. As poets throughout the ages put it, truth is stranger than fiction. Whatever imagination can conjure, reality can out-do.That any such sequence as this episode dramatizes was about to come true, with fallout worse than as fictionally imagined - one catches a chill to ponder. TREK never set out to play Fortune Teller unawares. It only meant to entertain with an imaginary far future. Not a real and nasty one dead ahead - mere months away, and not so far from Paramount studios - a premonition too close for comfort.Compared to its real life 'evil twin' the following August TREK serves up a less horrifying, senseless and violent finale - yet tinged with tragedy just the same. ""His name was Adam.""In dark light of 20/20 hindsight where this episode resembles some unwitting near-prophecy of doom - the warmth and humanity of TREK really shines thru as it engages such sensitive issues as ""the kids these days"" - The Generation Gap (as then designated): ""Spock - explain!""The command character dynamic is in top form here. Kirk expresses the era's sense of confusion, what perspective to put such matters into. Spock with his Vulcan virtue and keen eye, comes out nearly Buddha-like, all compassionate wisdom and humanity - elevating the script to a level well above the trappings of its low-budget production cheesiness.The cult leader, as he affirms, is a madman. But not the young followers, who are mainly exploited, manipulated.As Spock puts it: ""There's no insanity in what they seek"" - idealistic wishes of troubled youth for ""harmony and understanding, sympathy and trust abounding"" - per lyrics of the 1960s rock opera ""Hair"" - among the clearest inspirations for this episode.Unlike the Manson murders which match the story line so eerily - ""Hair"" did not come after this episode, thus was not inspired by it. Other way around.And that brings up this episode's dynamite musical score and bravura vocal performances by guest stars - another compelling entertainment distinction among the treasures of TREK. Its evocation of late sixties San Francisco rock theater, 23rd century style, sets this voyage apart from the rest.For one impromptu instrumental they perform, depending how it strikes the ear - beware Paul Butterfield Blues Band, their album 'East-West' (title track especially).Compared with real life Aug 1969, WAY TO EDEN offers a less frightening more uplifting note - amid tragic loss, a deeper connection. As Kirk wraps it up: ""We reach, Mr Spock.""This episode is driven by issues of the 1960s psychedelic era and 'generation gap,' in fantasy- fictionalized form. That real life should follow suit after, especially so soon, leaves a viewer able only to ponder whether one has undergone a transporter malfunction - perhaps entered some sort of parallel universe - as thru a glass darkly.",10
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Way to Eden (TV Episode 1969)",Hippies take over the show and Spock drops acid (or so it seems),"The episode opens with a group of futuristic hippies being apprehended by the Enterprise after they stole a shuttle craft and went in search of Eden!! The group is lead by a guy who looks like he's gotten an ear transplant from an Indian elephant--he also happens to be nuts. Among his hippie followers is a girl who once loved Chekov as well as a guy who seems attracted to Spock and vice-versa (I'm not going there). Although Kirk is obviously too ""square"" to appreciate these ""free spirits"", Spock gets a sudden injection of ""coolness"" and is amazingly at-home with these vagabonds. Seeing Spock jamming with them using what looks a bit like an electric auto harp is unintentionally hilarious, as is most of the episode. And, when the hippies begin singing about Eden (""yeah, brother,...""), I find myself feeling kind of queasy! I am sure that dumb TV like this helped finally put a nail into the coffin of 60s idealism--as today's teens will only laugh until their sides hurt at the whole mess! This is my choice for the third worst Star Trek episode ever (right behind the one about Spock losing his brain and the one about the Yangs and the Coms).",2
16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Way to Eden (TV Episode 1969)",Lost its Way,"""The Way to Eden"" begins a string of episodes that almost makes Trek fans glad the series ended when it did. The premise is laughable (helping space hippies find their paradise), as is the story. Very little of what made the series such a groundbreaking one was evident as it limped toward cancellation in the final episodes, and this one is a good (or bad) example of a show that had simply lost warp capability.Leonard Nimoy, as usual, brings some humanity to Spock, as we see in him a genuine desire to help the hippies in their quest. He seems to empathize with their plight of a search for meaning in a cold universe, and it helps us understand a little more about his human/Vulcan dichotomy. There's nothing really enlightening about this quest, however. No high-minded values or flights from persecution are evident to help the viewer sympathize with the hippies.And while no series hits the mark every time, and one as far-reaching and ambitious as Trek deserves some forgiveness in criticism of those ideas that simply don't work, these final few episodes are just hard to watch.With the exception of the interesting Spock regression in ""All Our Yesterdays,"" ""Way to Eden"" clearly marks the beginning of a very disappointing end. When you review this episode together with the others that follow: ""The Cloud Minders,"" ""The Savage Curtain"" (I mean, really, a talking rock! Possibly the second-worst Trek episode just ahead of ""The Lights of Zetar"") and the final episode, ""Turnabout Intruder,"" it becomes obvious that Star Trek's creative resources were in full retreat. As they say in the TV world, the series had jumped the shark.",1
17,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Way to Eden (TV Episode 1969)",Last time I watched it was one of my favorites.,"Another reviewer commented, Star Trek was all about Kirk. He would outsmart the counter-culture figures on the show, presented in the guise of aliens or rogue factions of the Federation, correct the error of their ways, and then somewhere before or after, bed their women. It's a role Shatner would resurrect perhaps on 'TJ Hooker' playing a conservative cop. I'm not so convinced Star Trek was such a reactionary show, but since I'm a reactionary, I enjoyed seeing that in print. I've always loved the show.Not sure where 'the Way to Eden' fits into this revisionist history. I don't think the episode was intended to make fun of hippies. Maybe to exploit them for ratings, or to dispel this, 'myth'. Interesting, to this day William Shatner has a questionable reputation of sorts. Is this the 'reason'? Am I supposed to suspect William Shatner is some kind of conservative in 'real life'? Am I supposed to believe it's personal? As in 'the personal is political'? Is that what I'm supposed to think? I'm actually too close to Star Trek, too much of a fan to be able to tell.Whatever the reason for the episode, the shows producers do try and treat the hippies on the show with dignity, and make the episode as timeless as possible. You could cynically argue that the hippies on The Way to Eden are so far out there - there's little danger in treating them with a bit of dignity.Spocks character did change a bit when you think about it. He went from the stoic and reliable friend you're glad you have on your side, who was sometimes unlikeable (playing up how different Spock was with his lack of empathy and emotions could make him unlikeable) - he would seem to change, though, in discussing Earth's history. Here he would perhaps become the shows 'conscience'. Not sure what order the episodes are in really. In the Way to Eden he's the crewman who can relate best to the anarchists. I've seen this episode two or three times over about as many decades. It was always one of my least favorite episodes. Last time I watched, though, The Way to Eden was one of my favorites. Just doesn't have the power to embarrass me anymore perhaps. It's too late for that! The music is good, and it's priceless seeing Spock and the guest stars playing in a jam session. It takes place in an entertainment lounge kind of a precursor to the holodeck of Next Generation. At the end of the episode Spock tells them, ""I hope you find Eden, or make it yourselves"".A couple of reviewers on Amazon noted the movie Star Trek V is an adaption of this episode. I would never have noticed (never would have noticed that earlier thing about Kirk either). It's hard to say what the connection is. Did they set out to remake 'The Way to Eden' with Star Trek V? Or is the connection just a passing one? Most likely there's a connection. You could easily hate one and love the other, which were my feelings for a long time. Star Trek V is one of my favorites. In fact, I'm going to say it's my favorite Star Trek movie.In Star Trek V, it's Kirk and Spock who manage to escape the mind control of the Vulcan Sybok. He's a renegade mystic who takes over the ship by a kind of Vulcan suggestion, or, hippification. He convinces the crew to fly the ship through the great-barrier. He's trying to reach 'Shakari', or as Sybok says, ""Shakari... the source... Heaven... Eden... call it what you will. The Klingons call it ""Kuitu"". For Romulans it's ""Vortavor"". The Andorian word is... is unpronounceable."" In 'the Way to Eden' it's Kirk and Scotty and not Kirk and Spock who never really 'reach' the hippies in the episode. I can't pretend to know what the politics really are behind Star Trek. I do know Gene Roddenberrry (along with Issac Asimov) were 'heathen' humanists. Before their time, slightly. There was a time around 1980 or so, where, ironically, if you weren't a humanist, it was considered evil. Humanism's not a term that's used much anymore (pretty much our society is a Marxist one nowadays, at least in outlook, in my opinion anyway). I know an episode of the Next Generation 'The Neutral Zone' even had captain Picard explaining to a 20th Century Earther, who had been errantly beamed aboard the Enterprise, we don't use money any more, ""We have eliminated want"" he says. And there are certainly at least an equal number of 'liberal' episodes as 'conservative' ones, even on the original Star Trek, which I'm going to comment about on more, later. Interesting that the final episode of Star Trek, Turnabout Intruder, is about 'sexism'. I suppose when you're writing a science fiction show about the future seen all across the globe, it's easy to get a little starry-eyed. Happens to the best of us Gene! You're only human! I'm certainly not the first one to politicize Star Trek. . . And to be honest, I can't really say what The Original Series stands for, because I don't know. I don't know what the politics are for sure... left, right? Who knows... but the usual assumptions about it do show one thing. And what I'm about to say, I really should take further. I should add more to it, and in couple of different directions... what the assumptions show, is that the display of human decency is automatically assumed to be an attribute of the left.",8
18,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Way to Eden (TV Episode 1969)",His Name Was Adam,"As the man lies dead in Eden, next to a poisonous fruit, Spock offers this brilliant observation: ""His name was Adam."" I mean, just in case some stoned viewer somehow managed to miss the point they were driving home with all the subtlety of a jack hammer. I don't know which is worse: the antiquated 1969-time-capsule plot, or the embarrassing dialog. Or perhaps it's the ridiculous ""alien"" make-up, complete with your standard ""cauliflower-ear"" character.Thank goodness for ""The Omega Glory"" or this would be the worst, most embarrassing, Star Trek episode ever. Yes, even including ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield.""If you have somehow missed this episode, do yourself a favor and keep missing it.",2
19,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Way to Eden (TV Episode 1969)",One of the Low Points of Season 3,"In ""The Way to Eden"" the Enterprise intercepts a stolen space cruiser full of members of a strange, hippy-like cult looking for Eden. One of the members is the son of an important ambassador, the only thing restraining Kirk from giving them some type of punishment. The leader of the Eden seekers is a former scientist who has apparently went bad. He has some type of terminal illness that may infect lesser developed aliens he comes in contact with (a subplot that is basically dropped). Spock bonds with a fellow musician and the two turn half the episode into a music video. Chekov reunites with a former Russian love who is now part of this strange group.The group manages to briefly take control of the Enterprise, steering it into Romulan space. They take a shuttle craft and land on a planet they believe in Eden. Kirk and the gang follow them. The planet ends up being poisonous to all humanoid life. The leader refuses to leave and kills himself like the end of some Greek tragedy.Filler, filler, filler. That's all I can say about this one. The screenwriter had 15 minutes of plot developed and that 15 minutes is half-baked at best. There are so many dropped storylines. The leader's contagious disease, Sulu's interest in joining the cult, Spock understanding their mission. The only one with any type of conclusion is Chekov and his lady friend. There's a bunch of terrible folk songs and just bizarre protest-esque scenes. The screenwriter was trying to do something here with the hippy culture of the time... I'm just not sure what.",3
20,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Way to Eden (TV Episode 1969)",The single worst Star Trek TOS episode,"The Way to Eden was both a terrible Star Trek episode and, in my view, certainly the Worst TOS show ever made. Even Spock's Brain had its campy, humorous moments but this show was bad throughout! It epitomized the very depths of season 3 of TOS. The plot holes in the show are too many to count: how did a group of space age hippies manage to travel to their Eden by hijacking the Enterprise and then maneuver the large starship into Romulan space without sparking a Romulan response? Why does the young Chekov suddenly become the inflexible status quo adult personality we see here in this episode? Moreover, why would Spock, the Enterprise's second-in-command, play music with a group of social outcasts who had just stolen the Aurora spaceship and nearly violated the Federation-Romulan neutral zone? A real Vulcan would have had them thrown in the brig instead. If Eden was such a poisonous, acidic planet, how did Dr. Sevrin, the leader of this group, manage to climb a tree when logically the tree trunks should have burned his skin upon contact. But, I forgot: there is simply no logic in this episode! If DC Fontana had remained the show's script writer in season 3 of TOS, most of her original 'Joanna' storyline could have been produced as she envisioned it instead of being rewritten almost out of existence by the season 3 script staff. Its no surprise that Fontana removed her name from this show due to the disaster it became.Fontana's original 'Joanna' script--the prelude to 'The Way to Eden'--was competent: Eden is now a dead planet because its peace-loving people allowed their baser emotions to take over and destroy themselves. Fontana never mentions that Eden was located within the Romulan Empire. Chekov's love, Irina, doesn't appear either. The group of social misfits--called 'The Artists'--are actually rescued from a planet where their spacecraft crash landed. There are few plot holes and plenty of character interactions (ie. sparks) flying between Dr. McCoy and his daughter, Joanna, since the doctor realizes that she has been lying to him for the past 3 years and was not studying to be a nurse, as she had claimed. Joanna and McCoy eventually begin to reconcile at the end of the show after Joanna states that she will serve time for helping hijack the Enterprise and McCoy decides to allow her to choose whatever career she wants. In short, the show had the ingredients to be an excellent and highly personal TOS episode instead of the very depths of season 3 of Classic Trek.",1
21,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Way to Eden (TV Episode 1969)","Oh, HERBERT, you are stiff!","As a Hippy who grew up with 60's television, they got us WRONG most of the time. Especially in episodes of Quincy, Ironside, etc.But in this episode, they get a lot of things right. For one thing, the MUSIC these ""space hippies"" played, fronted by ""Adam"" (the late more-than-great Charles Napier), who was a General in the Deep Space Nine episode ""Little Green Men"" and an old Veteran in a Roswell episode. It took me a while to realize, holy cow, that's ADAM. He was good in everything, his characters changed as he got older.The songs made for this episode are great, especially ""I See You"" performed by Deborah Downey and Charles Napier themselves. That makes Napier my damned HERO, he not only could realistically play a ""hippie"", but he had a great voice. It does not say who wrote the actual music, although a trivia item suggests that Charles Napier actually wrote some of the songs he sang.Even Skip Homeier's ""Dr Sevrin"", not his first Evil Trek Character, reflects how sometimes a leader from a hippie movement could lead good people (And sometimes, people who were just plain bad all along) down a dark path. It was a reflection of things that may have, or have happened in our universe. Or, did happen in one case.But these were issues I remember from the 60's myself, because I was there. It made me question those who I would follow.Dr Sevrin may have had a legitimate gripe against the ""establishment"" imposed on him by The Federation, and maybe he even had a right to seek his own paradise planet. But the moment he decided to Murder the crew of the Enterprise, that made everything he stood for false. And Adam, Irina, and the rest of his followers, did they try to stop him? Sevrin gives a rational EXCUSE, and tries to normalize murder.Up until that point, all he had done was steal a ship and cause a small rebellion on the Enterprise. But when it comes to the idea that you should kill someone to further your agenda, Murder will OUT, ever time.And when the chips fall where they may, what you think you want is not really what you wanted in the first place, so not only did Sevrin try to kill the crew, but did so for basically nothing, except burned feet.There is a lot more going on in this episode than ""Space Hippies"". Possibly even a 'Space Manson"" - Sevrin was just one step from that. Seen in 2017, this episode may even seem a bit silly. In 1969, it was not. When I originally watched this with my parents and brother, there was no laughing at all. And, as far as depictions of hippies go, this is much better than the ones from Quincy or Ironside. Of course, back then I listened to Jimi Hendrix, so if they could have gotten a shredding guitar player to cameo on this Ep, it would have made my day.",10

The group demands to go to the planet Eden, but that planet is believed to be a myth. They must handle Tongo carefully to not upset the relationship of the Catuallans and the Federation, yet Tongo and his group disrespects authority. All hippies are medically scanned and healthy but Dr. Sevrin, is a carrier of the Synthecoccus novae virus. The virus is deadly but can be combated if vaccinated. The hippies believe that Eden will cure them - but is Eden only a fable? Groovy episode. The hippies can be quite annoying but it is a fun watch.8.5/10",8

Words alone can not express my sheer joy at ""reaching"" the profundities available in this episode. What the jam session needed, however, was a little cowbell.To be serious, my whole life I have always been Spock, sympathetic with anti-authoritarian anti-establishment impulses, but critical of the undisciplined, illogical, unscientific and cultlike approach.There is actually a lot to be learned for the ham handed writing of this episode that is applicable both to the fallacies of loony 60s mysticism and approaching Rightist authoritarianism.",10
24,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Way to Eden (TV Episode 1969)","Space Hippies! Some call it the worst Trek. Nonsense. Take a look at Assignment Earth, or Lights of Zetar for the worst.","The main idea here is a cult leader, Dr. Sevrin, that has been damaged by technology (air purifiers/artificial environments) taking a bunch of flower people to a mythical paradise, Eden. They take over the Enterprise by incapacitating the crew with a sonic dog whistle, steal a shuttle craft and end up on the planet Eden. However, the planet's vegetation is poisonous and the musician Adam is found dead after biting into an apple. A great quote from Spock ""His name was Adam"". Sevrin and the rest are found in the shuttle craft with acid burned bare feet. Sevrin runs over and takes a bit out of the poison apple and also dies. At the end Spock tells one of the women, keep searching for Eden, or make your own. Very good message and ending.One of the best aspects of this episode is the hippy music. The acting was fine by most of the main cast. Checkoff did well. Take a look at Scotty when he looks at one of his underlings as he's grooving to some hippy music, then after Scotty's look, he stops and gets back to work. Sevrin's acting was good. The rest of the guest actors did fine, but not great. They should have spent a little more time on Sevrin's background, and how he got to be a carrier of disease from technology. Also, although the music was great, it also derails the tension and dread of Sevrin's disease, and their quest to find paradise. As other's have mentioned, 60's hippy culture, of peace and love, seemed to have been hijacked by crazy cult gurus. This is far from the worst Trek. More like average. Assignment Earth is probably the worst Trek. It's not even Trek. It's a space 007 nonsense. Trek is only a side show. Lights of Zetar has some decent ideas, but overall it's a joke. Characters acting like idiots. Poor acting. Poor script. Although I liked the music, I would have rather they cut the music sections, and shown more of a sinister plot of Sevrin, maybe introducing some kind of drug or hypnotics to take over the Enterprise crew, and a few dead Redshirts. More action. That would have elevated this episode from a 6 to 8.",6
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cloud Minders (TV Episode 1969)",One of the most unfairly-panned TOS episodes,"...Yes, it is kind of like Elysium, but with different social issues.If this episode had been produced the way David Gerrold wrote the script - IE, about a three way class struggle/war, it never would have been aired. Especially with the subtle hints to Spock's illogical attraction to a Stratosian Woman, which he himself is bothered by. But I believe that Spock is not immune to meeting that one person who affects him physically, everyone meets a person like this at one time or another and as Spock is half human, he must have been having a lot of trouble with this in this episode. On the Vulcanian side, Pon-Farr only erupts every seven years, but being half human it would be rational to believe that Spock could ""perform"" out of that Vulcanian ""limit""- If in fact, Vulcanians are strictly limited to Pon Farr for gratification and do not engage in any casual ""multiplicative proclivities."" Who knows, Theodore Sturgeon never mentions this in ""Amok Time.""Most of the hits this episode took were regarding Mr. Spock, apparently openly talking about his biology to ""Droxine"" (Diana Ewing)- Which we know, is a private issue which ""Vulcanians"" (later called ""Vulcans"") are loathe to discuss outside of their Species- It is one of the most Private Issues of Vulcans. So how can Spock, who carefully guarded this issue in ""Amok Time""- Discuss it so apparently freely with a woman he does not even know? I explain it as follows:In fact Mr Spock himself excuses this - He openly admits admiration of aesthetic beauty, and that beautiful women, women of a certain type, Droxine's type - disturb him. He is obviously disturbed by Droxine, obviously attracted to her despite being half-Vulcanian, and I accept that if Spock were Biologically and Aesthetically attracted to a woman of Droxine's type, he would probably discuss it, but only with her, as she is the object of it (He would have to if wants to, Er, ""do it""). This is as close Spock gets in any Original Series or later story, of being attracted to a woman on sight. It is illogical, he knows this. In fact this episode is one of the only Original Series episodes that have Spock talking about this in his ""Log"" which is a voice-over at the very beginning of the episode- In it, he muses about the attractiveness of Droxine, her sheltered lifestyle, and how she would react if she were introduced to the Class Struggle which is even now developing under her feet. A musing that will be answered, as this very thing happens, as she reveals an almost racist bigotry against the ""Troglytes"" which live to mine the ""Zenite"" in the caves below, the Zenite which makes the cloud city Stratos rich, and that wealth is denied to the workers who mine it.The issue of Class Struggle never really gets swept under and excused as the result of ""Zenite Gas"" - The Issue of Zenite Gas merely allows the issue of the missing Zenite delivery to come to a quick resolution. Part of the Class Struggle of the planet Ardana is the false belief by the Stratos dwellers that the Troglyte Miners are somehow genetically inferior and cannot understand certain concepts, in fact Kirk finds this to be false. So his job is to prove to leaders of the sky city AND the miners why this is so.The issue is not resolved in the time period this episode encompasses, it is merely brought out into the open, and we can leave the Episode knowing that it will be dealt with, just not within the scope what we see here. We also see Spock having deal with his ""love on sight"" issue, or, How he can be attracted to a woman who is so beautiful but has such an ugly belief in her? But this is solved by Droxine herself, finally understanding why what she had been raised to believe was so wrong.I saw this when I was 10 years old, I didn't care about any of these issues when I was that age, I didn't even know about them. I was agog by the images of Stratos, shocked when the Troglyte ""Disruptor"" flung himself from the city, and of course I was also attracted to Droxine - Although at 10 years old I did not know why yet.This was one of those episodes that I loved when I was 10, and can appreciate now, now that I know about these issues.",10
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cloud Minders (TV Episode 1969)",The gas solution,"I disagree with most of the reviewers here that the ""gas"" solution is a cheat. While this may tie-up the episode too quickly and neatly in a nice little bow, it is television after all. And television before there were story arcs that continued throughout a season. But having the gas be the culprit causing the aggression and retardation of the lower inhabitants is a good beginner's start to understanding how circumstances can make others that are different from you SEEM to be inferior. In the 1960's (and even today), southern whites (and some liberals) assumed they were superior to minorities without taking into account the role poverty and mistreatment and environment play in intelligence (nutrition), attitude and behavior. Given the same even environmental/physical playing field, human beings tend to be pretty much equal not only in good qualities, but bad also. As usual, Star Trek was ahead of it's time in even attempting to address the issue.",8
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cloud Minders (TV Episode 1969)","Dig, Captain! Dig as the Troglytes Do!","The Enterprise arrives at the planet Ardana to obtain zenite, a rare mineral which they need to combat a botanical plague on another world. Kirk & Spock beam down but find themselves caught in the middle of a class struggle between the intellectual rulers dwelling in a city in the clouds, sustained by some anti-gravity technology, and Troglytes, the miners who mostly dwell in the caves on the surface of the planet, where such items like zenite are obtained. This is essentially a reworking of the elite class vs. the worker class story penned by H.G.Wells in his famous novel ""The Time Machine"" (filmed in 1960 and later versions). Extrapolating from such a premise of basic inequality, where-in the elites get all the benefits through the sweat of the workers, it proposes that, some time in the past, one race experienced an extreme branching off separation into two, though, scientifically, they are still all the same race. Kirk & Spock see them as the same, simply a division of the rich vs. the poor, but the egotistical intellectuals of Stratos, the hovering city, have come to see themselves, over the centuries, as a different, superior race.All of this is sort of summed up by Spock's voice-over as he sits in meditation in his guest room on Stratos, as images of various characters from both sides of the issue are transposed over his form. This sequence also kind of reminded me of scenes and voice-overs from the film ""Dune""(84) - another variation on depicting royalty vs. poverty in a futuristic setting. It's a fairly exciting episode from the 3rd season, especially when I saw this as a kid, with several hand-to-hand struggles, and perhaps with even an increase to the usually-lackluster budget for 3rd season episodes. The episode also does a good job of contrasting the desperate stance and attitudes of the Troglytes (variation of 'troglodyte') when compared to the superior attitudes of the elites on Stratos. On the downside, this episode would have rated at least a couple of stars higher had it adhered to the complex social problems presented. Instead, it's revealed that a gas, released when digging for zenite, causes a retardation to the brains of the Troglytes. This problem is solved with the introduction of gas masks by Kirk, which will, in turn, the conclusion suggests, eradicate the inequality on Ardana. This plot turn devolves the episode to simple escapist sf fare, away from the potentially insightful commentary on cultural inequality.",6
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cloud Minders (TV Episode 1969)",Pretty good for a later episode,"This is a pretty good episode that nearly merits a score of 8. The Enterprise arrives at a strange planet in search of dilithium crystals. The rulers of the planet live in a lovely city sitting in the clouds and they spend most of their days relaxing and thinking noble thoughts. The rest of the planet must live in the caves and work as miners and their lives totally suck. The dichotomy and basic unfairness of this isn't an issue to the people in the clouds (no big surprise) but the miners are sick of their lot in life. Plus, although no one knows it, inside the mines is Zenite gas, that makes the miners more angry and hostile. But, mediating the rebellion that erupts is something that seems impossible for the crew--especially since the cloud people are major jerks and the miners behave, when around the gas, like they are crazy. So, the Kirk-Meister, who is desperately in need of the crystals, creates an effective solution that isn't exactly in sync with the prime directive!!! All in all, an interesting episode that is quite thought-provoking.By the way, it really was pretty cool for once to see the ""hot babe"" go for Spock and not Kirk!! For once, there's a woman who wants a smart and not a studly man!",7
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cloud Minders (TV Episode 1969)",Stratos or maybe Elysium,Anyone who has seen Matt Damon's fine film Elysium will immediately recognize the parallels with his Star Trek episode. I wouldn't be surprised if the creators of Elysium were influenced by this story.The mission of the Enterprise is to get to this planet for a shipment of an ore called Zenite which will help with a biological plague on a nearby federation world. This planet has a social structure similar to the one on Earth that has developed in Elysium. The vast majority live on the surface and work in the mines taking out the Zenite. They also for the most part are not much above the evolutionary scale than Cro-Magnon Man.In the meantime an elite has built a city in the clouds called Stratos where they live at their leisure. Looks very much like Elysium and they rule and live off the other's toil.So the mission of William Shatner and others is to get that Zenite and sad to say they have to violate the Prime Directive and institute the beginnings of social change to do it. Some medical research into Zenite and its effects by DeForest Kelley certainly helps.Jeff Corey plays the first adviser of Stratos and an implacable defender of the established order. He and Shatner really can't stand each other.Think Elysium and you'll realize how far ahead of its times this particular Star Trek episode was.,7
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cloud Minders (TV Episode 1969)",Scantily clad beauties in an unequal society,"This episode sees the Enterprise going to the planet Ardana to collect a consignment of zienite which is urgently needed to stop a plague wiping out the vegetation on a nearby planet. They are invited to visit the floating city of Stratos but due to their rush Spock and Kirk beam down to the site of the mine. Just as they are talking about how cultured and intelligent the people of Ardana are they are attacked by a group on miners! The planet's leader, High Adviser Plasus, arrives and rescues them. They are taken to Stratos where they learn that while the people there may be cultured and live lives of luxury those on the surface, known as Troglytes, toil in the mines and are considered inferior. Some of these Troglytes, led by the beautiful Vanna, are rebelling against the current situation. She takes Kirk hostage but is soon captured and later tortured by Plasus. Kirk speaks in her defence which enrages Plasus who orders Kirk and Spock to return to the Enterprise. Here McCoy informs them that the zienite ore emits a gas that causes the Troglytes to be less intelligent than they might be; a simple mask could stop this. Hoping to get the ore from the Troglytes Kirk rescues Vanna and takes her to the mines; unfortunately she doesn't believe him and takes him hostage. In a desperate move Kirk has Plasus beamed to the mine and they wait for the gas to take effect.This is a pretty good episode with a decent central message as well as a reasonable amount of action. The political message isn't exactly subtle as Plasus quickly explains that the Troglytes are considered almost subhuman in a way that makes it clear that he is far less enlightened that he believes. It seemed de rigueur to have a beautiful woman in 'Star Trek' episode and this episode had two; Vanna, played by Charlene Polite, and Plasus daughter Droxine, played by Diana Ewing whose costume doesn't leave too much to the imagination. These two do a decent job as does Jeff Corey, for plays Plasus. While this is solid for the most part there were flaws; most notably when Spock casually tells Droxine about the Pon Farr; the Vulcan mating ritual the episode that covered this made it clear that Vulcans do not talk about it; certainly not with somebody they have just met. The ending is a bit of a cop out as we just have to accept that things will get better. Overall though I found this to be pretty enjoyable; certainly above average for season three.",8
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cloud Minders (TV Episode 1969)",Rich Profiteers vs Poor Hard-Workers,"Season 3, episode 21. The Enterprise is on a mission to the planet Ardana to retrieve the mineral zenite, it is in need to help stop a plague on Merak II. Kirk wants to speed things up so he and Spock beam directly to the zenite mines entrance, ignoring the High Adviser Plasus's request for them to beam to the floating city of Stratos. Kirk and Spock are the lassoed (captured) by the angry miners, a fight breaks out and Plasus shows up with some men and the miners easily back off. Kirk explains that they just wanted to pick up the zenite shipment that was suppose to be ready and Plasus explains that the Troglytes, miners, used a trick in order to get hostages to force the counsel to meet their demands. Kirk and Spock quickly learned then there are 2 classes: the cave-dwelling Troglytes that are the workers/miners who are very poor and the rich Elite cloud-living city dwellers that profit off the poor workers. Plasus requests Kirk and Spock to go to the city of Stratos and they agree. The logical Spock sees how illogical it is for the hard workers to be the poor ones while the rich ones do nothing at all but collect fine art and the profits. Kirk deals with the poor female miner that attacked while Spock deals with the young rich but naive daughter of Plasus. Kirk and Spock finds themselves in the middle of their private war and all they needed was the zenite for Merak II but now the must end the war before they can obtain the much needed zenite. The botanical plague is quickly spreading on Merak II, time is running out.I find an interest in this episode due to class separation (areas they can live), profiteers vs hard-workers and rich vs poor scenario. Another important point is the rich (Plasus) refusing simple health measures - the masks to protect the Troglytes from the gas that is emitted when mining the zenite.8.5/10",8
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cloud Minders (TV Episode 1969)","""Hours can be centuries just as words can be lies"".","Before there was a Cloud City of Bespin in the Star Wars universe, there was the Cloud City of Stratos in the world of Star Trek. I didn't realize that until I saw this episode again after many years. And who knows what writer may have dreamed up the concept even earlier in science fiction writings. But you have to admit, Stratos looked pretty cheesy in those close up views unlike Bespin, which benefited from a decade's worth of improvement in special effects.The episode makes an interesting commentary on class warfare and slavery, just ripe for the socially aware decade of the Sixties. Gene Roddenberry and his writers took a similar stab at racism in a prior Season III story called ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"", the story of mirror image black/white enemies who wage battle aboard the Enterprise. Without knowing a lot about Roddenberry's politics, it also looks like he might have been skewering typical liberal elitism in the episode as well. Though far more pronounced today, it's no secret that liberals in media, education, science and government consider themselves the ordained arbiters of what's best for all the rest of society.In any event, if the Troglytes were meant to represent a malcontent race of inferior cave dwellers, I find it quite amusing that their leader Vanna (Charlene Polite) had the resources to acquire eye shadow. That's one of the inconsistencies you'll find in any number of Star Trek tales, as the characters will often do something that's quite out of character. Then of course, you have something really silly like the rock wall of the underground cave moving when Captain Kirk shoves High Adviser Plasus (Jeff Corey) against it during their scuffle.By this time near the end of the series run, you can see how sloppy writing was beginning to take it's toll. Though you had the germ of a good idea at the center of some stories, they wound up getting frittered away with inconsistencies in the telling. The non-interference Prime Directive took another direct hit here, and Spock continued on his path of expressing non-Vulcan attributes. In a prior episode, ""Requiem For Methuseleh"", Spock was experiencing envy over a da Vinci art collection, while here he's virtually mesmerized by the beauty of the Ardanian Droxine (Diana Ewing). Not very logical, even if it is fascinating.",7
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cloud Minders (TV Episode 1969)",good script marred by execution difficulties and one poor casting,"This show was one of the stronger final season Trek shows on the effects of social stratification on the inhabitants of Ardana. The high priest of Ardana and the planet's elite live in Stratos, their city in the Clouds and do whatever they wish while condemning the lowly Troglydytes to a miserable existence mining the planet's resources below. Kirk and his crew are attacked by the Troglydtes near the beginning of the show and are saved by the leader of Ardana, Plassus.Unlike many boring season 3 offerings, this show had more spark and energy. It was nice to see Droxine, the daughter of the High Priest Plassus state that she would like to see the Troglydtes at the end of the show. While the ending of the conflict--through the use of gas masks--is unconvincing and robs the show of part of its premise and power, Droxine's promise to Spock here was supposed to foreshadow the gradual breakdown in social inequality between the inhabitants of Stratos and the Troglodytes. Hence, the film here follows in the Classic Trek tradition. Another problem is that Diana Ewing is slightly miscast as Droxine; her promise to Spock to investigate the Troglydtes' dire situation seems insincere. Its almost as if she delivers this line just to impress Spock--not because she really cares about them. Droxine's infatuation with Spock and Spock's reference to the 'lovely Droxine' and allusion to the 'pon farr' also shows how far the show was straying from its Classic Trek roots towards the end of season 3. A true Vulcan would not reveal such a thing to Droxine--a woman whom he only barely knows! Plassus, on the other hand, makes a convincing and belligerent leader of Stratos who seems quite sincere when he threatens to drag Kirk to a tribunal for forcibly beaming him down to the caves of Ardana and forcing him to physically dig zenite in order to suffer the effects of its anger inducing gas. Kirk's demand that Plassus ""dig"" in the caves was somewhat petty and totally out of character. The real Kirk would not have uttered such a phrase and instead forced Plassus to negotiate a compromise to resolve the social inequality that the Troglydtes faced on Ardana. I am uncertain if Kirk's intervention in beaming down Plassus to Ardana is a violation of the Prime Directive since the episode never says if Ardana is a member of the Federation and Kirk had only a few hours left to transport the badly needed zenite to stop the plague on Merak II.The 'gas mask' solution totally ignores the whole point of social inequality in this episode. But by now, the producers were running low on fresh new ideas--and production money--and placed an emphasis on resolving episodes with simple but totally unconvincing solutions to such complex social issues. As Plassus said to Kirk, I believe, you cannot solve centuries of social inequality with gas masks. The producer's solution is much too glib and unconvincing to be successful. Unfortunately, this episode is an example of Star Trek's decline in production quality here. David Gerrold's script was good but the producers didn't handle it right unfortunately. I assign it 7 out of 10.",7
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cloud Minders (TV Episode 1969)",Looking Down (Literally) At Others,"In ""The Cloud Minders"", the Enterprise is on an extremely important mission to save the environment of a lush planet whose vegetation has a disease spreading across the entire surface. It is in danger of having its habitat destroyed and soon becoming uninhabitable. Star Fleet has ordered the Enterprise to pick up a shipment of zenite, the mineral cure for the disease, from a federation planet known as Ardana. Ardana is an odd planet with a floating city in the sky where the government subsists. Kirk and Spock beam to the surface to pick up the shipment but are attacked by the miners. They have shown up in the middle of a revolutionary uprising. The miners feel subservient to the residents of the cloud and want equal rights. Until all of this is settled, Kirk must wait for his shipment to save the other planet. He tries to play intermediary but the council of Ardana is not interested in humoring the miners.The cloud citizens look down (figuratively and literally) at the miners and consider them of a lower stock of being. Their IQs are lower and they are less developed. But the crew of the Enterprise run some tests and unearth something big: the zenite in the mines is diminishing the mental capabilities of the miners. There is no difference between the cloud people and the miners besides this. Kirk makes an appeal to both sides with limited success. He finally traps the leaders of both sides in the mines with him to prove the dangerous state of the zenite. He makes his point, gets the shipment he came for, and leaves with the two sides struggling to coexist as equals.This is a bit of a messy episode. It feels as if the writer of this one had a lot of ideas floating around in their mind and tried to jam it all into a condensed 45 minute episode. With a more capable director, this may have worked. But the structure of it all feels disjointed and confusing. There are multiple shots of people ADR-ing their lines without any lips moving, weird cutaway shots that don't match the background, all sorts of weird odds and ends that take me out of the episode. This is partially to blame on the budget but the director clearly didn't help things.The message of this episode clearly pertains to racism in the USA occurring during the airing of this episode (and sadly still today). While a good message, it feels a bit heavy-handed. The ""superiors"" are literally looking down at the ""inferiors"" from their ivory tower. It's all a bit much. The romantic angle with Spock feels shoehorned in as well... An average episode by season 3 standards.",5
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cloud Minders (TV Episode 1969)",Star Trek: The Original Series - The Cloud Miners,"The intellectually high-minded (and I think arrogant, although they would probably disagree) Stratosians live in an anti-gravity Shangri-La, the ""city of the clouds""--a privileged few within this palatial paradise, alluring where all the comforts are realized--while the ""Troglytes"", who work in the terrible conditions of the mines for the precious zenite needed on a planet in biological turmoil (on the verge of extinction if the shipment isn't received in twelve hours) are at odds which causes Kirk complications as the shipment is being held hostage until negotiations for rights are considered. Jeff Corey is Mr. Director Plasus, chief authority of the Stratos city growing impatient with the miners' revolt, isn't thrilled with Kirk when the captain defiantly scolds him for using ""light torture"" (working in the caves causes an aversion to light because of the prevalent darkness) to try and interrogate a member of the Troglytes, Vanna (Charlene Polite) for the information on where the zenite deposits are. Later it is realized by Kirk, Spock, and Bones that zenite ""gas"" causes the miners to become violent and intellectually inferior, mentally and emotionally malfunctioning. Bones lets Kirk know that these effects are only temporary, so the captain sees that as an opportunity to possibly initiate talks between the Stratosians and Troglytes, but Plasus is rather resistant to Kirk's presentation of a protective mask that will diffuse the obvious unrest that exists. Kirk literally must convince Plasus and Vanna that the mask is the answer to bringing the miners evolutionary advantage held against them because of the zenite gas while the people of Stratos must come to terms with the fact that those on the ground below deserve better than what history has given them. The episode does have a message, that being ""bad working conditions for certain folks while those benefiting from the labor enjoy the fruits of their labor"", with Kirk and Spock addressing it with the people of Stratos who fail to see the problem that currently exists. They see the miners as intellectually inferior and violent, while they are entitled to the pleasures that come from hard labor of the Troglytes. When a revolt challenges that status quo, Plasus wants to quell their uprising, while Kirk and Spock try and convince him that they deserve far better than what they currently have. Diana Ewing is Plasus stunning, scantily-clad, soft-spoken and naive daughter, Droxine. Droxine and Spock seem to acknowledge an attraction, but I guess I didn't feel it in regards to chemistryher innocence and naiveté, a product of how she's been raised within the ideology of her culture, is compelling to Spock, but he doesn't agree with how the miners are treated. Kirk and Plasus fighting in the mine while Vanna looks on in concern before a communication to the Enterprise spurns a transport (Kirk wants to convince Plasus that zenite gas exists and that the mask helps to stop its effects) was rather funny to me because Corey being able to actually overpower Shatner was a real stretchand looks so when they combat. Topical episode commenting on how the working class make up many while those reaping the profits of their labor live in affluence and comfortmuch hasn't changed. Droxine's attire is quite revealing and provocative.",5
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cloud Minders (TV Episode 1969)",Interesting 3rd season episode,"Star Trek goes back to form in examining social rifts caused by people dividing themselves and mistaking symptoms for causes of those same social rifts.There's a theory that our current social divides stem back to the abundance of viral life forms that infected those living near the equator and warmer watered regions of the planet, and those that lived in more temperate or colder regions were spared the ravages of constant disease. This episode postulates a material cause for the divisions between social groups, notably the white and black populations of post 1950's US, but can be applied to any region of the world where such schisms are manifest.Towards the end we hear familiar rhetoric of the time, citing the need to resort to civil disorder to address injustices, and the reasons the lower classes must remain in the lower classes; i.e. familiar inaccurate arguments of superior intelligence, lack of ability and so forth. Hence the collision between the two warring factions in the episode. All the while Kirk and crew must address another emergency that is held up by the conflagration. It's an episode that takes Trek back to form of the first two seasons, though again the production values are somewhat spartan, though still very good. It feels like more money was spent on this episode, but only just. There's still a lack of extras that might have added visual weight, and the upgraded effects of the remastered special edition which are now on bluray, replace the old matte paintings and animation.What's interesting about this episode is that not only is the script good, but we see another love interest for Spock, only on a more Vulcan (Vulcanian?) intellectual level than the biologically forced pon farr as per the Amok Time episode a couple seasons before. Spock realizes that beauty can stir his otherwise impassive self, but is curious and disappointed when he discovers something about himself.Another positive is that the plot melds well with the basic story, although there is some plausibility issue with some of the story elements towards the end of the episode.This is one of those episodes where if there had been a lot more money then it could have been turned into a very decent feature film. Imagine throngs of disgruntled troglodytes, thousands of citizen artists living in Stratos, imagine an escape scene from Stratos with Kirk fighting his way, imagine all kinds of things and you'll get a sense that this is really the good skeleton of a good episode hampered by third season budget cuts.Give it a shot.",
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cloud Minders (TV Episode 1969)",Kirk seems to have met his match in strength.....,"This story starts out quite intriguing as the Enterprise, en-voyage to assist a neighboring fleet with diminishing supplies of Zeonite gas (similar to Earth's Oxygen), takes a necessary detour to a nearby planetary civilization well-known for its Zeonite gas-mining corporation: alias, the Troglytes. Upon arrival, Kirk & Spock are seemingly unwelcomed as they wander the grounds, looking for their party, and then are suddenly attacked by the vengeful Troglyte workers, determined to prevent any further Zeonite distribution, in reference to their ongoing slave-trade stand-off against the Collosal.Kirk is faced-off with a certain female Troglyte: Vanna; the co-leader. And finally appears to have met his match in strength. Their combat struggle is most interesting, as neither appear to gain the upper-hand during what I consider one of the few most interesting fight scenes - especially with a female combatant. Later, Kirk & Spock meet the planetary Commissioners, including the princess daughter - whom Spock takes a sincere (and fully human) romantic interest in, while Vanna; the female Troglyte, encounters Kirk. Again, in the twill and rumble of what would normally be a typical moment of Kirk-passion, we have yet another female enemy not succumbed under his powers of love and seduction. That's particularly what most intrigued me about this episode. Although sadly, the actress, and character she plays, are one-time-only - this episode plays out just enough love-hate/ sexual tension to satisfy most any Trek fan.I was most intrigued by Kirk's change in testosterate attitude, when facing against Vanna. Her character is so tense, stubborn, strong-willed, and yet undeniably feminine, and yet - she does not simply give-in to Kirk's usually romancing, seductive charms.",10
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cloud Minders (TV Episode 1969)",Medium quality episode with more embarrassing Spock romance,"I found this episode to have a medium quality: nothing incredibly engaging but also very little that was painful to watch. Kirk and Spock arrive at a planet to pick up some much-needed supplies for a distant suffering planet and find themselves embroiled in class warfare. The class warfare theme has been done better a hundred times by other shows and books, so there was little new to chew on in terms of the plot. The dialogue and acting was still interesting enough to keep the show moving despite the ho-hum plot.With that said, I did find the the Spock's romance painful to watch and disloyal to the show's roots. Spock is logical and unemotional. He is not supposed to fall in love with the first girl on a planet that he trips over the way Kirk tends to. And I know that girl was supposed to be attractive and eye-candy for the viewers, but she looked uncomfortably anorexic to me. All I could think of during her scenes was ""that poor anorexic girl is forced to bare her limbs and ribs for a couple of dollars in Hollywood.In the end, solving the planet's class inequality problems with gas masks seemed like an easy out for lazy writers.",5

Those buggers in the sky talk with incredible disdain. What they don't realize is that the two peoples came from the same DNA. The poor miners have been unable to evolve because the substance they mine has a detrimental effect on their brains. Kirk, who of course is drawn to the female of the bare shoulders again, decides that something is wrong and tries to bring the two sides together.

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it.

Mind you, it's a bit too close to an old ""Outer Limits"" episode called ""Fun & Games"", but Trek's version is, arguably, the better of the two.While searching for signs of life on an unexplored planet, the Enterprise is visited by Abraham Lincoln. Yes, that's President Abraham Lincoln, but it doesn't come off as silly as it sounds. In this story, a mysterious alien race creates a living breathing Honest Abe (a boyhood hero to Kirk) who issues an invitation to Kirk and Spock to beam down with him to the planet surface. Upon their arrival they encounter other historical figures: Genghis Khan; Kayless, the ruthless Klingon warlord; genocidal war criminal, Colonel Green; Zora, a sort of alien Dr. Mengela; and for Spock's titillation, Surak, the intellectual father of the Vulcan race. Next enters one of ""Star Trek's"" wildest creations, a hulking alien made of volcanic rock. With it's multiple eyes flashing in rhythm with it's strange, tremulous voice, the creature informs Kirk and Spock that they are to be part of an experiment. An observed conflict in which they will oppose Col. Green and his associates to prove whether good or evil is the stronger philosophy. When Kirk informs their host that he and Spock refuse to participate, the alien coolly assures him, ""you will decide otherwise."" Suddenly the Enterprise's engines begin to overload, and Kirk is given a cause to fight for: defeat ""Team Evil"" or his ship and crew will be destroyed. ""Star Trek"" may be an ancient, low budget sci-fi series, but the show's attention to character development really wins out over it's age and dated effects. Lee Bergere's performance in particular is one the most effective portrayals of Abraham Lincoln ever put on film. Noble and wise with a gentle wit, his Lincoln works beautifully as a character in this story of men who are forced into a conflict they want no part of. Credit is due the writers for striving to capture the kind of inner turmoil Lincoln must have experienced as president during the civil war and drawing on that to enhance the story. Example: he tells Kirk in one scene, ""There is no gentle way to kill. No honourable way to destroy. There is nothing good in war except it's ending, and you're fighting for the lives of your crew."" Excellently written, and believably delivered by Bergere. Barry Atwater, who plays the Vulcan pacifist, Surak, deserves a nod as well. Not all actors wearing those pointed ears have been able to perform to the same standard that Leonard Nimoy set for playing a Vulcan, but Atwater is one actor who rose to the challenge admirably. His character's own moral conflict over the question of whether or not to fight also adds emotional depth to the story, as well as to this interesting, memorable character. A few gripes about ""Savage Curtain"", (besides the fact that two of the ""Team evil"" characters don't have a single line of dialog): -The occasional low rent aspects of the fight sequences. For example, the throwing around of rubbery looking rocks hurts the realism of the battle scenes. Also, the sound of their spears in flight would have been much more effective had the audio department added some better sound effects. -Herschel Daughterty proves he's no master action director with a protracted, embarrassingly clumsy-looking shot of Mr. Spock grappling with a woman.-When one character is taken prisoner, the director settled for the most half-hearted cries of distress ever heard. In fact, as kids, to crack ourselves up we would imitate these sad cries around the house. If you see my brother just say in a flat, disinterested tone, ""help me, Spock"". He'll know what you're referring to. But those flaws aside, ""Savage Curtain"" is really a triumph thanks in large part to the richness of the characters as well as the quality of the performances. There are some genuinely compelling dramatic moments here, and this is what ""Star Trek"" did so well that other sci-fi shows of the day generally couldn't match. Sure, it wanted to be exciting and entertaining, but it also strove to be thoughtful and moving as well.",

The better scenes, however, are not the later action sequences, but when Abraham Lincoln beams aboard the ship and gets acquainted with Kirk and the crew. It's an excellent guest appearance by actor Bergere, who is given some entertaining dialog, mirrored later by actor Atwater, who plays the famous Vulcan, Surak. The crew reactions to such famous personages and their debates about the nature of these obvious aliens-in-disguise is what elevates this above the average 3rd season episode. Doohan, as Scotty, steals a couple of scenes here, as usual.In the last two-thirds of the episode, Kirk & Spock, along with Lincoln, beam down to the planet, meet Surak, and then are forced to confront four other famous, er, infamous figures from the past: Colonel Green, Kahless the Unforgettable, Zora (who?) and Genghis Khan. Col.Green made his name in some genocidal war in the 21st century (probably related to the 3rd World War brought up in later Trek series). Kahless, of course, is the famous/infamous Klingon, reinterpreted on the TNG series. The plot, at this point, is fairly simple: with no advanced weapons, using whatever resources are on hand in the primitive setting, such as spears, the two quartets must fight it out until one side is the victor. It's very basic, very primal, with our heroes and villains reduced to chess pieces on the cosmic board of some higher powers. There are no astonishing revelations towards the end, with Kirk & Spock merely showing that their Starfleet training can be put to use, if required. Even so, it seemed to me they were lucky in the end - that Green miscalculated and didn't press on to victory when he had the chance, due to, I suppose, cowardice. This episode also showed, again, the ingenuity necessary to come up with unusual-looking aliens when you have almost no budget for special make-up and FX.",7
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Savage Curtain (TV Episode 1969)",Slightly cartoonish but interesting show,"This was an interesting show that could have been handled better. Really, did we have to see Abraham Lincoln appear in this episode on the side of 'good' only to see him later killed! Talk about history repeating itself--or a predictable ending. The producers could have chosen better scripts like the forthcoming 'All Our Yesterdays', and that episode would have been much more believable. Instead we got this somewhat cartoonish episode. Who couldn't guess that Spock, Kirk, the Vulcan philosopher Surak and Abraham Lincoln would team up against the evil Colonel Green, Zora, the Klingon Kahless, and Genghis Khan under the watchful eye of the Excalbians? But at least the Excalbians have a reason for the contest: they are curious to see which side would triumph if good was pitted against evil...even if they are willing to destroy the Enterprise in order to compel Kirk to carry out his part in their contest.There is no moral tale here except the now generic story line that good will triumph over evil. I'm afraid by its 77th episode, Star Trek was on its last legs and the many prior poor outings of season 3 only emphasise this point. However, my gripes aside, this episode was a decent show: both Lee Bergere and Barry Atwater were perfectly cast as Lincoln and Surak and they together elevate this episode to slightly above average in my view. The classic scene of this show occurs onboard the bridge of the Enterprise, when Lincoln absentmindedly calls Uhura a negress due to her race and then apologizes for his comments and says to her that they were made without malice. Uhura's reply--that she wasn't offended by the term because in her time (the 23rd century) we've learned not to fear words--was Classic Trek at its very best. While this one scene does not redeem an entire episode, it was nice to see Kirk and Spock plan different military strategies against their infamous enemies. Surak himself was very sharp and direct as a Vulcan: he immediatedly detects emotion emanating from Spock when the latter first sees him--and chides Spock for it since Vulcans were supposed to have evolved emotion out of their psyches. However, he gently forgives Spock saying that given the circumstances of their meeting--on an alien planet--Spock's reaction was understandable. That was a very classy touch. It shows that some of the TOS producers still knew what made Star Trek work. I wish we got to see more of Surak. The strange thing about season 3 of Star Trek TOS is how it rebounded in quality for its final 3 episodes after the string of subpar shows which were produced after The Tholian Web especially The Way to Eden, That Which Survives and The Lights of Zetar. The Savage Curtain was eminently watchable compared to many other season 3 shows. A rating of 7 out of 10 is not at all unreasonable.",7
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Savage Curtain (TV Episode 1969)","""Don't let prejudice and rumor sway you"".","I kind of liked the way this one started out with Abraham Lincoln beaming aboard the Enterprise, but as has happened before, an interesting concept is never fully developed and brought to a meaningful conclusion. Apparently Lincoln (Lee Bergere) was a boyhood hero to Captain Kirk, while everyone on the planet Vulcan revered the legendary Surak (Barry Atwater). The two heroes are teamed up with Kirk and Spock to do physical battle with the galaxy's most notorious outlaws, with a mute Genghis Khan representing ancient Earth history. This, all in the name of defining good versus evil, life versus death for what I'll describe as a smoking volcanic rock for lack of a better term. In tone and appearance, this episode of Trek could have been rolled out as a special edition of 'Lost in Space'.At least Honest Abe was given some intriguing situations and dialog. In particular, I was impressed with his analysis of how to battle the enemy - ""We fight on their level. With treachery, brutality, finality. We match their evil"". Now there's some advice the world could take today in going up against the likes of Achmadinejad, Kim Jong Il, and Al-Qaddafi instead of futile attempts at negotiation with no pre-conditions.However just like some of the prior episodes winding down Season III, this one closed out with some lazy writing that didn't achieve a satisfying ending. With a hands down advantage of four against two at the finale, the bad guys simply run off when Kirk and Spock press an attack. Really? Kahless the Unforgettable and Colonel Green simply run away? Genghis Khan? Come on. These guys wouldn't have stopped if they had to fight alone based on their reputations, and here they decide to call it a day. It just didn't make much sense to me given their ruthlessness and ferocity. Which is probably why Dr. McCoy's early comment continued to ring in my mind as I watched the story - ""There's no intelligent life here"".",7
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Savage Curtain (TV Episode 1969)","As mirror of its era, TREK's most anguished episode ?","I've always enjoyed this solid 3rd seasoner from the gitgo, for various favorable points reviewers here note. The bravura performance by Lee Bergere as Abe Lincoln makes this episode memorable by itself. Seeing it again recently after some few years I was struck anew. All the way back to first season, other episodes (Corbomite Maneuver, Arena etc) have featured Kirk and crew forced into confrontations staged by superior aliens. But ""Savage Curtain"" stands out among them for its unusual down beat ending theme of futility and frustration, redeemed by resolve to overcome. Equivalent scenarios in other episodes mostly ended with promising outlooks (Arena) even open invitations after winning over alien hearts and minds (Specter of the Gun, Corbomite) - the beginnings of what could be beautiful friendships. The closing perspective in Savage Curtain is sadder but wiser, and far more solemn - uniquely for this ST subgenre. After testing the humans and their moral concepts without satisfactory result, the unimpressed alien dismissively releases Kirk and Spock, letting them go back to their ship. But its one of Kirk's lines that tips off the subtext for me -about how hard it was for him to see Abraham Lincoln die ""again; I feel like now I understand what the nation must have gone through back then."" The context of the times in which the show first ran, with what the country was going through in months preceding this show, especially the assassinations of RFK and Martin Luther King - echoed between the words loud and clear, even though I never caught it previously. As an icon of civil rights, and a US president assassinated as well - the Lincoln character evokes by association, both MLK and JFK in a single stroke. This episode's finale sounds a dramatic note as if consolatory, of grief understood and shared by the show's creators with its audience - at the time reeling alike, under the traumatic impact of violent, historic political tragedies in the news. This aspect reaches its peak when, after the seemingly dismal failure of an alien encounter so harrowing, amid bloodshed with nothing gained - Kirk reflects on the heroic inspiration of figures such as Saruk and Lincoln: ""So much of their work remains to be done."" In this one episode TREK offers the exception to its own rule, deviating from its usual idealism, whether in tragedy or comedy - by an unrelenting realism of urgent perspective. From pop music of the era, Dion's 'Abraham, Martin and John"" offers an ideal comparison for this episode in terms of themes and context. The song ministers to mass grief in the wake of real life events its lyrics reference literally - which 'Savage Curtain' alludes to figuratively, by scifi allegory (a fave among good ol' TREK's many tricks). So I rate this one a uniquely good voyage from the hallowed cellars of 1960s TREK - 'the real thing' (not the pepsi generation). Its like fine wine - some stuff only gets better with age.",8
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Savage Curtain (TV Episode 1969)",Star Trek: The Original Series - The Savage Curtain,"I admit that I have a deep fondness for ""The Savage Curtain"" if just because I simply love the improbable idea of a stunning recreation of Abraham Lincoln and ""father of Vulcan civilization/peace/logic"", Surak from the minds of Kirk and Spock (it is established how much admiration and respect Kirk and Spock have for these historical figures) forced into combat with evil historical figures representing the worst kind of lot as rock beings on a planet primarily of lava want to study ""good vs. evil"" and judge the results. Lee Bergere as Honest Abe is a treasuremaybe this is the way we want to see him, and for good reason. That wisdom, politeness, brevity, earthy charm, and command of speech, addressing Kirk and crew with the utmost respect, and with that, in return, the likes of Bones and Scotty are a bit concerned that this is a ruse to get Kirk and Spock to the planet. While Abe ultimately is not to blame, the ""chief rock creature"", its voice laying out the battle (""spectacle"" it calls this), does place Kirk and Spock in danger of possible demise if the ""good doesn't overcome the evil"". Oh, and (of course) the Enterprise will perish if Kirk, Spock, Abe, and Surak fail. Barry Atwater, as the peace-minded Vulcan, gives us a possible insight into just why Spock's people were able to overcome their violence and primitive behavior. Kirk tries to convince Surak that attempts at negotiating peace with genocidal sociopath (always looking for a benefit to himself above all others), Colonel Green (Phillip Pine), the early incarnation of cutthroat and insidious Klingon Kahless (Bob Herron), and brutish Genghis Khan (Nathan Jung) and Zora (Carol Daniels), who don't speak just attack. Surak's tragic fate explains just what Kirk and Spock are up against. Abe's fate, despite such bravery as he attempts to rescue Surak while Kirk and Spock go on the offensive, is a real drag because he is so charming and well spoken. You see the pangs of this battle on the faces of Kirk and Spock who actually react in devastation at the fates of Abe and Surak as if they were more than just well done elaborate replicas of the real people. The rock creature is rather laughable, rubbery costume with light bulb eyes that go on and off when it talks. The battle itself might have us recalling ""Arena"" a bit. Abe Lincoln onboard the Enterprise is a real treat! His conversation with Uhura on the Bridge is quite an important scene, explaining racial change in the future; sci-fi according to Roddenbery was the right platform for such a moment. Spock getting to meet Surak, even if an imitation, was splendidSpock's immediate reaction of astonishment is a cool moment. Scotty flabbergasted at having to get all dignified for Imitation Abe is hilarious, but Kirk's high degree of admiration for him just seemed appropriate. Pine makes the most of his time in the episode as a clever schemer, with an initiative that drives him to use whatever tactics he can to gain advantage ans survive. The Kahless of this episode is quite different than how he's portrayed by Worf on The Next Generation.",8
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Savage Curtain (TV Episode 1969)",The Evolving Abe,"Gene Roddenberry's stories tended to reflect his social views, and ""Star Trek's"" sci-fi dramas were frequently metaphors for social and historical issues. The 3rd season's ""The Savage Curtain"" was Roddenberry's take on President Lincoln and the American Civil War. Specifically, Roddenberry explores the ethics of the leadership provided by Lincoln and weighs in against those who bemoan Lincoln's willingness to adapt expedient but extra legal tactics against his opponent.In the episode Roddenberry nicely illustrates this by using two Lincoln's. Surak is the newly elected Lincoln, a President significantly more moderate and conciliatory than most of his party. Someone who arrived in Washington fully convinced that the union could be preserved peacefully.And during his first couple months in office many Unionists began to question whether they had put the right man in the White House for the unprecedented crisis faced by the country. They feared he lacked iron and would be unable to rise to the occasion.Colonel Green appears to be a blend of John Floyd (Buchanan's outgoing Secretary of War) and Brigadier David Twiggs (Army commander of Texas); who had specialized in especially deceptive (and unnecessary) acts of treason following Lincoln's election. Aggressively abusing their positions of trust and violating their oaths of office; all in the service of gaining a short-term advantage. From the devious actions of opponents like these Lincoln learned that pro-Union people would be increasingly vulnerable should they expect the old rules to still apply.As occurred in history, the Surak Lincoln is only briefly a part of the equation. Replaced by the Lincoln who when finally compelled by events to accept the gravity of the situation, worked extra-legally to prevent the secession of Maryland and Missouri. In the episode this Lincoln states: ""We fight on their level with trickery, brutality, and finality"".In the end the creature poses the same question often posed by students of the American Civil War: if good and evil use the same methods toward the achievement of the same results, what is the difference between them? Of course, Roddenberry has already answered it; Kirk is fighting for the lives of his crew and in a bigger sense his mission of advancing civilization. His opponent is fighting for the rewards of power, fighting to gain an advantage over others.Kirk and Spock's final confrontation with the evil forces is deliberately listless; representing secession as the retreat of evil when forcibly confronted. As in 1865, evil retreats to preserve itself - knowing there will be less direct ways to protect its advantaged status.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Savage Curtain (TV Episode 1969)",Lincoln in Space,"In ""The Savage Curtain"", whilst scanning an uninhabited planet with a molten rock surface, the Enterprise receives an unexpected visitor: former president Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln beckons Kirk and Spock to the planet's surface where they also run into the father of modern-Vulcanism Surak. A strange rock creature pits these four against a group of history's most evil beings as an experiment of which is better: good or evil. The foursome battle Ghengis Khan, the father of modern-Klingonism Kahless, a mad scientist named Zora, and an earthling named Col. Green who was responsible for a mid-21st century genocide.The fate of the Enterprise is at stake so Kirk and Spock agree to fight. Surak goes the way of peace and is promptly killed. Lincoln tries a sneaky rescue and perishes as well. These two beings were created by the rock people to assist Kirk but always thought of themselves as the real icons. (This is never fully explained). Kirk and Spock fight off the 4 evil-doers, proving once and for all (for the zenith time) that good triumphs evil. But apparently it must always resort to violence? The Enterprise was being held captive the entire time but is now allowed to leave...How am I not supposed to laugh when Abe Lincoln shows up on the deck of the Enterprise hundreds of years after his death? My brain shut off from the word go during this one. The plot is some bizarrely out there and yet, at the same time, so bland. Its ground we've tread a bunch of times before during TOS's run and it's been done much better in the past. Lots of people claim that the show had run out of ideas by the end of its third season; a lot of ideas were recycled. Yet season 3 still has some really solid episodes, even with the financial constraints. Maybe the writers had just gotten lazy and their quality of work went down. There was still obviously room for more ideas (how much spinoffs of Star Trek have we had since then?) so I'm not convinced that that's the answer. But maybe 3 seasons of the 1960's version was about all American could handle at the time.",4
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Savage Curtain (TV Episode 1969)",Kirk and Spock fight evil alongside Abraham Lincoln,"As the Enterprise passes a volcanic planet a message is received from a being claimed to be none other than Abraham Lincoln yes that Abraham Lincoln! Despite knowing it can't be him Kirk allows him to beam aboard and affords him the full honours due to the man he claims to be. After a tour of the ship he invites Kirk and Spock to beam down to the planet where he promises Spock will meet a great Vulcan. Despite warnings from Scotty and McCoy that they might be beaming down into lava they go ahead although their phasers left on the transporter pad. On the surface they do indeed meet the great Vulcan Surak. Shortly afterwards a 'rock monster' appears and tell them that the four of them, designated 'good' are to fight four 'Evil' characters that include Genghis Khan and the Klingon Kahless. This is because the creature wants to learn about good and evil as it has no understanding of the concepts. At first they refuse to fight but then the rock-monsters says that if they don't the Enterprise will be destroyed.It is clear by now that the series is now running out of steam; we've already had episodes where aliens want to understand the way humans think so force a fight to the death. Having historical figures appear is a little too cheesy even if they aren't actually the people they appear to be. This also provides a bit of a plot hole; if the aliens can replicate good and evil characters from history why do they need to threaten some actual people? The fight scenes were little more than characters throwing pointy sticks and fake rocks; there was nowhere near the tension of the episode where Kirk fought lizard-man Gorn. Overall a bit of a disappointment as Star Trek had done it all before and done it better.",6
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Savage Curtain (TV Episode 1969)",Truly Awful and Stupid,"If this is ""true Star Trek"" then Star Trek is nothing but a bunch of fanciful fantasy buffoonery.

Then they all beam down to a volcanic planet and go through another arena experience as heroes versus famous evil folks duke it out with sticks and stones, a fight hosted by .. eh, I don't remember .. oh that's right, a ROCK MONSTER, one that dances a little when fighting commences. The ending had NO MORAL, of course Kirk and his closest cronies survive because the series must go on so this is no spoiler, but really I didn't pick up that anything really happened. The aliens responsible for this didn't learn anything about human philosophy, and Kirk and the crew didn't grow from the experience either. Just a total waste of time.I'm utterly shocked and confused that ""Spock's Brain"" is so frequently referenced as the worst TOS episode yet this one isn't. I'm going through the whole series and this one takes the cake. There's no sci-fi, no interesting dialog, no lessons, it's like a stupid bad dream, as if the writers sat down cobbled together the most formulaic Star Trek ideas (hallucinations, arena fighting) and slapped it into a script without any intention to produce anything interesting except only to ogle the history of Abraham Lincoln's presumed personality. This is beyond meaninglessly stupid and a waste of time.",2

Try to find a moving or memorable chapter of Mannix, Ironside, Mod Squad...all successful shows, but ""out the door"" once watched. Trek is on a 50 year roll for a reason. Kirk has to remind Scott & McCoy of the very reason for the star-ship existence; after all, it's dangerous just being in space. And yes, they have been offered contact. There is much praise for Lincoln's portrayal, but I think Col. Green steals the show. The smug look when he's introduced as the leader of a genocidal war, Kirk's suspicious, guarded dialogue, ""Where are you from?"", his hostile chat with Surak, bossing the other three around...he's one of ST's many actors handed a one-time role and truly ""owning it"". Surak's role is strong too, ""Maybe it's our belief in peace that's being tested"". Tough stuff. When he wins, Kirk fires, ""What gives you the right?""...Yarnak explains that they have a need to know; just because they're immobile, it doesn't mean that they're not curious or intelligent; different from Earthlings, but with similar needs. And because they're incapable of space travel, experience must come to them. An altogether brilliant entry.",10

The themes of good versus evil and violence versus peace come off as stale and old news. Worse still, instead of winning in some clever way, or resisting violence when they have the upper hand, Kirk and Spock get out of this mess by simply winning a wrestling match. The only novel item in this entire episode is the one thing that most spells its doom: Abraham Lincoln on an alien planet. There is no real reason given for his appearance, even by the end when the credits are rolling.

He is given full Presidential honors, despite the crew's complaints. The treatment of the President as a liberator of the slaves is mildly heavy handed when he beams aboard and meets Uhura, referring to her as a ""Negress"".

If you don't snicker at Lincoln crawling on all fours, trying to sneak up on the enemy, with his derriere facing the viewers, then you are taking this show far too seriously. If you think President Lincoln looks good throwing stones on a cheap 60s film set, then you've been watching ""Star Trek"" far too long and often.This mesmerizing, thought-provoking piece of 60s cheese offers the exciting possibility that Lincoln wasn't assassinated in a 19th-century theater, but on a distant planet under an orange sky, in the 25th century, Starlog 23546736. (You historians out there should seriously contemplate this new theory before shooting it down like the intellectual snobs that all of you are.)This is yet another ST episode that serves to show just why the Vulkan culture is so vastly inferior to Earth's: their ""greatest ever Vulkan"", Surak, is a Gandhi-like pacifistic peacenik who falls into a Warfare 101 trap as if the lava planet hands out free lobotomies on a daily basis. I've seen teenage bunnies who sniff out a trap with more ease. Besides, I never understood the ""logic"" of Vulkans being unemotional (or trying to be) and yet so unwilling to harm even a blood-sucking mosquito. That's a contradiction right there. If Roddenberry wanted to have an alien race of peace-treaty-obsessed, noble, cowardly losers on the show, then he should have made them as animated as Robin Williams in a weeper drama; Vulkans should be behaving like menopausal middle-aged Hausfraus, spilling melodrama left and right, sobbing at the drop of a hat, instead of being the robots they are. What exactly is logical/rational about preserving every single life form in the universe at all cost? But that's Hollywood for ya... either they're trying to sell you Marxism, pacifism, or veganism. They never seem to tire of that crap.The logic of this episode is just as flawed as that of the ""superior"", white-flag-waving Vulkans. Firstly, there is the very silly premise of an ""intelligent"" being that wants to find out the difference between good and evil by having a couple of morons throw rocks at each other. Couldn't he just given them a basketball court and a ball? Later, when the goodies beat the baddies, the rock-creature is so daft that he concludes that ""there is no difference in how good and evil behave"": he concludes this in spite of 23 desperate/futile UN-like attempts at a peaceful resolution, all initiated by the two confused left-wing Vulkans.Why would this lava creature conduct an experiment by using a combination of illusions and real people? Either use only real people or only illusions, in which case you wouldn't even need to harass Kirk and Spock in the first place. Surely, this piece of comical, flowing, ""superior"" rock should be intelligent enough to realize that he's mixing apple and oranges, hence is conducting an experiment like an F-grade 3rd-grader. Besides, if he wanted real evil, he should have included Stalin, Hitler, Sean Penn and Barbra Streisand; Kirk and his pointy-eared hippie friend would have faced far more menace that way.We also have a mute Genghis Khan; he never utters a word. Doesn't planet Orange Lava offer any quick ESL courses to mirages? And why is Genghis the tallest person there? Oh, well, at least he wasn't played by John Wayne again...Very similar to the season 1 episode ""Arena"". Basically a rip-off.",

The Savage Curtain is a memorable episode. Not great but not bad. Shanter will be know as one of the best B actors, and shines again. Shanter's charisma, and stage presents shines with b material.

21,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Savage Curtain (TV Episode 1969)",appropriate honors to each..,"Star TrekA cultural hub and by far one of the most loved and respected tale, Star Trek is created by Gene Roddenberry who wrote this brilliant concept, ahead of its time and is probably why it still doesn't fail to entertain us after these many years. It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. The series didn't seem to mature as it should have but definitely has improved on terms of implementing smarter approach, parallel plot lines and thought provoking concept.Season 03Contrary to expectations, second season failed to project the essential character development which would have give a perfect arc to the series and instead focused on different cases. In this final season the expectations are still higher as they have somehow glued their audience with their gripping screenplay and innovative imagination that doesn't flinch on pushing the boundaries.The Savage CurtainThe writing is dull and exhausting as it doesn't offer much on terms of originality and walks on a crooked path in which it fumbles a lot addition to that the physical sequence too doesn't come off as anticipated which shows weakness on execution.",

0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" All Our Yesterdays (TV Episode 1969)",a very good episode of season 3,"The penultimate episode of Star Trek's third season is excellent and a highlight of the much maligned final season. Essentially, Spock, McCoy and Kirk beam down to Sarpeidon to find the planet's population completely missing except for the presence of a giant library and Mr. Atoz, the librarian. All 3 Trek characters soon accidentally walk into a time travel machine into different periods of Sarpeidon's past. Spock gives a convincing performance as an Ice Age Vulcan who falls in love for Zarabeth while Kirk reprises his unhappy experience with time travel--see the 'City on the Edge of Forever'--when he is accused of witchcraft and jailed before escaping and finding the doorway back in time to Sarpeidon's present. In the end, all 3 Trek characters are saved mere minutes before the Beta Niobe star around Sarpeidon goes supernova. The Enterprise warps away just as the star explodes.Ironically, as William Shatner notes in his book ""Star Trek Memories,"" this show was the source of some dispute since Leonard Nimoy noticed that no reason was given in Lisette's script for the reason why Spock was behaving in such an emotional way. Nimoy relayed his misgivings here directly to the show's executive producer, Fred Freiberger, that Vulcans weren't supposed to fall in love. (p.272) However, Freiberger reasoned, the ice age setting allowed Spock to experience emotions since this was a time when Vulcans still had not evolved into their completely logical present state. This was a great example of improvisation on Freiberger's part to save a script which was far above average for this particular episode. While Shatner notes that the decline in script quality for the third season hurt Spock artistically since his character was forced to bray like a donkey in ""Plato's Stepchildren,"" play music with Hippies in ""the Way to Eden"" or sometimes display emotion, the script here was more believable. Spock's acting here was excellent as Freiberger candidly admitted to Shatner. (p.272) The only obvious plot hole is the fact that since both Spock and McCoy travelled thousands of years back in time, McCoy too should have reverted to a more primitive human state, not just Spock. But this is a forgivable error considering the poor quality of many other season 3 shows, the brilliant Spock/McCoy performance and the originality of this script. Who could have imagined that the present inhabitants of Sarpeidon would escape their doomed planet's fate by travelling into their past? This is certainly what we came to expect from the best of 'Classic Trek'--a genuinely inspired story. Shatner, in 'Memories', named some of his best ""unusual and high quality shows"" of season 3 as The Enterprise Incident, Day of the Dove, Is there in Truth no Beauty, The Tholian Web, And the children Shall Lead and The Paradise Syndrome. (p.273) While my personal opinion is that 'And the children Shall Lead' is a very poor episode while 'Is there in Truth no Beauty' is problematic, ""All Our Yesterdays"" certainly belongs on the list of top season three Star Trek TOS films. I give a 9 out of 10 for 'All Our Yesterdays.'",9
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" All Our Yesterdays (TV Episode 1969)",Trapped in the Past of Another Planet's History,"An unusual take on time travel: instead of traveling to Earth's past, the main trio get stuck in the past history of another planet. They beam down to this planet, whose sun is scheduled to go nova in 3 or 4 hours (that's cutting it close!). In some kind of futuristic library, they meet Mr. Atoz (A to Z, get it? ha-ha) and his duplicates. It turns out, instead of escaping their planet's destruction via space travel, the usual way, the inhabitants have all escaped into their planet's various past time eras. Mr. Atoz uses a time machine to send people on their way after they make a selection (check out the discs we see here, another Trek prognostication of CDs and DVDs!). When Mr. Atoz prepares the machine (the Atavachron-what-sis), gallant Kirk hears a woman's scream and runs into the planet's version of Earth's 17th century, where he gets into a sword fight and is arrested for witchery. There's an eccentric but good performance here by the actress playing a female of ill repute in this time, using phrasing of the time (""...you're a bully fine coo.. Witch! Witch! They'll burn ye...!""). Spock & McCoy follow Kirk, but end up in an ice age, 5000 years earlier.Kirk manages to get back to the library first. The real story here is Spock's reversion to the barbaric tendencies of his ancestors, the warlike Vulcans of 5000 years ago. This doesn't really make sense, except that maybe this time machine is responsible for the change (even so, Spock & McCoy weren't 'prepared' by Atoz - oh, well; it also seems to me Spock was affected by the transition almost immediately - he mentions being from 'millions of light years' away, instead of the correct hundreds or thousands - a gross error for a logical Vulcan). In any case, Spock really shows his nasty side here - forget ""Day of the Dove"" and remember ""This Side of Paradise"" - McCoy quickly finds out that his Vulcan buddy will not stand for any of his usual baiting and nearly gets his face rearranged. Spock also gets it on with Zarabeth, a comely female who had been exiled to this cold past as punishment (a couple of Trek novels were written about Spock's son, the result of this union). All these scenes are eye-openers, a reminder of just how much Spock conceals or holds in. It's also ironic that, only a few episodes earlier (""Requiem for Methuselah""), McCoy was pointing out to Spock how he would never know the pain of love - and now all this happens. Kirk, meanwhile, tussles with the elderly Atoz, who insists that Kirk head back to some past era (""You are evidently a suicidal maniac"" - great stuff from actor Wolfe, last seen in ""Bread and Circuses""). It all works out in the end, but, like I mentioned earlier, they cut it very close. A neat little Trek adventure, with a definite cosmic slant.",7
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" All Our Yesterdays (TV Episode 1969)",definitely one of the very best,"This is certainly one of my all time fav episodes of Trek. There is just so much going on in this one film that its crazy cool. First the guys beam down to an alien planet thats about to explode. They meet a freaky librarian type dude (very well played). Then Kirk manages to get himself transported back to what is very much like 16th century earth. McCoy and Spock try to follow but instead nearly freeze to death on the frozen version of the alien world 100,000 years in the past. Kirk manages to get himself locked up and charged with witchcraft while Spock enjoys some amok time with a sexy cavegirl who was vanquished to the this frozen, awful world by some bad guy.Spock decides hes happy where hes at and gives McCoy a royal assestment whuppin' when the doc suggests they need to look for a way out. Anyhow,they all finally escape, leaving the poor cavegirl behind. It takes a ton of convincing before Spock finally gives in and leaves. You can literally taste the sadness at the end. Leaving the cavegirl all alone in her frozen wasteland just seems cruel and is really touching. Spock must have been out of his vulkin' mind to leave behind his greatest hope for love and being human. Albeit, in a not so nice neighborhood!Anyway, you just get so much bang for your buck with this episode....A love story, the Salem witch trials, Spock as a human, the desperation of being left in total isolation...abandoned, and three entirely different settings on the alien planet. Its amazing they managed to jam all this into one fifty minute film. This one is a classic, don't miss it....I want it on DVD fer shure vulcans!!!!!!",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" All Our Yesterdays (TV Episode 1969)",Brilliant episode from final season one of the show's best,"There's something compelling and strangely believable about this episode. From the very beginning, an atmosphere of tension is created by the knowledge that a certain planet is going to explode within a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy have beamed down to evacuate the inhabitants, all of whom seem to have left already for parts unknown, except for an elderly librarian.The librarian's polite but cryptic advice about where all the citizens have gone to is interrupted by a crisis in which all three Enterprise crew members find themselves unexpectedly hurled into different eras of the planet's past. Kirk finds himself in a time period resembling 17th Century England, while Spock and McCoy are stranded in a desolate, frozen waste. The intercutting between the two stories, and the different hazardous situations the men find themselves in is superbly handled, with return to the present an unknown chance, while the minutes are counting down to the planet's explosion. Imaginative writing and fine acting characterize this episode, with a touching performance by Mariette Hartley as a woman exiled to the Ice Age, and Ian Wolfe as the urbane Librarian. Somewhat reminiscent of the classic episode City On The Edge of Forever, this time travel story is a rich and compelling finale to the series, which concluded one episode later. This has to be one of the best of the whole series, especially remarkable given the generally lesser quality of the third season overall.",10
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" All Our Yesterdays (TV Episode 1969)","Despite being one of the last episodes, it's exceptional and compelling","Kirk and crew land on a lonely planet where the sun is about to explode. They intend to evacuate the inhabitants but find the place deserted except for a Mr. Atoz who operates some sort of high-tech library. Despite trying to get a straight answer from him about everyone's whereabouts, Atoz is indifferent to their questions and insist they must quickly 'make a selection while there is still time'. They have no idea what he's talking about but wander about looking at the hand mirror-like disks on the viewers and they see images of the planet's past. Then, while a disk is in the viewer, Kirk runs through the doorway and is magically transported back in time to what on Earth would look like the time of Louis XIV (the 1660s). When McCoy and Spock follow, a different disk is in the viewer and they are sent to an ice age hell. All too late they realize that the library is a time travel machine and repository.While Kirk's visit is pretty short and not all that exciting, Spock and McCoy's is much more eventful, as Spock falls head over heels for Mariette Hartley--who was sent to this awful place as a punishment. The scenes with Spock are exceptionally interesting and very atypical of the normally logical guy.Spock's departure from the norm, the wildly inventive script and very diverse locales make this an exceptional episode--one well worth seeing.FYI--Ian Wolfe, the excellent character actor, played Mr. Atoz. I am a huge fan of older films and have seen him as a supporting and bit player in countless films in the 30s and 40s and he looked almost exactly like he did in this episode from 1969. Interestingly enough, despite looking ancient, he lived on another 23 years--dying at over 95 years of age!!",9

When a star is about to nova, the big three arrive on the planet, hoping to help evacuate the population. They beam down to a library, watched over by a rather abrasive Mr. Atos, a librarian who also has several holographic duplicates. He tells the boys that he is the last one left on the planet and he is leaving soon. All the others have used a device that reads discs and can send people back in time to a place they will enjoy being. Unfortunately for Kirk, he hears a screaming woman and rushes through a kind of portal and finds himself in a time lack that of the Three Musketeers. He is subdued and kept in prison, accused of being a witch. Simultaneously, Spock and McCoy make their ways through the portal, but find they have inadvertently used a disc putting them in the ice age. Nearly freezing to death, they are rescued by a beautiful woman in animal skins, played by Mariette Hartley. She had a magical quality as an actress. In a cave, over a hot spring, the twosome is given shelter. McCoy is practically frozen and Spock and the girl cover him to keep him warm. During this time, Spock, being 5000 years in the past, begins to revert to his primitive self. He and Mariette begin a bit of a relationship. His emotions, the emotions that the Vulcans avoided when they evolved, are back and he nearly kills McCoy. All principles have been told that they may never go back through the portal because they will die if they try. Kirk finds an ally as a judge from the time is also a time traveler.This is a highly creative episode that sets up conditions under which the characters must function. The plot ebbs and flows and keeps one involved. There are similarities to ""City on the Edge of Forever,"" my favorite, but it can stand on its own.",10

Besides the freezing temperatures and sanctuary to be found only in caves, there is a third inhabitant, the beautiful and so sexy Zarabeth (Mariette Hartley). As Spock spends more time in this era, he slowly begins to revert to the behavioral patterns of his ancestors, feeling a natural attraction to Zarabeth and throwing ""caution to the wind"" about ever leaving this place. Only with Dr. McCoy's constant ""reminders"" does Spock hold on to some grasp of reality.This stand as one of the few times when the character gets to show some ""emotion"" and Nimoy (Spock) plays it to the hilt, coming close to knocking the bejesus out of Deforest Kelly (McCoy).

7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" All Our Yesterdays (TV Episode 1969)",above average third season episode,"The next-to-last episode aired of the original Star Trek series is an interesting, sometimes melancholy installment that proves the show was still exploring its characters even at this point in the third season; though flawed, 'All Our Yesterdays' has its moments and overall a moody, compelling feel to it. Kirk, Spock, and McCoy beam down to a planet, assuming they are arriving in the nick of time to save or at least give some warning to whatever populace is there, since the planet's sun is due to explode within hours. But as it turns out, the people there are all too aware of the planet's fate, and using a kind of time travel device, have escaped into the past. Each person has been able to choose the time and place in the past where he or she would like to live at a 'library,' run by an elderly man named Mr. Atoz. Atoz assumes the three men are looking for a past to live in as well, and shows them various periods from which they can choose on viewers. There is some rather forced confusion at the start of the episode, with lines like:McCoy- Where did they go? Atoz- Wherever they wanted to.The misunderstanding could be cleared up rather easily, but for plot purposes, it isn't, and soon Kirk finds himself transported back to a period resembling 18th Century England, while Spock and McCoy are sent to an ice age, 5000 years in the planet's past. From here, the main focus is on Spock and his relationship with a woman exiled to this time by a tyrant as punishment. Spock begins acting increasingly emotional, showing anger toward McCoy and deep affection for Zarabeth, the woman. He eventually realizes that he is reverting back to the primitive emotional state of his ancestors on Vulcan, 5000 years ago. Kirk makes his way back to the library first, and finally convinces Mr. Atoz they don't belong in his planet's history. Spock and McCoy return just before it's too late, leaving Zarabeth behind; the Enterprise beams the three up and speeds away as the sun explodes, destroying the planet. The interaction between Spock and Zarabeth provides this episode's most memorable moments, though Kirk's adventure into the 'English' past is amusing. All in all, a very decent latter-day Star Trek outing.",7
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" All Our Yesterdays (TV Episode 1969)","""I should be able to solve this problem logically"".","Star Trek's approach to this time travel story took an interesting turn, as a planet's sole resident purposely stayed behind to transport it's inhabitants to the era of their choice in order to avoid it's destruction. Yet as I write this, it becomes apparent to me that it's still the same physical world that's going to come to an end, so escaping into the past wouldn't help much. Oh well, these kinds of contradictions popped up before, so best not to dwell on them.As they beam down to the planet Sarpeidon some three and a half hours before their sun, Beta Niobe is about to go nova, Kirk, Spock and McCoy meet Mr. Atoz (Ian Wolfe), standing vigilant against the few remaining hours left for the planet. Upon reflection, it didn't have to be such a mystery what Atoz's mission was; he could have explained it all very logically to his visitors. Presumably the only apparent reason for the forced misunderstanding was to send the Enterprise crew off into different directions through the library's time portal, thereby justifying the story.As we've seen in other Season III episodes, the series was taking advantage of Spock's workmanlike and serious Vulcan nature, and turning those conventions on their head to provide him with human emotion. In this one, with Spock and McCoy both trapped some five thousand years in the past, Spock begins to regress to the baser instincts of his Vulcan roots, feeling jealousy and rage as he begins to fall for cave-girl Zarabeth (Mariette Hartley). Eventually McCoy prevails with his own logic, but I have to wonder, would it have killed the writers to have Spock give Zarabeth a good-bye kiss when he left?Best line of the show for me had to do with the Captain's saving a Salem witch from an angry mob. Once safe, she says to Kirk - ""I thought I'd be limbered sure when that gull caught me cuttin' his purse"". But the concept that really blew me away was that first look at a future technology when Atoz introduced the atavachron. Who would have been able to say back in 1969 that we'd be watching Star Trek episodes over and over again on little round discs?",7

The Enterprise goes to the planet Sarpeidon to help the people before their sun becomes a supernova. Ship's scanners indicate there is no life on the planet. Kirk, Spock and McCoy beam down to investigate and run across one life, the librarian Mr Atoz. Mr Atoz scolds them for being very late. Atoz knows about the supernova and shows them the Atavachron, a time portal which he will escape into to be with his family. A woman screams and Kirk, by instinct, runs through the portal to save her, followed by McCoy and Spock while Mr Atoz yells at them to wait because they are not prepared. Kirk ends up in a place that is much like Earth's England in the 17th century. McCoy and Spock end up in the Sarpedidon's ice age. None of the 3 men can find the portal back to where they came from but they can hear one another from the area they stepped into. Spock is correct in speculating that all of the inhabitants (outside of Mr Atoz) has escaped the danger of the supernova by going into the planet's history. Now the 3 must find a way back to their own time and the Enterprise.Excellent episode that proves that season 3 is not nearly as bad as some have tried to make it out to be.

10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" All Our Yesterdays (TV Episode 1969)",Stands the test of Time...,"Following in the footsteps of seminal shows like THE TWILIGHT ZONE and THE OUTER LIMITS, STAR TREK often offered die-hard science fiction and fantasy fans some serious food for thought. STAR TREK gave us familiar faces on a regular basis, and the roster of Regulars was just about as varied as was possible- down to an extraterrestrial co-star, something even THE INVADERS couldn't boast. But, whereas THE INVADERS was set in (then) contemporary settings, STAR TREK boldly went where no teleseries had gone before- to the edges of the Galaxy. And it did so without tens of millions of dollars worth of cgi. An excellent example of what could be done with a minimum of means is ""All Our Yesterdays."" A character-driven story and superb performances (not to mention some outstanding if understated direction) belie this episode's sometimes obvious budgetary shortcomings. Mention must be made, too, of some striking lighting (often used effectively throughout the series) that greatly enhances the ice cave setting. STAR TREK was well ahead of its time, in many respects, and remains the standard by which all shows of its type will forevermore be judged.",10
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" All Our Yesterdays (TV Episode 1969)",An Interesting Idea Stretched Thin,"Kirk, Spock and McCoy beam down to a planet to warn its inhabitants of an impending disaster, only to find themselves trapped in the planet's past.""All Our Yesterdays"" has echoes of ""City on the Edge of Forever"" but takes the concept in a completely different direction. Instead of traveling into the past and trying to figure out how not to alter it and never mind how they get back, here they have to figure out how to get back and never mind how much they alter it. The point is, it's a twist on one of the most popular episodes of the series, so the elements are there for a great episode.Unfortunately, those elements never really come together. Kirk finds himself imprisoned in a Renaissance period and must find a way to escape; Spock and McCoy are trapped in an arctic wilderness and must find shelter. Neither story is particularly compelling, barely filling its time on screen. We also have a frame story set in a ""library"" where the time travel is managed. That part never feels like anything more than filler. It doesn't help that there's such a short time frame in which the story plays out. This is something that would have worked better over days, not hours.The best part of the episode is Spock's narrative, as he finds himself losing control of his emotions and falling in love with a woman trapped in the past with him. But that part of the episode doesn't quite make sense. We're told that the effects of time travel will be deadly, but Spock is the only one who shows any adverse effects at all -- and McCoy's explanation of the effects he suffers are nothing like what are described by others. (Speaking of McCoy, his accusations against Zarabeth seem unfounded, as far as anyone actually knows.) And the crew has traveled into the past before; why is it so deadly this time? And why doesn't Spock's phaser work?Ultimately what we are left with is a feeling of incompleteness. The away team members travel into the past, spend some time in an enclosed area talking to the locals, then return to their own time...and some scenes in a ""library"" fill out the time. For all that's at stake, nothing seems very urgent or grand. ""All Our Yesterdays"" is probably one of the better third-season episodes, but overall it's middle-of- the-road at best.",6
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" All Our Yesterdays (TV Episode 1969)",Another time travel storyline,"In this episode the Enterprise visits a library on a world whose sun is about to explode - presumably to transport anyone who is there to safety. When they arrive they find only a single strange little man, Mr Atoz, who is the librarian who has apparently already transported everyone else (via their world's Octavatron time transporter device) except himself to other time periods to live out the remainder of their lives. He mistakes Kirk, McCoy and Spock for stragglers and they mistakenly get transported to other time periods also. Kirk goes to a medieval time and Spock and McCoy go to a prehistoric frozen time - together. But there is a problem. The three haven't been ""prepared"" for the transfer so they have to get back somehow - which they manage to do by finding the time-space ""holes"" they came through from the library. Kirk barely escapes being burned as a witch and Spock falls in love with the previously transported and now very lonely Mariette Hartley character and eats ""animal flesh"" as he begins to revert to his barbaric, ancestral behavior. Fortunately, McCoy talks sense back into Spock (nearly getting cold-cocked by Spock in the process) and they all get back to the library in time for Mr Atoz to go through the Octavatron and the three heroes to get back to the Enterprise and outta there in time. Spock has to leave the woman he loves in the prehistoric past and all alone since her ""preparation"" for the Octavatron has rendered her unable to return back to the library again. Final scene back on deck of the Enterprise has Spock unusually somber and McCoy somewhat awkwardly understanding of him while Kirk is clueless about Spock's mood. Spock insists that he will be OK since, he reminds McCoy, those few minutes ago were in reality eons ago and ""she"" is now long since dead. Nevertheless says McCoy, ""It did happen Spock"". Episode thus ends with much to ponder for all.",
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" All Our Yesterdays (TV Episode 1969)",Great episode,One of the best episodes of TOS. Had more than just Kirk being the focal point. The interplay between Spock and McCoy was very good and definitely proves there was never any loveloss between the two. And Mariett Hartleys legs were incredible.,10
14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" All Our Yesterdays (TV Episode 1969)","One of the three best in Season 3, and I put it in my top 10 for the entire series.","IMHO, ""All Our Yesterdays"" is one of the three best in Season 3, and I put it in my top 10 for the entire series. I would also give it a score of 9/10. Here are some of my thoughtsFirst, we can agree that there are some holes in this plot. Yes, Spock's behavior reverts to his Vulcan ancestry whilst McCoy's does not. And yes, perhaps Mr. Atoz did not need to stay after everyone else had gone (although have you ever known a librarian that would close the library early if it was a slow day?) But how could everyone miss the first problem that I see – the Enterprise is coming to a planet that is about to be destroyed, to evacuate, presumably to their star ship, the entire planet's population (Thousands? Hundreds of thousands? Millions?) which will be destroyed by a supernova - in just over 3 hours? I mean, I know they can use the shuttle craft for the overflow crowd, but still. (Oh wait, if there are too many, Kirk will have to play Kodos the Executioner all over again?)All that aside, this is a great story. They were able to blend the concept of time travel into a story that is essentially a tragedy – Spock finding that rare place where he can spend his life with a woman who feels much like himself (Zarabeth: ""Do you know what it is like to be alone? Really alone?"" Spock: ""Yes. I know what it is like."")Like all fine stories, this one has many fine ideas just below the surface. The two most interesting ideas that I saw both involved Spock and Zarabeth. First, of the 4 primary characters that went back in time(Kirk, McCoy, Spock, and Zarabeth), only Zarabeth and Spock were changed – Zarabeth was changed by the Atavichron, Spock by his ""connection"" to his Vulcan ancestry. And because they were changed, they could both start a new life, different from the one into which they were born, and find happiness, on that island of solitude, with each other. The second idea is the one involving tragedy (fitting, since the episode's title comes from one of the greatest tragedies of them all). Zarabeth and Spock both shared tragedy. Zarabeth's was one of exile and solitude. She will never know love, physical affection, motherhood (the one thing that makes all women complete). And she would have had the chance for that, and more, with Spock, were he to remain. And she realizes this, even to the end (the single tear running down her face). And no less a tragedy is visited upon Spock. He is in love with Zarabeth, in a way that he could never be with any other woman, because the ancestral connection that is growing within him is allowing it. If you doubt this, just remember the last thing he wanted from Zarabeth – a moment alone with her to say good bye. (""How much time do we have?"") He even tries to throw McCoy into the portal ahead of him. But he cannot – they came through together and must return the same way. He can't even have that small, private moment with her, just the two of them. Tragic. And once Spock gets back, he is back to being trapped in his world of logic (""She is dead and buried, long ago.""), but with the memory of another type of life he could have led, one filled with warmth and love (ironically in the midst of a frozen wasteland). One more thing: The final shot of the Enterprise flying away, leaving the nova and the destruction of the planet behind, was one of the best images of the entire series. I agree with those who believe that it was this episode should have been the series finale.Finally, there is some great writing: McCoy: ""Spock, you pointy-eared Vulcan!"" ...Spock (grabs McCoy by the throat): ""I don't' like that. I don't think I ever did. Now I am sure.""Magistrate (pompously and officiously): ""I'm here to see that you get a fair trial in front of the Inquisitional Tribunal."" ...

Then again had they done so we would not have this episode at all.Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are an away team which beams down to a planet which has a humanoid civilization and orbits a sun about to go supernova in a matter of hours. All they find a library with a Gazillion discs showing the planet's history. The librarian Ian Wolfe and his duplicates are all that is left. William Shatner goes through the portal called the Atavacron after he hears a scream coming from the other side. He finds himself in a world that resembles Restoration England with people costumed that way. When Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley follow Shatner through they are in a prehistoric Ice Age and they are given shelter by Mariette Hartley who is an exile of sorts and understandably lonely for some company.I won't go into how the three got out of their predicament, but going back through time won't solve the planet's problem with the supernova when it does come. Unless those that go back change history so that research into space travel is done. I would have exacted that pledge from those going through the Atavacron.Interesting story, but the series has done better.",5
16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" All Our Yesterdays (TV Episode 1969)",Lacks depth,"While not containing any material that is glaringly awful, this episode ranks as one of the series worst for the worst crime in Hollywood: boring the viewer. The plot just didn't have the depth to carry the episode for 50 minutes. Kirk, Spock, and McCoy get thrown by accident into a planet's past and must get back to their own time. That's it. You just know eventually that they'll slip away from the locals back to the time portal and get home. There's also a love affair thrown in for Spock which is painful to watch because it is so poorly scripted and acted, and also because Spock doesn't do love affairs. And even if Spock did have love affairs, it would be with some witty and intellectual Vulcan, not a dim cave-woman. I could almost sense Nimoy's embarrassment in being forced to act out this plot line. The explanation that going back in time somehow changed Spock into his primitive ancestors was really implausible. Out of all the times and places in the past they could have been thrown, Spock just happens to end up with a young, pretty, half-dressed woman who is lonely and hungry for affection. What lazy and implausible script writing. It's bad enough when a trivial romantic subplot involves Kirk. We can partially forgive the script writers for this because Kirk's womanizing nature seems to attract such subplots. But when a trivial romantic subplot involves Mr. Non-emotional himself, it is jarring and annoying. It felt like this absurd subplot was thrown in just to kill as much time as possible because there was so little of other plot elements.",4
17,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" All Our Yesterdays (TV Episode 1969)",Last Great Star Trek Episode,"In ""All Our Yesterdays"", Kirk, Spock, and Bones beam down to the surface of a planet whose sun is going nova. The planet is reportedly populated but no one is there when they beam down. The last man there is the librarian and his replicas who are in charge of a strange machine. This planet is not warp capable but figured out time travel. The planet's residents have all escaped back in time to avoid demise. Kirk accidentally travels back through the portal to a time of swashbuckling swordsmen who believe he's a witch. Spock and Bones end up in the planet's ice age with a beautiful outcast sent here as punishment.Kirk is arrested and must figure out how to get back in time to reboard the Enterprise before the planet perishes. Bones is deathly I'll and requires shelter. He wants to return but Spock has devolved into his ancestorial lineage and is angry and wishes to stay with the woman. She claims they can't go back due to DNA transformation.In the end, an imprisoned Kirk escapes and finds the portal in time. Bones and Spock make it back just in time as well. They reboard the Enterprise moments before the star goes nova and live to see another day.I always have mixed feelings about these time travel episodes, the time continuity always makes my brain hurt. Like they're back in time, yet must hurry back before the planet explodes because the device is pegged to their time periods at a definite time difference? Yet there are so many people that went through the portal to different periods! Anyways, despite this I loved this episode.Half of the plot is devoted to Kirk trying to escape imprisonment and a witch trial but the real star here is Spock's relationship with Zarabeth. Spock devolving to an older, more tribal Vulcan is a bit silly but I just love it in this instance. Bones having to be the defender of logic here is an interesting role reversal for the two crew members who often bicker. Ian Wolfe is also great in his tertiary role.It's a fairly simple plot when it comes down to it: 3 friends trying to reunite but love and life continually gets in the way. Everything else is just sci-fi window dressing... but Star Trek is great at it.",9
18,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" All Our Yesterdays (TV Episode 1969)",THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE LAST EPISODE!,"After watching this episode several times I have come to the conclusion that this should have been the series finale. It was an absorbing trip backward in time, to the different aspects of various civilizations and the various stages of evolution---such as Vulcan in primitive times, the time of so-called witchcraft and how Kirk coped with it, the trials of poor Zarabeth and how she almost escaped...and how Kirk and Co. escaped back into the 23rd century just barely in time before the sun went supernova. I enjoyed this one and have always felt that it should have been the fitting conclusion to a superb series.",9

When sensors indicate the planet is uninhabited, Kirk, Spock and McCoy beam down to investigate.S3 of Star Trek is famous--or perhaps infamous--for its drastically reduced quality thanks in no small part to NBC slashing its budget. But there are a few highly regarded episodes from that final season, and one of them is ""All Our Yesterdays"".There's never any real explanation as to why or how the people of this planet created a device that allows them to go back in time, or why they chose to do this instead of simply fleeing their planet, but what it lacks in logic it makes up for by being a solid dramatic device. With a ticking clock and our heroes separated, there's a nice energy to the episode. Kirk's arc is pretty empty from a dramatic perspective, but as he's the one who can get them back to the present and off the planet before things go ""Boom!"", there's some nice intensity to his scenes. With Spock and McCoy, the gristle is the fact that Spock, 5,000 years in the past, begins to revert to the passion of his more barbaric ancestors. This creates nice tension to balance out Kirk's action oriented arc.A little more *ahem* logic to the plot device would've gone a long way toward making this a top-tier episode. As it stands, it's still pretty good, and if one grades it on a S3 curve, pretty darn good.The episode features a young and quite fetching Mariette Hartley.This was the second to last episode of ST:TOS to air.",7

Kirk hears a woman's scream, going towards it, sent to a period of musketeers and burned witches. Spock and Bones follow but they find themselves in an ice age, meeting Zarabeth, scantily clad in body part proportionate animal skins under a heavy fur coat and boots. Kirk speaks to his men on the other side of the time portal which has him considered a heretic who talks to dark spirits, imprisoned, and needing help from a prosecutor who came from the planet he wishes to return. That subplot is just not particularly exciting, and Kirk gets back to the planet with little suspense. The meat of the episode is Spock gradually reverting back to the barbarism and his growing lust/desire for a particularly fetching Mariette Hartley is fascinating to see develop to me. Bones ribbing him and how a less logical Spock doesn't tolerate it is rather startling...some might enjoy it considering Bones kind of has it coming. Wolfe as Azoz, the two genial replicas and the surly humanoid one, is fun in a limited bit of screen time, needing his arm twisted by Kirk to help get his men out of the ice age of 5000 years ago. Spock's logic slipping and the animal side emerging, along with his bond with Hartley, makes this a substantial episode.",7
21,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" All Our Yesterdays (TV Episode 1969)",A Season 3 (And Series) Standout,"By the time ""All Our Yesterdays"" appeared at the end of season 3, many fans had probably given up on the idea that ""Star Trek"" would actually be capable of producing another quality episode. Thanks to budget cuts and creator Gene Roddenberry abandoning ship, there were just as many bad episodes in Season 3 as there were good episodes in season 1. ""All Our Yesterdays"" starts out with the interesting premise that allows the viewer to imagine what it would be like to choose your own destiny in the time line of your existence. A planet is about to be destroyed by a natural outer space phenomenon when its people (who have had enough time to prepare) are allowed to choose some point in their planet's history to live out their lives. The plan is to ""prepare"" everyone before they go through a time portal so that once they are on the other side they are unaware of their actual past. This preparation also prevents them from returning. Kirk, Spock and McCoy are inadvertently shoved through the portal by the ""Librarian"", a caretaker who is frantically trying to get everyone to safety before the impending disaster. Kirk lands at a point in time similar to Earth's 17th century and finds himself accused of being a witch (after people hear the voices of McCoy and Spock on the other side of the portal). In the meantime McCoy and Spock are back in the planet's Ice Age where they are befriended by a lonely beautiful women who lives in a cave by herself. In addition to having to find their way back to the portal, Spock has started to revert to a more primitive version of himself complete with primal Vulcan emotions, adding another obstacle to their dilemma. The ultimate solution to their problem is believable and along the way we get to witness more of Kirk's ingenuity and bravery and get more insight to the complex relationship between Spock and McCoy. A very satisfying episode.",8
22,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" All Our Yesterdays (TV Episode 1969)",The past is another country,"With a star about to go nova Kirk, Spock and McCoy beam down to a moon which is apparently inhabited. They find themselves in a library where they meet Mr. Atoz is surprised to see them; he doesn't realise they are alien but thinks they should have been evacuated already. He tells them the population has been sent to anywhere they wished to go thanks to the use of the 'Atavachron' device. He invites the trio to look at various discs showing the planet's history; as Kirk views one he hears a scream come through a portal. He runs to help and as he steps through the portal he finds himself in a street where a woman is being harassed by men dressed like cavaliers; he helps her and returns to the area of the portal where he calls out to the others. They reply but they aren't in the library anymore; they tried to follow Kirk but as McCoy was looking at a disc which showed the planet's ice age they are in a frozen wasteland.Kirk soon finds himself arrested and charged with witchcraft because he is talking to disembodied voices while Spock and McCoy struggle to survive in the extreme cold. As McCoy lies freezing a person clad from head to toe in heavy furs approaches them and takes them to a warm cave. Here we learn that this person is Zarabeth; a stunning redhead who isn't wearing much under her furs! While McCoy recovers she tells Spock that she was sent there because of crimes committed by her family, she also explains that it is impossible to travel back as the machines changes people as they go back in time in a way that makes return fatal. Kirk meanwhile learns that because they weren't properly prepared they can return in fact if they don't they will die! As time passes there are noticeable changes in Spock; he starts showing emotions and falls for the beautiful Zarabeth.After several distinctly subpar episodes this is a real return to form. The idea of a society that hasn't developed space travel but have developed a means of allowing people to emigrate to the planet's past is both interesting and novel. Ian Wolfe does a fine job as Mr. Atoz and his duplicates the way are introduced to them was rather fun. Mariette Hartley is also good as the beautiful Zarabeth; her part in the story was enjoyable and a little tragic as there was no way to end her solitary exile in the frozen past when Spock and McCoy finally return. The fact that there was a time limit imposed by the Nova kept the tension higher than if they'd just been dealing with the problems in the past. Overall I'd say this is a really good episode; up there with the best in the series.",9

0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Turnabout Intruder (TV Episode 1969)",Capt.Kirk now knows the indignity of being a Woman,"There are many detractors of this episode, for reasons we'll get into in a bit, but one also cannot overlook several scenes of nearly rapturous, quasi-Shakespearean melodrama affixed to a science fiction plot line. Some of these scenes are unforgettable: Kirk physically attacking Janice Lester (now actually Kirk) as McCoy and Spock look on, shocked, fearing the worst; that tense, somber moment when Spock must decide to believe that Kirk is trapped in Lester's body; the entire hearing sequence, where Kirk (actually Janice Lester) steadily implodes into rampaging hysteria; the scene in the hallway directly afterwards, where Scott & McCoy plot their mutiny; Sulu & Chekov, nervously realizing how wrong things really are. These are incredible to watch, whether for the 1st or 10th time. But, the episode's strengths are not just these standouts; this isn't some half-baked attempt at role reversal. After Kirk's body is appropriated by Lester, the subtleties kick in: note how Shatner now says 'Captain Kirk to Enterprise' instead of his usual shorthand 'Kirk to Enterprise.' And, it's these subtle changes in his behavior that prove to be Lester's undoing, not the later screaming fits, when Lester knows she is losing her bid to retain control of the ship indefinitely. When Lester, in Kirk's body, first walks onto the bridge and starts issuing orders, we learn that the job of a starship captain is made up of many little details and any even minor deviation will start causing problems...and raised eyebrows (by, guess who?). It's pretty well thought out.Note also how, in logical order, Kirk's senior officers go over to his side, despite surface appearances of the usual routine: first Spock, of course, followed by Scotty & McCoy, then Sulu & Chekov; too bad Uhura is missing. In discussing Shatner's memorable interpretation of a female mind, we often forget Smith's performance as Kirk; the actress must have studied some of Shatner's past performances and it shows. Shatner, known for overacting in a few episodes - especially in the final season - gets to indulge himself here and it suits this particular episode very well. The viewer should remember that the female character, Lester, is an unbalanced woman, probably even deranged. She is not representative of the typical female of the 23rd century. This episode is not telling us that females, as a rule, are not suited to command positions. It's PC to buy into that, but I believe it's simply telling us that Lester is unsuited for command. Very few people are suited for command, in reality. When Lester, in the beginning, makes her comment about how Starfleet doesn't allow female starship captains, it seems to me as more of an attack, by Roddenberry, on the social mores of the sixties, a commentary on inequality (between males & females, in this case) similar to other statements by many 3rd season episodes on the status quo of that decade. We really don't know what Starfleet's approach is here, even though Kirk seems to agree with Lester on this point - perhaps he was humoring her - it's, again, more of a message to policymakers of the sixties. One could argue, tongue in cheek, that after this incident, Starfleet began an aggressive promotion program geared towards females, to avoid further such protests. We see the results on the TNG and Voyager shows. But, the next new Trek episode would be in animated form, in 1973. We had 3 good years. Well, 2 really good years and one pretty good year.",8
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Turnabout Intruder (TV Episode 1969)",Shatner tour de force finishes the 3 season run of the only Star Trek Series,"The final aired episode of the still critically attacked third season of the only Star Trek Series ends up being one of the finest displays of William Shatner's acting range, and an episode that meets the definition of what a Star Trek universe set story can be. Trek was meant to be a backdrop to good speculative story telling, but what a bonus for the viewers of the series- we got characters we loved, portrayed by actors with something oh-so-rare in filmed productions, be it television or the silver screen: perfect chemistry. Admittedly I can no recall ever seeing another story portraying male and female characters that swap their internal, natural genders our Captain, er, our Mister Shatner pulls it off with a verisimilitude equal to or surpassing his finest Trek moments (and to be fair and lauding, Sandra Smith as Dr. Janice Lester does a bang up job as Captain Kirk in, er, female clothing....). This final episode is clearly science fiction and reminds one of the initial season of ST- with moments here and there of pure involving meaningful sci-fi, the type that makes the hair on the neck stand up and the mind and heart wrap around the ideas coming from boffo writers of the ilk. As a student of the first school of Star Trek, in other words a person who saw it all first run (and in color!) I recall not so much being impacted that the episode could make one forget some of the ""ugh"" episodes of the third season (""Spock's Brain"" and ""And the Children Shall Lead"") but that something super extraordinary was ending. But the story stuck with me and over time additional viewings have shown that it (and so many more episodes of that season) maintained the Star Trek patented ability to conjure, entertain and, if I may be so droll as to pay a minor homage- fascinate.",
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Turnabout Intruder (TV Episode 1969)","Thanks to ABC, this episode was aired.","I remember this whole thing clearly, NBC pulled Trek after the Christmas Break, ABC made an arrangement to show the final episodes. This was the final Original Series episode, I remember it aired around the time of Apollo 11.As an episode, it is particularly sparse - The hallways of the USS Enterprise were void of the extras in uniform who used to always be walking around doing whatever business they were attending to. Uhura is missing, replaced by ""Angela"" (Barbara Baldavin) from ""Balance of Terror"" and ""Shore Leave""But something great does happen in this episode, a woman, Doctor Janice Lester who has developed a Khan-type obsession with Kirk performs the ultimate form of invasive personal space invasion - rape is maybe too strong of a word but in fact it describes what she has done to Kirk, humiliating him, stealing his identity, she stops short of murder- Which she was not able to do when given ample opportunity to do it.Both Television Actress Sandra Smith and William Shatner portray the madness of Janice Lester and the forlorn and deprived James T Kirk, who proves to Spock then to Bones and Scotty he is who ""she"" says he is.And we believe the progression of events, from the moment Lester takes control of Kirk's body, pretending to be him, initially acting as he would act, but rapidly giving Spock and McCoy reason to start questioning his actions and orders. Just knowing the facts about a person does not give one the ability to take over that person's life - Which Lester learns as she struggles and ultimately fails to keep up the facade. And she finally learns that just being IN command does not immediately invoke the obedience of Kirk's crew.In fact this episode was a very strong episode to go out with, in the two and a half years this show was on the air, we were introduced to all manner of impossible things, Miles Long Robots that chopped up planets into tiny chunks of rubble and ate them for lunch, a whole philosophy and history for Mr Spock and his ""Vulcanian"" people, Talosians, Klingons, Romulans... And we accepted it, but a lot of people cannot accept the concept of this episode, including the people IN the episode. But if we can believe in Warp Drive, we can believe that somewhere in this universe, something like this may happen or has happened.Even in Religion, the concept that God clothed himself in a Human Body is more widely accepted than the idea here that a machine can move the personality of one person into another's body and vice-versa. And there are people whose reputations are based on the former supposition, theologians and even Scholars, whose lives are based on believing it to be fact, even though this cannot be proved, and has to be accepted as a matter of Faith. And I say this with the utmost respect toward people who have Faith, not as an insult. Because I share the same Faith, yet I believe in Science.When it comes down to it, what are our personalities other than a collection of electrical impulses which wriggle around in a mass of protoplasm designed to store what we call memories? IN the future, computer science may allow those impulses to be stored and even be replaced later, just because it has not happened yet, does not mean it cannot ever happen.But this episode delivers this proposal almost in a way that it is rejecting it at the same time, which is another reason why it is great. Is this the most outlandish proposal of Trek? Never mind disassembling ourselves atom by atom and moving the whole mess to a transporter pad a planet's distance or a light year away... Never mind, intelligent creatures who are based on Silicon and can eat rock as it it were candy. Nevermind a ""barrier"" at the edge of the Milky Way Galaxy that if breached, can bestow Godlike Powers to people with High Esper ratings, or a similar barrier in the center of the Galaxy that is a prison to an entity that had been elevated to Pseudo-Godhood.Trek went out with this proposal, it was as hard for us to swallow as it was for Shatner and Smith to act it out, and nobody can say either of those fine actors failed to make us believe that it really happened. But also noteworthy, was that Kelly, Nimoy, Doohan, Koenig, the absent Nichols, and Takei all made us believe that they would follow Kirk - The REAL Kirk, to the barriers of this galaxy and back.",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Turnabout Intruder (TV Episode 1969)",brilliant performance by Shatner despite its problematic premise,"Many Star Trek fans have criticized Wiliam Shatner's 'overacting' in this episode but I must disagree. If Star Trek had a more cerebral or passive captain like Jeffrey Hunter, the first captain in Star Trek's pilot, the series might not have survived into a second season--let alone a third. Kirk's acting abilities was what made this episode, and the entire Star Trek series, believable. I rate his performance here as outstanding at a generous 9 out of 10 but the movie's premise--is unfortunately more problematic. Essentially, Kirk's body gets kidnapped by his former lover Janice Lester (played by Sandra Smith) who has gone jealously insane over the fact that Starfleet apparently doesn't allow women captains. While the script may have been intended as a social commentary on the 1960's, it doesn't quite work for a Star Trek series that was supposedly set in the 23rd century. Surely by then, women would have risen up the ranks to become captains of starships! While it seems implausible that Kirk would allow his body to be kidnapped on Camus II by an alien device, this cannot be dismissed outright. As Spock rightly notes, the Enterprise has been to many new places and witnessed many strange events. Moreover, Kirk was once cloned in 'What are Little Girls Made of?' and even split into two in 'The Enemy Within.' Both Lester's and Kirk's acting are excellent: I liked the part where Lester (as Kirk) bites his nails like a woman or the trap that Lester (Kirk again) sets for McCoy and Scotty when the latter two men privately voice their concern over the Captain's recent odd and capricious behaviour towards the crew and raise the idea of mutiny. You could really cut the tension between the increasingly belligerent and unstable Kirk (Lester here) and the Enterprise crew with a knife. Turnabout Intruder is generally underrated because 1. it was the last Classic Trek show and 2. it touched on the inexplicable premise that women could not be starship captains--a very radioactive topic in our more mature 21st century society. If the script writers had said Starfleet disqualified Janice Lester from being a ship's captain since she was mentally incapable of handling the heavy responsibilities involved with the job or suffered from a disease which curtailed her decision making faculties, this may have been a better received episode. However, the show turned out out quite well overall. Lester really goes berserk when she realises she is losing her grip on the captaincy and panics. What really trips her up are the little minor subtleties such as when she repeatedly says ""Captain Kirk"" rather than ""Kirk"" and when Angela asks Lester (as Kirk) if the captain would like to notify Starfleet of their course change and Lester (as Kirk) responds by questioning the crew's loyalty until Spock reminds the captain that he/she usually deals with these issues alone. So, its little surprise that the crew notices their captain is not behaving like the person they know. When Spock sees Janice Lester (ie. Kirk here), the latter actually recounts their adventures together in previous episodes--something which never happened in any other prior TOS show. Given the fact that Star Trek was about to be cancelled by the time of the making of ""Turnabout Intruder,"" its amazing that Kirk and Lester pulled off their acting parts so well. A rating of 7 or 8 stars for the last Star Trek episode is reasonable due to its intriguing premise. While Turnabout Intruder was not a classic, it was one of the more appealing and entertaining Star Trek episodes of the generally poor third season and rates high in my view. Kirk's haunting last words: ""If only If only.."" left me wondering if Star Trek could have carried on into a fourth season and witnessed man's landing on the Moon had it not been neglected by NBC? Sadly, we'll never know.",8
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Turnabout Intruder (TV Episode 1969)",strange but intriguing finish to original series,"While 'Turnabout Intruder' strikes many as an odd choice to conclude the original Star Trek's run on network TV, I think it's important to consider that in all likelihood, nobody involved at the time of shooting knew it would be such. Hell, NBC probably didn't even know until they realized they had one unaired episode left in the can and figured they might as well broadcast it, which they did in June '69. The episode is certainly one of the better third season shows, with an intriguing premise and the almost irresistible notion of Shatner portraying a woman stuck inside Kirk's body. He has a lot of fun with the performance, in ways both flamboyant and subtle, believe it or not. For instance, in the first scene where Lester inhabits the captain's body, and Kirk uses his communicator, he jerks back just slightly, almost imperceptibly, upon hearing a voice come from the device for the first time. It's one of many nice little touches Shatner employs to create a convincing impression of an unbalanced woman occupying his physical form. While the episode is far from perfect, there are some nice scenes, and one in particular is wonderful-the court martial sequence, which ends with Lester/Kirk exploding in rage at Mr. Spock. It's a classic moment in the episode, and in the series. There was certainly no inkling in 'Turnabout Intruder' that it was the last Star Trek; it ended with Kirk, Spock, and Scotty walking off down a corridor while the captain lamented Dr. Lester's self-inflicted misery. As a side note, I agree that it is an odd comment Dr. Lester makes at the beginning of the show about women not being permitted to command starships. Despite someone's well-intentioned remark here, there's no question what her statement meant, and Kirk even confirms it in his response. It stands as an example of how things were at the time... no more, no less.",7
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Turnabout Intruder (TV Episode 1969)","Great Episode, Not The Bad One I Remember as a Child","I was dreading when this episode came up in my viewing the DVD entire seasons run for Trek, for two reasons; there aren't anymore episodes to watch after this and I always thought this episode was one of the worse. Well, that recollection was from childhood experiences and not picking up on the nuances that are present here, I basically, as a child, just thought of one person taking over Kirks body. Watching it now (without commercials is a huge difference to watch this show), I immediately picked up the sex change angle, and that is really really interesting and funny. Kirk doing his nails, and having a slight ""spring"" to his step, are things I had definitely not noticed before, its GREAT! Anyway, I have panned this episode in other comments I posted here, and that was really wrong, I should have re-watched first, because despite the low budget of the script , it's really an entertaining episode! OK, now to pose a question here, I'm Kirk put into the body of a pretty woman, when I go to the bathroom, do I have a slight urge to play around, just a little? LOL. Same thing for the woman inside Kirks body, LOL. I do have a dirty mind but c'mon, Kirk was driven by many things in life and sexuality was definitely one of them. Wish the show had kept going of course but in a way thats why it has lasted so long, the little bit we got just wasn't enough, we needed a bunch of spin offs and motion pictures to satisfy our desire for more Trek. There will, in my opinion, never be another show as great as this as far as sci fi is concerned. I'll always be a Trekkie, LLAP.",9
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Turnabout Intruder (TV Episode 1969)",Turnabout feelings for 3rd season,I have recently been watching the repeat of the 3rd season on the British version of the Sci Fi Channel. I remember as a kid back in 1973 being so disappointed with a lot of the third season after the highs of the previous two.However I have come to enjoy them more now as there were early signs of the series trying to evolve into something for the 1970's (Being cancelled in 1969 it never quite made it). I think if they could have had a little more money to up the production values the third season could have been very good.Although not one of my favourites - 'The Lights of Zetar' did appear to feature the first computer graphics (see the main view screen shot when the alien is approaching the library planet). Perhaps the special effects guys had been to watch 2001.So onto the final episode - well it's not bad - if not a little camp - but I agree with the previous comments that Shatner did pull it off well. With a better script it could have rivalled 'What are Little Girls Made of?' I would love to hear from fellow Trek fans about their favourite 3rd season episodes,7
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Turnabout Intruder (TV Episode 1969)",Palpable suspense,"I would consider this episode to be one of Star Trek's finest. While many episodes are cartoonish fun without any real sense of danger, this episode combines excellent acting, convincing dialog, and an unpredictable plot in order to give us a suspenseful tour de force. A power hungry woman, Dr. Lester, forcefully and secretly swaps minds with Captain Kirk in order to take command of the Enterprise. Once inside Kirk's body, she must act just like Kirk in order to avoid suspicion, and she must also kill the real Kirk now stuck in the her body. However, the crew knows the real Captain Kirk too well to be deceived for too long. This episode explores an interesting situation: if your mind were transferred to someone else's body to your detriment, how would you convince others of your true identity without them thinking you have gone mad. Kirk quickly discovers the best route: get to someone you know best.This episode is memorable not only for what it did show but what it didn't. A man-woman mind switch storyline could so easily degrade into sexist farce played for cheap laughs. This episode does not do that. Instead, Dr. Lester in Kirk's body is fully capable of running the star ship from the perspective of training and intelligence, despite being a woman. Dr. Lester's real problem is not that she is a woman, but that she has become mad with jealousy and hunger for power. Her other real problem is that she is not really Captain Kirk down to every last mannerism and thus cannot fool the crew. Dr. Lester's failure comes because of madness and dishonesty, not because of her gender. Also, the theme that she was denied a deserving command years ago because of gender discrimination could have become annoyingly preachy. But instead of insulting the intelligence of the viewer with sermons, the producers just subtlety drop hints that gender discrimination can have far-reaching negative effects. Also, this episode did not show an un-scifi plot that could have happened in any detective or crime show. The final thing that this episode thankfully leaves out was Kirk kissing and schmoozing yet another female. I'm sure some people enjoy this facet of Star Trek, but whenever a romance is thrown into a Star Trek storyline, I find it badly written, poorly acted, and simply distracting to the main plot. It's even worse if the victim of Kirk's affections is an alien. Do you really think a different species would be romantically attracted to aliens? (Do you dream of kissing a squid?) Fortunately, in this episode, instead of the preacy-ness, sexist humor, un-scifi plot, and womanizing of so many other episodes, we get a surprisingly mature and engaging production to close out the series.The other facet I like about this episode is it's take on the nature of authority in a just society. While it's true that Kirk's authority to command the ship is respected primarily because Starfleet Command backs up his authority, there is something more important and subtle in establishing authority without resorting to being a tyrant: competency. Competency in a command post goes beyond basic fitness for the job according to the rule book; it also entails respecting an unwritten cultural code, working for a greater good, having a knack for insight into the details, and having a leadership persona that projects confidence, restraint, wisdom, and control. The crew of the Enterprise does not follow Kirk's orders so enthusiastically just because Starfleet Command requires it. Rather, they trust him because of his competency and leadership skills. While Dr. Lester had all the training and knowledge to command a ship according to the book, she lacked the competency to be a true leader. The crew quickly picked up on this.",8
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Turnabout Intruder (TV Episode 1969)","""I expect only to reveal the truth"".","With the general dearth of good episodes in the final season of Star Trek, this one finished out the series equaling some of the best. It certainly keeps the viewer focused on keeping the main players, Captain Kirk and Janice Lester (Sandra Smith) straight, as their identities are switched with a 'life entity transfer' known only on the planet Camus II. The reason for Lester's hijacking of Kirk's body involves revenge over a fling they had back in the Academy days, along with a more determined goal of commanding a starship. Though the subject wasn't broached in any of the prior episodes, one today wonders why Starfleet would have taken such a sexist view about women in command, but this was the Sixties, and not all the panels of the glass ceiling had been cracked yet.The story relies on Lester/Kirk (Lester in Kirk's body) maintaining the ruse as the rest of the crew become increasingly wary that something's not quite right. Spock of course is the first to formulate an opinion, but it's interesting to watch the others fall into line - Scotty, McCoy, Chekov and Sulu, especially when Lester/Kirk strikes Kirk/Lester in a physical confrontation. However the story planted the seed of how Dr. McCoy could have proved the identity of Lester/Kirk with the old Robbiani Dermal-opic test, but she/he passed the exam. My question is how? The procedure was designed to check the basic emotional structure of the patient, and McCoy himself stated that it should match the results of a prior test done on Captain Kirk. There's no way Lester/Kirk's results should have been a match to my thinking, so right there you had a plot hole. It would have been better if that point wasn't brought up in the first place.Maybe it's being a bit nit-picky, but it also seems to me that it would have been easy enough to confirm the real Captain's identity by posing a question, particularly during the mutiny hearing, that only the real Captain Kirk would know. Matters of record that were referred to surely wouldn't prove anything, as was briefly mentioned. But between them, Spock, McCoy and Scotty, there would have been any number of purely personal moments that wouldn't have had anything to do with Starfleet service that might have resolved the identity issue.It looks like my arguments here might be on the critical side, but in actuality, I found the episode overall quite compelling. Basically I think that's because the story forced you to keep focus on who was who, by keeping your attention on those minor nuances in Lester/Kirk's character. An example was when she/he used the communicator - 'Captain Kirk to the Enterprise' instead of 'Kirk to Enterprise'. Very subtle, but if you saw enough episodes you knew things were just slightly a bit off. It was clever of the writers to use these little devices, as they were peppered throughout the story with entertaining effect.",8
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Turnabout Intruder (TV Episode 1969)",Extreme and subtle all at once,"This is one of my favourite episodes of Season Three. In fact, of the whole show, to be honest. I can understand the criticisms regarding the OTT acting and the perception of gender bias, but I couldn't disagree more. The major strength of this episode lies in its searing portrayal of a character's distaste for her own gender identity. Janice Lester is primarily concerned with achieving the perceived masculine glory of being a starship captain. The alien technology also allows her to revenge herself upon Kirk by condemning him to the ""indignity"" of being a woman. Kirk himself comments that ""her intense hatred of her own womanhood made life with her impossible."" Lester is not just railing against the sexism of Starfleet (although I accept that this is a valid criticism), she is permanently at war with herself. Her agony is palpable, as is Kirk's sad weariness: ""We'd have killed each other.""As to Shatner's performance, I think it is terrific. For all of his blustering hysteria, he is also incredibly subtle. The way he runs his hand over the back of his head as he (as Lester) admits that he walked out on her when the relationship became serious. Not only does this appear shame-faced, but there is a tiny smirk on his face as Lester drops Kirk in it to an obviously uncomfortable McCoy. The business with the nail-file, especially as he wags it in McCoy's direction, the way he rather sensually touches Dr Coleman, his ludicrous girlish tutting at the hearing, his walk - it is all very telling, very clever.The only (teensy) thing that I don't like about this episode is the scene between Chapel and Kirk (in Lester's body). Kirk is condescendingly saccharine in response to Christine's rather unbelievable loyalty to Coleman as her new boss. I just can't believe she would be so dense - although Kirk being so smarmy is no surprise, and was well portrayed by Sandra Smith.Oh, it's all good stuff!",8
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Turnabout Intruder (TV Episode 1969)",Classic Star Trek- Turnabout Intruder,"Notoriously considered by Classic Trek fans to be one of the show's all-time worst episodes, I would be lying if I didn't admit (as my rating for it proves) I loved it wholeheartedly—admittedly, for all the wrong reasons. Keeping a straight face must not have been easy for the cast, and Shatner is so wonderfully over-the-top, his pure camp performance is the gold standard of overacting. The story is a humdinger: Kirk, McCoy, and Spock transport to a planet suffering a radiation disaster that has taken members of an archaeological site, including an old acquaintance of the Captain's, Janet Lester, who seems to be ill from exposure as well. While Spock and McCoy are seeing the casualties with the site's medical physician, Dr. Coleman (Harry Landers), Lester (Sandra Smith), turns on a peculiar machine that ""freezes"" Kirk, so he cannot move. This machine allows Lester to ""switch identities"" with Kirk, the reason, besides envy and jealousy for his exploring the stars, so she can be Captain of the Enterprise! Spock would later refer to this as ""life entity transfer"" That's quite a doozy an idea, to see Shatner's Kirk possessed by the identity of a treacherous, nefarious, clever woman who is brilliant in regards to studying the Enterprise, but too emotional for her own good. Shatner seems to be having a field day, allowed to be free of Kirk's seriousness, fortitude, and moral compass. And, boy, do we get a wide range of emotional outbursts, sneaky smiles, illogical reactions, and smug indifference towards other officers, like Bones and Spock, who know Jim Kirk, the man and Captain, having quite the dilemma in that proving this through concrete evidence will not be easy. Sandra Smith does a bang-up job imitating Kirk's strong personality and orderly manner, her demeanor and way of talking pretty close to the Shatner method we know so well. Seeing Bones and Spock grappling, as both always do in their own ways, with the fact that Jim is trapped in the body of a woman, while her identity is at home in the body of their Captain, the one in charge, is compelling, I must say, even if the performance of Shatner as the lecherous Janet had me in ribbons.Towards the end when Kirk's body temporarily loses Janet's identity as the transference seemed to be weakening had me in stitches, the way his face conveys mortal terror (Janet is facing the horrifying thought of losing her new host body) and stunned silence, the physical jarring reaction accompanying the fish-out-of-the-aquarium suck-face, it is a sight to behold. Spock faces possible court martial for his *mutinous* ways (he attempts to help Janet (Kirk) flee her sick bay, held there by security at the orders of Kirk (Janet). We get a Vulcan mind meld (Spock reassures his suspicions by truly feeling Kirk within the mind of Janet's body) and a Vulcan neck pinch (two, in fact), so ""Turnabout Intruder"" has those going for it. Seeing Janet get all hysterical and confrontational during the ""trial"" of Spock is certainly a treat as Shatner holds nothing back, quite an acting assault. God, was this episode fun.I will say this, Lester was truthful in that females deserved to captain starships, it was her extreme methods at acquiring the post that ruins her argument, not to mention, the deterioration of her psyche comments on how not having the same opportunities as Kirk seems to have affected her psychologically. There seems to be a message here about ""being trapped in a woman's body"" and gender politics, but I think it gets lost in the shuffle thanks to Shatner's delightful histrionics.",10
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Turnabout Intruder (TV Episode 1969)",Original Series Ends on a (relatively) High Note,"OK, when I say ""relatively"" keep in mind that we're talking about the lackluster season 3 here. But this episode manages to be entertaining, thanks in large part to William Shatner's portrayal of Kirk's psycho ex g/f's consciousness occupying the captain's body (Sandra Smith also does a good job with Kirk's consciousness occupying the body of the aforementioned ex, Dr. Janice Lester). It's fun to watch as Kirk's senior officers, one by one, come to realize what's really going on, while at the same see Dr. Lester occupying Kirk become more and more hysterical. She/he reveals her complete insanity when she tries to have all the senior officers executed for mutiny. The frightening thing is, had the transference not been broken, she might well have ultimately succeeded, as security continued to back the false Captain. Intentional or not, it provides some insight as to how some of these crazies throughout history become dictators and hold power even after committing atrocities against their people. There's a continuity issue (as often happens in this series) when Spock, among others, says he's never seen a transference between bodies happen before (he seems to conveniently forget ""Return to Tomorrow,"" but I digress). Overall, a pretty good episode, highlighted by Shatner's fine acting job (in this case ""overacting"" was definitely called for).",6
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Turnabout Intruder (TV Episode 1969)",Entertaining 'Star Trek',"I'm going to simply ignore the supposed 'political incorrectness' of the story line to point out that this was an interesting episode for television at the time. Rather than turn a perfectly good Star Trek episode into a diatribe about sexism...it's fun to watch Kirk as a bitch on wheels. I agree with previous writer that Ms. Smith is not a strong enough actress to do justice to her 'Kirk' persona, but it's a minor point.The title 'Turnabout Intruder' is interesting. Hal Roach produced a film back in the forties with Carole Landis called 'Turnabout'. It was a fantasy based on Thorne Smith's book. The story line is the same, except that the sexual transformation is sealed by praying to a Buddah-like statue.It's a rather amusing movie and a novelty, if not altogether successful. No doubt someone involved in this episode had a recall of this old film, hence the title 'Turnabout Intruder'.Hey, try to remember, it's just a TV show....",7
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Turnabout Intruder (TV Episode 1969)",Shatner acting as a woman,"This is my really short review of Turnabout Intruder. If you are a fan of watching the William Shatner school of acting, this episode gives you a chance to see it at its best (or worst?). Basically, Shatner must act as if he is a woman, with all the negative stereotypes of a envious, deceiving revengeful female. He has to pull this off without acting too effeminate, but enough so that one can see the woman inside the man. In effect, he has to be a man inhabited by a woman. In his character as inhabited by Lester, he seems to have a possible romantic association with her partner in crime, Mr. Coleman. At one point Kirk puts his (or her) hand on Coleman's shoulder and just gives a glimpse of a man being a woman showing a certain, shall we say, physical closeness. He has to do this without looking gay. It's a very daring scene that Shatner actually pulls off. The basic story plot is not so interesting and the feminism aspect does not hold up to the passage of time. But the work of Shatner and his acting style make watching the episode worth it.",6
14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Turnabout Intruder (TV Episode 1969)",The end of the beginning,"Airing in June of 1969, ""Turnabout Intruder"" was aired as an afterthought (as TV shows typically bowed out during March and April back then), and in some ways was produced as an afterthought: the climax of this episode seems excessively rushed, robbing an interesting premise of the time and care it deserved.Instead, the series' only episode focused primarily on gender issues comes across as an impediment to the wrap party. Add this to the fact that Dr. Lester, disturbed as she might be, might actually be *right* about the Starfleet of the Original Series, and you have a less-than- fitting end to a landmark television program.This isn't to say that the entire episode is bad: Sandra Smith turns in an excellent performance as Dr. Lester, and more importantly, Kirk-in-Lester's body, better than Shatner's rushed take as Lester-in-Kirk's body. Also, there are numerous references (primarily by Smith as Kirk) to previous episodes, a nice touch in this, the final episode of the series.What probably disturbs me the most about this episode is how poorly it has aged since I first saw it in the mid '80s. While Janice Lester is clearly off her rocker, the direction seems uncharacteristically harsh towards her. After all, we've seen a number of captains (and a few commodores, as well as a collection of admirals and high-ranking civilians) on Star Trek, and other than Chris Pike, Matt Decker, Garth, and Bob Wesley, they're generally a fairly pathetic bunch (and even Decker and Garth were all too human), validating Lester's claim that she could also do the job just as well, if not better. It's almost like the rare episodes of The Twilight Zone where the good characters are punished-while there might be a ""good"" ending, the viewer is ultimately cheated, as justice has clearly not been served.But, then again, maybe that's the point-viewers in 1969 were clearly not content with the end of Trek, and they turned a failed TV show into a cultural icon.",6
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Turnabout Intruder (TV Episode 1969)",Kirk swaps bodies with an old flame in the final episode of 'Star Trek',"When the Enterprise responds to a distress call from the planet Camus II Kirk is confronted by the sight of Dr. Janice Lester, a woman he once loved. It turns out they went their separate ways because Dr. Lester couldn't have hoped to become a captain in Star Fleet because of her gender; something she is still bitter about. While Spock and McCoy are away with another survivor, Dr. Arthur Coleman, she activates a strange alien device which switches her consciousness into Kirk's body and vice versa! Now in Kirk's body she tries to strangle Kirk, who is in her body. Luckily the others return but things are still perilous for Kirk; Dr. Coleman sedates him while Dr. Lester takes over the role of Captain of the Enterprise. Determined that the switch remains undiscovered she orders Dr. Coleman to be in sole charge of 'Janice Lester'. Eventually the real Kirk wakes up but it will be almost impossible to prove who he really is; Spock believes him after a mind-meld but acknowledges that that doesn't count as scientific proof. Meanwhile all Dr. McCoy's tests show that the person who appears to be Kirk is Kirk. Of course Lester may be in Kirk's body but she still has her own personality and that means her behaviour starts to seem aberrant as she tries to deal with the claims about 'body-swapping' followed by accusations of mutiny against the senior crew.This, the last ever episode of the original Star Trek series proves to be a good send-off; it is far better than many of the weak stories featured earlier in season three. The idea that women's opportunities may still be so limited in the far future may seem a little less likely today than they did in the '60s but that doesn't spoil the story. It is clear that Dr. Lester's personality makes her unfit for command whatever her gender and no doubt if there were no glass ceiling she's have still found a reason to blame for her lack of success. Once the body-swap has occurred the episode has an almost claustrophobic feel as Kirk is trapped in another body, struggling to be believed. William Shatner puts in an entertaining performance as he plays the woman in a man's body; he nicely captures some feminine details although things get hilariously hammy as she starts to lose her grip on power and the switch starts to reverse. Guest star Sandra Smith excels as Kirk when he is in Dr. Lester's body. Overall a fine episode; it is just a shame that it was the last of this classic series.",9

Not a terrible episode, but kind of a gratuitous effort to address women's issues, budding in the sixties. This is a chance for Shatner to play a part he never pictured, that of a woman. Actually, he does a very good job. He appears to have studied female mannerisms and adapted them well, and I believe he does it in a respectful way. This could have deteriorated into some silly comedic episode that occasionally diminished the dignity of the series. Of course, it wouldn't have mattered as the death knell had already been delivered. If there is a criticism, it takes a woman who is striking out against the glass ceiling, being portrayed as a you know what in men's clothing. For me, this is quite a forgettable episode. It goes out, not with a bang but a whimper.",7
19,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Turnabout Intruder (TV Episode 1969)",Severe bi-polar,"Trek takes us to yet another psychological battlefield where a one Janice Lester, former romantic interest of Captain Kirk, harbors an old grudge immersed in the sexism of the time. She blames her failures, problems and lack of success on the fraternity that is starship captaincy. Is she wrong? Probably not. But the extent to which she is willing to compromise basic human values to ascertain her goal demonstrate not only an unbalanced mind, but one knitted together by strands of anger and hate.Her own biochemical composition in her brain chemistry exaggerates her fears and desires to measures we cannot imagine. She is more than just obsessed with becoming a starship captain (woman starship captain, no less). It is a vendetta for her. A white wale of sorts that has done her wrong, and she means to exact revenge in any way possible to achieve her ends.On the surface she's calm and almost pathologically in control of her emotions. She barely cracks a smile. Her behavior is so normal as to be abnormal. Whereas everyone else seems to have casual interactions. Lester is not only emotionally charged to the point of psychological imbalance, but she is also a genius. This makes her dangerous. She holds onto her hate no matter what.And that's pretty much the driving force for the episode. We're given a ""treat"" of sorts as we witness Shatner interpret a female character driven to vengeful madness. The performance is a bit over the top, but it is fairly much on the money. I wonder if he and Sandra Smith didn't talk about the character and do some rehearsals so Shatner could get Smith's nuances just right. I'd be surprised if they didn't.As with all Star Trek episodes we know there's going to be a positive outcome of sorts. The antagonists and other protagonists who are not part of the crew may get screwed in the end, but Kirk and crew will come out okay. So it is that when Kirk, as the superego of the Enterprise, is driven into the body of another human (a woman no-less), it is his ID (McCoy) and logical side (Spock) that must come to bring Kirk's body and mind back to operational norms (to borrow from Vulcan English).It's a low budget episode that, like for nearly all 3rd season Trek) relies on plot, story and performances to carry the show. There aren't a whole lot of SFX here, and the sets are mostly interiors of the ship. We're given the opportunity to witness the infamous schlocky b-movie plot device (brain transfer) in full swing in an episode of Trek, and treated with a kind of seriousness that allows us to examine what makes people tick.Trek was again on the cutting edge as we see the psychology of a person who is infused with the worst kind of fusion imaginable; an unbalanced mind married to a history of being wronged. Unlike the rest of us, Janice blamed her emotional woes on an old love and society as a whole, unable to realize that even though she had suffered in her view heinous discrimination (which, in my book, and you can call me a sexist jerk isn't so heinous, as I believe starship captains should be males), she herself had physiological issues that lent her to overreact in the first place. Unable to realize that she is part of the issue, she schemes to take over and murder the mental sum-total of Captain James T. Kirk; his essence or spirit, if you will.All in all it's a pretty mundane episode as far as classic Trek goes. Shatner throws one punch to knock out Janice who is inhabited by Kirk's mind. No phasers are fired. No Klingons or other usual baddies show up, nor is the galaxy imperiled (yet again). All in all not a sterling episode as such, but one worth watching for the character study.Enjoy.",

The lady appears to be gravely ill, but when she is alone with Kirk, she is surprisingly spry and zaps him--dragging him to an ancient sex-change machine that puts the woman's mind in Kirk's body and vice-versa. The results are unintentionally hilarious--almost as campy and silly as PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE!!! Normally, Shatner isn't exactly subtle in his role as Captain Kirk, and most of us have come to love this campy overacting. However, here, he plays a hysterical and mentally ill woman now residing within his body and the results are just bizarre and completely off the top of the overacting chart! He shrieks and belows and pounds and behaves like a woman who is experiencing every pain of a lifetime of PMS all in one very, very bad day!!!! So, what we have here is a mighty stupid premise combined with shameless overacting as the rest of the actors watch Shatner bellow and wildly gesticulate. No wonder the series was canceled with episodes like this one! Nowhere is there any evidence of the brilliance of earlier episodes.UPDATE: By the way, it isn't just me who hated this episode.

As a girl, I was intrigued by her performance, finding an incredible depth of integrity portrayed by the woman as she embodied Kirk's personality in a female body. What this gave to me was a picture of woman with balanced power and integrity, and I would call that rather a strongly positive feminine image. I know much has been written of this episode as derogatory and sexist, but I entirely disagree. When Shatner was portraying the personality of Janice Lester, it was of a person entirely ego-centric, without the balance of true leadership capabilities that come from thinking of the bigger picture -- the overall good of everyone, not simply personal glory or accomplishment.Sandra Smith's portrayal remained for me a great and frankly, timeless, image of woman as leader and balanced wielder of power and authority. For the feminists, that's not something missing from history or Scripture for that matter; it's just sadly not really discussed when speaking of ambitions for ""equality.""",10

But now that we've elected a black president and seem poised to elect a woman president in the next election this particular episode loses a bit of its verisimilitude.Nevertheless this particular Star Trek story gives William Shatner one of his opportunities and since this was the last episode of Star Trek prime a great one to say adieu to that first run audience. Ditto for Sandra Scott who plays both the envious Dr. Janice Lester and Captain James T. Kirk trapped in Lester's body.The Enterprise arrives on a rescue mission on a distant planet to save the members of an expedition taken with radiation exposure.

Now Dr. Lester has fulfilled her fondest dreams. She who washed out of Star Fleet Academy is now captain of a starship. But in William Shatner's body she soon displays why she just didn't belong in Star Fleet let alone in command of a ship.The episode does raise some discrimination issues and oddly enough the one woman regular in Star Trek wasn't in this final show. Perhaps Gene Roddenberry didn't want Nichelle Nichols in it for some personal reason. I think the unflappable Lieutenant Uhura at her communication station doing her job while Lester as Kirk unravels would have been a great contrast.Though real future events have dated the episode I think it still has a lot to say about women's equality.,5

The audience of '67 was plunged into the first detailed vision of Vulcan mystique, rituals and ceremony, and most, I would gather, would be quite surprised. Up until this point, the one facet of Vulcan culture which the show stressed (during the 1st season) was logic. When the subject of Vulcan mating methods (itself a daring theme during sixties TV) comes up during this episode, all of us, like Kirk, assumed it would all follow along those logical lines. Not even close. An ancient culture, the Vulcans are still subject to and participate in ancient traditions which precede their turn to logic. But, who would have guessed it would be this violent, this primal? Contradictions in Spock's behavior abound during this episode and I believed this added to the entire wonderment many fans already had in respect to Spock and his history. Though logic supposedly determines Spock's actions, he keeps his secrets about his sudden need to visit his home planet, even though such an approach would surely cause his death. It doesn't seem like he was counting on Kirk's persuasive abilities as a friend to break through his Vulcan guardedness; instead, Spock seems hellbent on perishing, wrapping himself in solitude and loneliness. The music during these sequences in Spock's quarters conveys an overwhelming sense of melancholy, and it's quite a depressing mood - all the actors are at the top of their game here. I'd have to say my favorite scene, however, is in the turbolift with the main trio; Spock requests Kirk to accompany him down to the planet, as a close friend; there is a pause, and then, as we anticipate, he asks McCoy the same thing - no wisecracks from McCoy here - it's a solemn occasion. The scene is fantastically scripted, directed and acted, especially by Kelley.Mention should also be made of guest star Lovsky as the high muckety-muck Vulcan priestess - talk about perfect casting. Her accent makes it seem as if she was born to play this role. She utters several words in the Vulcan language and it all rings true. The entire atmosphere on Vulcan, with the decor, the costumes and the Vulcans themselves was never done better (unfortunately). In fact, future Trek series, even TNG, and especially the ""Enterprise"" show, were never able to capture that terrific exotic feel which we're able to immerse ourselves in during this sequence. These REALLY were Vulcans, not just some actors with strange pointed ears attached. Only actor Mark Lenard was also able to capture that authentic Vulcan sensibility later in this 2nd season, in ""Journey to Babel."" That episode also explained, more or less, as to why Spock's parents didn't attend this Vulcan marriage ceremony. Ah, poor Spock - at least you chose your friends well.",9

In the first, Kirk knows that Spock will die if they don't reach Vulcan in eight days. However, despite his pleas to Starfleet Command, he is told to proceed to Altair VI to be part of an inauguration ritual. With McCoy when told this, McCoy remarks ""Well, that's that."" Kirk however has no intention of following orders and tells McCoy he will continue to Vulcan. McCoy tells him this will mean his career. Kirk replies, ""Spock has saved my life at least a dozen times. Isn't that worth a career?"", then looks straight at McCoy and says, ""He's my FRIEND."" A great line, maybe the best of the original series.Second is when McCoy, Spock and Kirk are all in the turbobay, and Spock asks Kirk if he will accompany him. Kirk ask if it is permitted, and Spock says that it is ""my right, to be accompanied by my closed friends."" He then says slowly, ""I also.. request... McCoy."" McCoy, understanding the respect Spock has shown him and much pleased, says ""I shall be honored, sir."" These are great moments in television, ones that cemented Star Trek as being more than just science fiction, but about the human condition. I've watched these scenes over and over and still get a thrill watching them. Great art, great story, great direction, great direction.",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Amok Time (TV Episode 1967)",wonderful show,"Season 2 of Star Trek started off with a bang. This is one of the most memorable shows concerning Spock and his home planet of Vulcan. Plus the Vulcan's 7 year biological urge to mate. Only Harlan Ellison's ""City on the Edge of Forever"" exceeds the quality of Theodore Sturgeon's script here. It must surely rank among the Top 10 Star Trek shows that were ever produced.We see Spock and Kirk fighting at the end and Spock is almost out of his mind since he is in the throws of Ponn Far--the Vulcan mating ritual. Who can forget Spock's poignant speech to Tpau that he shall not live long and prosper since he has killed his captain and his friend, Kirk.",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Amok Time (TV Episode 1967)","""... there are some things which transcend even the discipline of the service"".","THIS is what great science fiction is all about! The second season of the series kicks off with an entirely original story that explores Spock's Vulcan roots, and delves into that planet's ritual and customs that have grown shrouded in antiquity. I just love the way the writers (Roddenberry and Sturgeon) develop the concept of Pon Farr, the time of mating, and use it to create havoc with Spock's rational side. There's a uniquely creative element at work in the naming of the characters, the revelation of Vulcan as a red sky planet, the history of T'Pau, the beauty of T'Pring and the challenge of the Kal-if-fee. And if that wasn't enough, you have your first genuine 'Holy ____' moment in the history of Star Trek - Captain Kirk dies! That comes so totally out of left field that you're left wondering how this can possibly be happening to one of TV's favorite characters.Even after forty plus years this episode performs it's magic for me. Not only does it work as extraordinary sci-fi, there's also the bond that's developed between Kirk, Spock and McCoy that sets the stage for a friendship that really didn't exist in the series before. Most of the time in the first season, their relationship was developed along strictly professional lines, with boundaries drawn along status and rank. Here those lines are blurred when Spock invites his fellow officers to witness the Koon-ut-kal-if-fee, and is given even more approbation when T'Pau honors Spock's choice.What further magnifies this episode as one of the best are those elements written into the story that wouldn't have been missed if they were left out, but since they were included, work to create an even richer tapestry for the Star Trek universe. Here I'm thinking about T'Pau's renown as the only person ever to decline a seat on the Federation Council. With that simple description, Roddenberry elevates the character's status in the ST universe in a way that might otherwise have taken a couple of episodes to impress.And of course there's T'Pring's rationale for the Kal-if-fee. I always got a kick out of the way Star Trek presented those situations that worked to reinforce logic and reason to effect an outcome. This one was brilliant, pitting Kirk as T'Pring's champion against a Spock who even if he emerged victorious, would have left T'Pring with her own desired outcome. All of these elements work so well in the story, that every time I watch it, I'm left speechless as an Aldebaran Shellmouth.",10
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Amok Time (TV Episode 1967)",Star Trek: The Original Series - Amok Time,"While ""Spock's Brain"" might be a rotgut to the third season in regards to its storytelling, ""Amok Time"" more than makes up for it. Getting the chance to explore the Vulcan mating rituals, visit Spock's home planet, and see Kirk forced to combat his friend ""to the death"" are all surefire reasons this is a classic episode for the Enterprise's Chief Science Officer. Spock going through a peculiar type of puberty, his blood ""burning"", his emotional and biological state infuriated by Vulcan physiology and the ritual resulting in his chosen mate deciding she wants him to ""fight for her""; there are fascinating developments shown to Star Trek fans for the first time. It is clear his chosen mate, T'Pring (Arlene Martel), has eyes and heart for Vulcan, Stonn (Lawrence Montaigne). So T'Pring goes the ""logical"" route and chooses Kirk as the other participant to vie for her hand in marriage. T'Pau (Celia Lovsky) as the marriage ""moderator"" with the authority most respected by not just Vulcan but the Federation. Spock's value and recognition has brought great fame, but T'Pring has a desire for a Vulcan at home with her. Meanwhile poor Kirk, who had accepted the challenge because of respect for T'Pau, wanting to represent the Federation and his species well, didn't realize the combat would be to the death, unable to back out! That alone brings plenty of suspense to the ongoing plot. While Spock fights the ""blood fever"" and, this drive that is more primal instinct than logic, Kirk is pretty much completely on the defensive, not only combating a stronger and superior fighter but the thin atmospheric air deteriorating his strength and conditioning. Even before arriving on Vulcan, there is the development of Spock's health, the warfare inside him raging, with Nurse Chapel, long established as the woman who loves him, making some soup for him that is tossed at her when his temper was uncontrollable! Kirk appealing to Spock to share what is burdening him and why he so badly needs to go on shore leave to Vulcan, while Starfleet Command orders the captain to instead travel on a diplomatic mission to Altair IV provide other unique developments serving as proper connective tissue to the final act. Bones' clever answer as to how to get Kirk out of such a hot mess and how Spock realizes ""Jim"" isn't dead, his face and voice so overjoyed just bookend this great episode nicely. The show always found ways to innovatively ""kill"" and ""resurrect"" James T Kirk.",10

It's also full of firsts. It the first episode to feature Walter Koenig as Chekov, the first to bill DeForest Kelley alongside Shatner and Nimoy in the opening credits, and perhaps most importantly, the first to feature Gerald Fried's iconic ""battle music"".As for the episode itself, it's very tight and tense, with a strong performance by Nimoy, who clearly relished the juicy role and a chance to see another side of the otherwise cool and logical Spock.",9
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Amok Time (TV Episode 1967)","Funny, This Never Came Up Before","This is a good episode. The series was renewed for another year and began with a very original tale. Spock's physiology demands that every seven years he must mate. This requires a trip to Vulcan. When Spock and his crew mates arrive, it becomes obvious that Spock must be a very important figure because he is in the presence of the matriarch ruler, T'Pau. Unfortunately, his trip proves a difficult one in that his betrothed has decided, according to Vulcan law, to choose a different mate. She also has the privilege of choosing someone to fight for her. Instead of choosing a Vulcan hero, she picks Kirk. It is required that he fight to the death, which proves to be a no-win situation. Kirk is doomed to failure because he has no experience in this type of fighting. The interesting things about this episode are, first of all, the lack of knowledge of Vulcans and their habits. Since Spock is a major figure in Starfleet, why isn't this known. The other is the utter unfairness of the situation. As we learn more about Vulcans, we come to realize that many of their traditions are grounded in a time before they became the stoic people we are used to. The other thing has to do with the conclusion, which I will withhold. It concludes with one of McCoy's best responses to Spock. Watch this episode just for this.",9
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Amok Time (TV Episode 1967)",Good episode but could have been better,"I recently re-watched this episode on Blu-Ray, having seen it many times growing up. The basic premise is that Spock is going through the Vulcan ""pon farr"" mating ritual which strips away his logic and requires that he return to Vulcan. Spock is extremely reluctant to talk about it, but Kirk and McCoy rise to the situation and support him admirably, as does Nurse Chapel. Spock's supposed Vulcan bride-to-be, however, pulls a fairly dirty trick on him, and disaster is only averted by a clever maneuver by McCoy.I thought the first half or so of this episode was fantastic-- interesting and dramatic conflict-- trying to figure out why Spock was acting so uncharacteristically. Spock's profound desire to keep the matter secret. Kirk rising to the occasion and supporting his friend without betraying his confidences. McCoy being a decent supporting guy rather than the annoying nag that he sometimes can be around Spock.However, I thought the latter part, when the Enterprise finally reached Vulcan, could have been better. I found T'Pau highly annoying-- her stupid use of ""thee"" and ""thy"" instead of ""you"" and ""your"" was irritating and pretentious to me, and her insistence on strict adherence to ritual didn't seem fitting for a Vulcan, let alone the Vulcan leader. I also quite disliked the dirty trick pulled by Spock's potential bride, which was a pretty ugly and dishonorable maneuver for a Vulcan to make, and which seemed to suggest that Vulcan women are devious vixens. I also found it odd that Spock was relatively ineffective in combat here against Kirk for the most part after beating the tar out of him in ""This Side of Paradise"".Still, the episode had a neat resolution due to McCoy's quick thinking, so it worked out okay at the end. But I would have preferred a second act that didn't involve such unseemly behavior by the Vulcan women.As a minor point of trivia, this episode introduces Chekov (Walter Koenig).",8

10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Amok Time (TV Episode 1967)",Guilty pleasure,"Love this episode. The Mr Spock we have come to know and sort of understand is really not himself. He is apparently too embarrassed to tell the Captain that he is undergoing a sex- drive induced behavioral aberration, something the average male human has every time he consumes more than one beer. We soon learn, for the Vulcan, it only happens every 7 years. Apparently that fact cannot simply be pulled up on the ship's computers, as mystery shrouds the ancient mating ritual. The Captain cannot grasp why Spock would suddenly demand to use his leave credits in an illogical manner, and confronts his beloved First Officer.Upon learning the truth, Kirk disobeys Starfleet orders out of friendship.Mr Spock has saved his life countless times and it is worth losing his career. Thus the ship is diverted to Vulcan to save Mr Spock's life. Soon Kirk and McCoy beam down to Vulcan with Spock, thinking they are about to be be his ""best men"" at the wedding ceremony. We see Vulcan culture for the first time, and a dramatic fight between Spock and Kirk ensues. Kirk almost dies but McCoy cleverly saves the day.This is a great episode. It has all the elements we have come to love in TOS, plus Mr Spock going berserk. We have Nurse Chapel, with her long and skinny legs, falling over to help Spock, and we have Mr Spock too ashamed to tell the Captain about the biologic functions of Vulcans. Somehow, the episode conveniently ends with no imperative to actually consummate a marital relationship, and Mr Spock is off the hook for another 7 years. The only downside to this episode is the ludicrously incorrect use of thee's and thou's by the female Vulcan official. Why they thought this would sound good is a great mystery.The episode ends with a poignant affirmation of Mr Spock's love for the Captain. His joy is genuine in discovering he has not killed Kirk, after all. And all the female fans then went into hibernation, as he apparently will not be in the mood again for 7 years, which is an eternity when you are a lonely teenager.",9

Also, Nurse Chapel's unrequited love for Spock is handled succinctly, yet beautifully. Watch the associated- scenes and see the actual humanity Spock exhibit towards Christine in them, affirming some feelings of his own towards her. No protracted Kirk love interest (Lust in Space) in this one, perhaps producing alien- hybrid progeny throughout the galaxy! ""Amok Time"" is a treat for all those that love this show. Sure, there's the usual plot contrivance where the prerequisite fight must occur (the fight theme music is now so humorously-recognized) just like other television programs of the era did, but it is handled in the Trekkian context we have grown to appreciate, as fans. This is an episode I have learned to really enjoy more, over time. Watch it carefully as a fan, and you just might, as well.",10

He explains that his wife was chosen for him when he was a child and now he must return to her; if he doesn't he will die! Star Fleet has ordered the Enterprise to go to Altair VI but Kirk diverts for his friend. When they arrive at Vulcan they learn that the woman Spock had been promised to doesn't want to be paired with him; as part of the ritual she can choose another who will fight to the death with Spock she chooses Captain Kirk meaning the two friends must fight and Spock's condition means he won't hold back from killing Kirk!This episode is a great introduction to the second season; we have a fine story that tells us more about Vulcan culture and teaches us that they do have times when they lose their famed logic. It also sets up a conflict that looks as though it must end in the death of either Kirk or Spock obviously watching now we know that somehow they will both survive but that doesn't make it any less exciting. The final resolution is nicely handled as is Spock's intended's explanation of why she picked Kirk to fight for her. Leonard Nimoy does a fine job showing us the emotional conflict Spock is going through as he tells his friend Kirk the Vulcans' deepest secret. The episode also serves to introduce Ensign Pavel Chekov to the show; although at this point there is no way to tell him apart from other single episode characters; he certainly doesn't play a large role in the story.

It's one of the very best of TOL b&w series and I was completely taken by Arlene's fine work as the simple, likely Hispanic, cleaning woman. She's given good material that allows her emotion, dignity and decision; unusual for that TV era for a Hispanic part (including today?). It's a good script for Culp as well and a modern movie on the same script would be a great thing... if modern writers suppressed their mania to make everything explode and replace real looking people with tall skinny models (q.v.: the recent Star Trek movies by Wheeden where ALL the main cast are the same 5'10"" and could be from the same frat house. PLEASE go back to making your good stuff, like Firefly, Joss!).Anyways, I decided to look up Arlene Martel today of IMBD and, to my very happy surprise, find she's not only enjoyed a long career as character actress in some of my fave TV shows (The Fugitive, Star Trek, Hogan's Heroes, etc), but she played one of my fave ST-TOS roles of all time as T'Pring. I had no idea it was the same lady as in TOL. Yes, there could've been more lines, but she got some great ones. In the ""Why choose Staan over me..."" scene, she's utterly perfectly logical, her delivery a 10.An even bigger surprise for me... same age as my dad! Unfortunately, Arlene died in 2014.

Many confusing Vulcan traditions stun the Earthlings and T'Pring ends up forcing a battle to the death between Spock and the perplexed Kirk. Spock has a full on fever of blood and is no longer himself. The stately T'Pau presides over the entire process. After a long and exciting battle sequence, it appears that Spock has won, Kirk appears dead. Bones transports up the body and Spock asks to turn himself in, no longer under the spell of Pon Farr and now uninterested in T'Pring after learning that this entire gimmick was because she wants to marry a third man. It's revealed that Bones drugged Kirk to make him appear dead, everyone's now fine. The Enterprise heads off again for the stars. Thus episode really captures the essence of Vulcan and the customs of its people. I love all the traditions, weapons, and backdrop. Nimoy does a fantastic job in this episode showing off a wide range of emotion, something normally not asked of him. It's a bit odd that both McCoy and Kirk are unaware of the concept of Pon Farr. The humans has been interacting with Vulcans for a very long time by now so the fact that this is a heavily guarded secret is strange. Heck, we even see it occur aboard the Enterprise with T'Pol over 100 years before! Vulcans and humans have married. How has this not come up?Regardless of this giant plothole, I still really like this episode. It's very Spock-focused which is always a plus in my book. I also like how Kirk accepted the dual before learning all the rules. That's a classic headstrong Kirk move. I enjoyed seeing the old sage, TPau.

In the meantime, Spock becomes a raving maniac who will die unless he is given shore leave for some nookie. But, the Enterprise is ordered to some other quadrant--and Kirk incorrectly assumes Spock will just get over it. Well, McCoy informs Jim that unless Spock is on Vulcan ASAP, he will die!!! So, Kirk defies direct orders and heads there (something that it seems is quite okay to do judging by the various episodes).Once on the planet, Spock's intended turns out to be a real piece of work and initiates a fight to the death between Kirk and Spock.

Prior to this time the common hall was the scene of all activity. Once private apartments came into being, the social network of the communal hearth that was the heart of village and castle had had a spike driven into its chest.Social contact, already codified from the classic era, was put into an even greater diaspora than before. From this, and from the fear of spreading germs and sickness, social codes became more tight fisted. Up until the point where affection between man and woman could barely be tolerated.""Amok Time"" deals with this theme. It deals with the veils mankind has created to hide and mask, for better or ill, our more basic physical and emotional desires. The creation of a mysticism by a race driven by logic to enshroud the act and craving for simple love shows that the more a society represses said feelings, the more dangerous the contest and higher the stakes.The episode goes even deeper than that (but only just) as it examines the estrangement of arranged marriages by a traditional society, and the lengths the parties involved will go to to alter the bargain made in which they had no say. Friend becomes foe in an emotional feast that culminates in some very gripping and dramatic television.The episode also calls into question the sanity of repressing basic emotions, and the tragic consequences thereof. We witness the strains it puts on the crew of the Enterprise, and some unexpected repercussions, and even more repercussions beyond that.An interesting episode that may have been done partially for sensationalism as well as social commentary.

This episode's theme is also one of the most known in TV history and have been parodied several times.This is one of the few episodes where Spock start acting irrational, and un-Vulcan like. This time because it's apparently the Vulcan mating season. Or his mating season for that sake. Spock has to return to Vulcan to rejoin his wife or he'll die. The the cleverest episode plot they've mad, but still an interesting story.The reason this episode is so popular among fans is because of the famous fight between Spock and Kirk. A slightly cheesy and dated action sequence, but not bad at all. In my opinion it's pretty good for it's time, and it beats the Gorn fight (I don't dislike it, but it more fun than serious).I never really get tired of this episode, and it introduces some many things which now are essential part of the Star Trek franchise.

She chooses a visiting William Shatner to be her champion in a Vulcanian blood duel that Spock is required to fight. As we learn in the end Martel is as ruthlessly logical as Spock is, maybe more so.

Insubordination and mood swings aren't applicable to our favorite Vulcan at all, but here he is completely out of his mind.It's a great way to build drama and flesh out the character.

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. Unlike any other hit series, it only has 3 seasons so luckily it means that they will be covering up all their ideas within it until they are satisfied. As it often happens, the first season is always promising and has potential (or else it won't lift up for further more seasons) in it and is utilized with fine detailed work like focusing on different new breeds and characters bonding through this journey.A new intake on Spock and his culture and a peek on his biological life too along with two friends fighting against each other all of this is in Amok Time which raises the question who would not like this episode?

(TV Episode 1967)","They've Outgrown You, Apollo","The supposition created here, a natural for science fiction writers, is that the famed Greek gods of myth - Zeus, Hera, Apollo, Artemis, Hermes & so on - were actually space travelers whose advanced powers made them seem like gods to the ancient peoples of Earth 5000 years ago (hey, I wonder if Jack Kirby, creator of 'The Eternals' comic book for Marvel Comics, was familiar with this episode). Now the Enterprise comes across the last of these - Apollo - on an otherwise ordinary planet. The other so-called gods have long since faded away. Most of these points in the story are not really explained; why do these beings thrive on worship? Are they shapeshifters, absorbing such emotions the same way we humans take in normal food? Instead, we are offered only hints, such as an extra organ inside Apollo detected by McCoy which is never elaborated on. This may be lazy writing or just a way of keeping some remaining mystery and awe around such a mythological character. In any case, the theme reveals itself as the age-old conflict between modern technology, which offers comfortable existence, and the more naturalistic gadget-free lifestyle we humans have left behind, or lost, in Apollo's view.Returning to nature was a rising, popular theme during the sixties and seventies. Many began to feel that we were advancing too quickly, creating an abnormal culture, as a result. The super-alien Apollo certainly feels this way and offers the alternative; Kirk rejects this outright - he has his mission, as well as a ship, which Apollo makes the mistake of threatening to crush. Of the 5-person landing party, the one female member does give in, temporarily, to this proposition; perhaps she represents the 20% of our population who have serious doubts about our progress. Ironically, Kirk has to remind her of her humanity, her true heritage, to turn her back to the majority. We're stuck with what we have, this seems to say, not to mention, 'you will have no other gods before me.' The powerful Apollo, a more sympathetic version of the sadistic Trelane of the 1st season (""The Squire of Gothos""), truly has no harmful intent - he sees himself as very benevolent. This is his undoing, for he also proves to be quite naive - perhaps the clueless teenager to Trelane's spoiled brat - and, like the most vulnerable among us, he leaves himself open to heartbreak. No matter your powers - in matters of the heart, which Kirk chooses to exploit as that one weakness he usually finds in superpowerful threats, you may end up helpless. It's unusual to see such a powerful being weeping like a lost boy, a genuinely sad note to end things on. Kirk - destroyer of gods, another notch on his resume.",7
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Who Mourns for Adonais? (TV Episode 1967)",There is more depth to this episode that there appears at first glance.,"Kirk and his crew are waylaid by a powerful alien who claims to be the ancient Greek god Apollo. Apollo demands they abandon their ship and become his worshipers like the Greeks of old Earth had been, and Apollo is not taking no for an answer. Kirk and Co. have to figure out how to escape his clutches without falling victim to his extraordinary powers and his violent temper.At first glance, this seems like a too-goofy premise. They encounter a Greek god replete with laurels on his head living on a planet replete with marble temple and statues. It seems like something out of Lost In Space. But closer examination reveals a deep, meaningful character study of a being who is either unwilling or unable to accept that the world has left him behind.Apollo, wonderfully and sympathetically played by guest star Michael Forest, is a powerful creature who masqueraded as a God on ancient Earth and obviously thinks it is his right and duty to continue to serve as a God to Earthmen. And at one point in the dialogue he indicates that his kind, of which he seems to be the last, need worship and attention. Perhaps it is a form of sustenance for them, or maybe Apollo just has a deep-seated neediness, it's never clarified. Either way, it is an important feature of what drives him. Another fascinating part of his character is shown when he suggests he disapproves of the clinical, dispassionate creatures he might think Earthmen are becoming as they continue to learn about the universe: to him, they have lost their passion and character as they have grown in power. And it seems his interpretation of reality is different from that of the Earth men, although at one point in the dialogue he seems to suggest he knew his God status was always just a masquerade. But finally, it's clear Apollo really believes he is doing the right thing by Kirk and Co.When he is finally defeated, his sense of hurt, his broken-heartedness, and his sense that all that he looked forward to and believed in are destroyed, is genuinely affecting. You understand why he commits suicide at the end, and I for one felt sorry for him. He never meant any harm.Also this is the episode where Walter Koenig gets to be vintage Chekov: irreverent, effusive, but very capable.The thing that keeps the episode out of superb territory is that the premise, although it sets up such a good character study, is still unavoidably just a little on the goofy side, but that should not stop you from enjoying it, and should not stop you from feeling sorry for Apollo at the end, just like Kirk and McCoy did.",7
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Who Mourns for Adonais? (TV Episode 1967)",My Favorite TOS episode,"Spoilers ahead.....Just my opinion. I loved ""Who Mourns For Adonais?"" because of the story and because it involved the entire ensemble. It gave everyone something to do, showed the hierarchy of the command, as well as the camaraderie of the crew.I enjoyed Leslie Parrish and Michael Forest as a guest stars and the concept of Apollo and the Greek Gods being real beings was very intriguing to me.The idea that Lt. Palomas would be captivated meeting a man of her dreams and vocation was realistic and the frightful rape scene was groundbreaking on TV. And the concept that her dream man would seek such retribution on one whom adores him was intense.Then there's the dichotomy of the Trek crew and ship being trapped by these beings and trying to respect their different culture, but ultimately destroying the last of the alien's kind was riveting. The episode had great special effects, involvement of ship and crew plus the ""monster"" plus a classy story that made the viewer think. There was something - so Trek - about the lighting, the colors, etc that also was captivating.The lines of dialog throughout were really choice and so well represented the established characters. The sorrow of Apollo was so great and well acted. And lastly, the line from Kirk of ""Would it have hurt us, I wonder, to have gathered just a few laurel leaves? Fabulous.",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Who Mourns for Adonais? (TV Episode 1967)",Mourning for a lost god?,"I think there is more symbolism in this episode than is normally acknowledged or commented upon. That they choose Apollo as the particular Greek god to meet somewhere out in space, apparently as if he had been waiting millenia for the earth creatures that resemble himself to develop spacefaring technology and eventually find him... while in reality, after millenia of looking at the night sky, naming the stars and planets, telling our seasons by them, and thinking up fables and superstititions about them, the program to actually land and walk on another world happened to be the Apollo Moon Program. And the moon, only feasibly reachable within the recent decades before it was actually done, and once thought a god 'himself' by many cultures, proved reachable, after all, without any god. So, as we were to soon reach what was thought a god, it was in fact not a god, nor was a god's help needed; it was pure applied science. And knowing Roddenberry was an agnostic, perhaps an atheist, the point is clear: there are powers and forces in the universe, but it was humans that invented the god hypothesis to explain them on the elementary level, and this hypothesis can be destroyed, and that will be one facet of our scientific legacy. But the god he really had in mind, of course, was not the loyal friend of (loser) Hector of Troy, but the God most of the western world eventually turned to, originally of the ancient Hebrews. He is not necessarily saying that that God (or his race of beings) may be found some day as having been Wizard of Oz type ""humbugs,"" but it is at least such a thought experiment to that effect.As for Apollo being a potential tragedy (slavery; everlasting indebtedness in the episode) we would have to deal with... this episode (and presumably its inception) came a few months after the launch pad fire of Apollo 1. The moon program, as is well known, had progressive success in the early and mid 60's and became overconfident and began to 'move too fast;' that is, too fast for safety in order to meet the deadline of landing on the moon before the decade was over. And in hindsight, many historians look back and say a disaster was inevitable. To phrase it in correspondence with the episode-- If we don't get Apollo under our control, Apollo will ruin us; even if we destroy the 'end of the decade' objective, we must get a grip on Apollo, and we cannot place ourselves forever in debt to 'him.' I think the above 2 paragraphs are more of what ST was attempting to say, rather than anything in particular about the ancient astronaut theory, though that certainly was around at that time, just before Erich Von Daniken published his first book. Indeed, the 'getting back to nature' theme was more pronounced, but with the addition of ""not because we are being forced to."" There was a movement, of course, at that time of getting away from the unfriendliness, the pollution, the overly-mechanized cities, and living more in harmony with nature. Hippie communes, 'bedroom communities' with homes on large tracts, time-share getaways, et al, were manifestations of this idea. And shows like Green Acres parodied the idea. Perhaps ""Who Speaks for Adonais?"" was also another angle of parody of ""away from mechanization; back to nature,"" or ""weren't the ancients lucky to have no other way?"" (the answer being obvious).",
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Who Mourns for Adonais? (TV Episode 1967)","""A god cannot survive as a memory"".","I don't know why, but the title of this episode manages to bug me a bit. Adonis was a god of Greek mythology, but spelled without the second 'a', and when all is said and done, Adonis doesn't have anything to do with the story. Oh well, maybe it's just me.You have here another of those 'promise of eternal joy' stories that Star Trek managed to bring to the screen often enough in the prior season, 'This Side of Paradise' being the most familiar. All the character Apollo (Michael Forest) requires is that the crew of the Enterprise offer him the undivided adoration he so richly deserves. You just know this isn't going to sit well with the Captain.What intrigued me with the story was the notion that Greek mythology might have been inspired by visitors from alien planets five thousand years ago. That was a rather unique way of looking at it, although I think I've heard that theory advanced by UFO enthusiasts before. Interesting to speculate as far as it goes, but how would we ever know?Walter Koening made his Star Trek debut as Enterprise navigator Chekov in the second season opener 'Amok Time' and has a slightly larger role here upon which he would continue to build. I didn't notice it as much in the prior story, but he's really got that Beatle look going for him in this one.",7
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Who Mourns for Adonais? (TV Episode 1967)",All hands on deck,"This is all in all a pretty good episode. All members of the original cast appear in this episode and a couple have pretty good roles. I always enjoy when Checkov has some lines as he is a solid contributor and he is intergral in this episode. Scotty is prominent as well but is a bit on the annoying side as he not using good judgement.The Greek god Apollo is the foil in this gem and Kirk and company eventually break him down and defeat him. Nice build up on what made the Greek gods tick and how they eventually died off with only Apollo holding up hope that his minions would eventually return.In the end, the combined efforts of Kirk and landing party on the planet and Spock back on the Enterprise working independently to sort out the challenge and prevail.",8
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Who Mourns for Adonais? (TV Episode 1967)",Welcome to Olympus Captain Kirk,"Season 2, episode 2. The Enterprise encounters a very large hand made of pure energy. This hand stops the ship dead in it's tracks. Apollo appears on the viewing screen and demands Kirk and crew to come down to the planet.. all but Spock whom he claims reminds him too much of Pan. Kirk, McCoy, Scotty, Chekov and Carolyn beams down to met Apollo. Apollo wants Kirk and crew to worship him and uses his powers to stop them from communicating with the ship & using their phasers. Kirk theorizes ""what if he really is Apollo?"" Apollo is taken by Carolyn and willing to open up to her some. The men are working on who or what Apollo is and how to communicate with the ship. Kirk and crew must find away to deal with Apollo and go on to their next adventure.Not too bad of a story... kinda interesting where Greek mythology meets science fiction fun.7/10",7
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Who Mourns for Adonais? (TV Episode 1967)",Major Historical Misrepresentation,"Ugh...this episode gets under my skin. It's historical misrepresentation encapsulates well the ignorance and hubris of our generation. This episode can be summarized by paraphrasing Kirk: ""Apollo wants us to herd sheep mindlessly and worship him like the ancient Greeks did, but we won't do it because we have outgrown that life. We are now scientists!"" The problem with this conceptions is that ancient Greeks were not dumb hicks mindlessly herding sheep and hating science. The ancient Greeks formed the most sophisticated civilization outside of the modern era! They essentially invented science. Archimedes invented more successful machines than the average modern scientist could ever dream of building. Plato established political science. In High Schools today, we still learn about Pythagorus' theorem, Euclid's geometry, and Archimedes' principle. In fact, the first few years of a modern High School curriculum could be labeled ""Grappling with what the Greeks mastered thousands of years ago."" The ancient Greeks were ambitious, bright, and critical thinkers. So why did they love their polytheistic myths so much if they weren't so simple minded? For the same reason people love Star Trek so much: myths are fun and often thought-provoking. This episode says more about the ignorance of the modern television audience than it does about the ignorance of the Greeks. Go read a non-fiction book sometime. The world is very different from what popular entertainment portrays.",
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Who Mourns for Adonais? (TV Episode 1967)","Neat idea, terrible execution","The idea of gods actually being ancient aliens is something that has fascinated science fiction authors for many years. A pity then, that this episode falls victim to a bad script with cast members acting out of character, dull scenes that serve little purpose and excessive sexist dialogue. Scotty is a complete moron in this episode, and we're supposed to believe it's because he's in love with a lieutenant we've never seen before this episode. If he wasn't a main character Kirk would have court-martialed him for his disobedience and idiocy. Furthermore, every character is useless to the plot except for Kirk and that archaeologist chick, whatshername. Apollo is as one-dimensional as villains come, and does nothing but spout the same boring garbage over and over again, and no one thinks to use reason to persuade him until the last few minutes. They spend the episode mocking him and threatening him with their powerful weapons, even long after he's proved they are virtually useless against him.Very rarely are the Enterprise crew shown as being so incompetent, almost to the point of being mentally handicapped. If this had been the first Star Trek episode I ever saw, I'd be wondering why anyone let these fools out of the house, let alone on a Federation starship. Of course, the blatant sexism in such comments as ""one day she'll meet a man and resign her commission"" which implies women cannot be married and keep their careers doesn't help. I realize this was the 60's, but c'mon. Do you have to be so obvious? The worst part though was Kirk's comment about ""only needing one God"" which implies monotheistic religion is somehow superior to Greek polytheism, a rather close-minded sentiment for someone from the 23rd century. Considering the point of the episode is outgrowing the need for gods, why would he make such a comment? So we've outgrown Apollo but not the Abrahamic God? Silly.All in all, it's garbage. Without a doubt the worst episode of the second season.",1
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Who Mourns for Adonais? (TV Episode 1967)",Great episode,"I thought this was one of the best episodes of the series. Thought-provoking, very well-written, and well-paced, with a nice balance of attention paid to the various performers.The premise is that the Greek gods were human-like aliens of an advanced race that encountered Earthlings some 5000 years ago, in ancient Greece, and formed the basis of Greek mythology. The dilemma here is that Apollo, the last of his kind, has seized control of the Enterprise and demands that the crew stay and worship him; in return, he will provide for their needs. Kirk, correctly realizing that slavery is not a viable option, searches for ways to break free.Some really great writing here. The speech that Kirk gives to Carolyn was brilliant, I thought. A great piece of rhetoric that is strongly moving, and is potent enough to induce her to betray her heart and act for the good of her fellow humans. Spock was in fine form here as well, doing what he could under the circumstances. Carolyn's betrayal of Apollo was sadly necessary to distract him long enough for the Enterprise to effect an escape.Bittersweet ending, too. Kirk, though realizing he really no had no choice, nevertheless feels sympathy and regret for Apollo.A few minor complaints prevent me from giving this a 10/10 rating; mostly, the many unanswered questions: why would an advanced race of aliens crave worship so badly? How exactly are they 'immortal' if their anatomy seems largely the same as normal humans? How exactly did Apollo ""spread himself on the wind"" at the end, considering his power source was gone?But these are minor quibbles. These are the kinds of questions that could scarcely be dealt with in a weekly television show. Even at 50 minutes, this episode was paced very tightly, I thought, with nary a dragging moment. Kirk and Spock confront their dilemma head on, and, together, work out a way to extricate themselves. Good performance also by Walter Koenig as Chekov, and even of minor background characters like Mr. Kyle. Apollo was well developed as a sympathetic figure. Yet, Kirk was quite right: bending knee to a powerful being for the rest of their lives was not a desirable outcome.",9
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Who Mourns for Adonais? (TV Episode 1967)",Gilbert Ralston had a big hand in this.,"I've just watched this for the first time as an adult- pretty sure I wouldn't have found it too interesting in the eighties as a child, so it seems like the actual first time seeing it. I also don't remember being so distracted by Chekov's wig, which from some angles unfortunately looks like a headless chicken nesting on his head.The remastered effects are done nicely in my view, not overdone- thankfully they don't seem to have done a ""Lucas"" on any of the episodes I've seen so far. The hand force-field effect would have been considered a bit corny back in the sixties even, but I guess it's making a statement of some sort - The God Apollo able to grapple a whole spaceship in the fingers of his hand.The writer Gilbert Ralston has done a good job I think, considering at the time, he was writing for children's show Gentle Ben (a nice little connection, Clint Howard was in the more highly-acclaimed episode ""The Corbomite Maneuver"" as the Tranya-drinking Balok).Anyway, I won't give away much, but it's the idea that mythological Gods were real, in human form and demanded worship from us mere mortals, plus maybe steal our girlfriend in the process. Is he really who he says he is, or just a lyre? (one for Greek myth fans) But, as perhaps expected, this ""God"" certainly turns out to be more ""myth- illogical"". Incidentally, this episode is a little Spock-light as he's stuck on the seized ship giving orders, but Kirk gives us some marvellous full-on Shatnerisms. A few nice lines from McCoy as usual, especially his almost affectionate utterance of one of Spock's favourite words. Fascinating, and I'd give it an 8/10.",8
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Who Mourns for Adonais? (TV Episode 1967)",Did they really have to destroy Apollo?,"Having just seen this episode again after having first seen it when I was a teenager my first impression is still the same today (4 August 2006) as it was back in the early seventies when ST (TOS) first reached the UK. I was really upset that they had to resort to destroying Apollo. I note that Dr McCoy was of the same opinion.My version of the story would have had Kirk, instead of antagonising Apollo at every step, trying to befriend him somewhat and trying to dissuade Apollo (or perhaps re-educate would be a better word in the context of the episode). This may have worked after quite a lot of effort after all being in the position of thinking of oneself as a god is quite a height to be let down from. Eventually, of course, the storyline may have evolved so that re-education may not have worked for some reason, thus the course of action as followed in the ST episode could have been played out as seen.On the other hand, perhaps the extra story I'm thinking of may have made the episode too long and would have had to have been excised to fit the time slot. Who knows?I note that the actor who played Lt. Kyle in this episode also played Commander Kyle in The Wrath of Kahn.Finally, When I saw this episode again tonight, I too noticed the line where Kirk says to Apollo ""Mankind has no need for gods"". However, if I were the writer, I would simply have left it at that. Enough said.",6
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Who Mourns for Adonais? (TV Episode 1967)",Some fairly deep stuff.,"Alright, where to start. We have on the surface a pretty standard sci- fi theme of old-historic power meets modern man. The two meet and things happen.We've got this highly self centered and egotistical (and I should add abusive) ""god"" from Earth's past wanting adoration just like the olden days. But the days of mans' ""oohing"" and ""ahhing"" over things like fire, storms and earthquakes are over. Man is the master of his domain (the odd Klingon not withstanding), and needs little for super natural beings to interfere in his life.But Apollo has other plans.What strikes me as being interesting about this episode is a notion that the author brought up. The notion that we, mankind, have this primitive nature within us, but that we grow beyond it as we mature. Apollo, as another reviewer stated, is in this essence an immature teenage boy. He's an adolescent with lots of power. So much power that he can stop one of starfleet's finest vessels cold in space.The story comments on man's primitive instincts and base desires. They're a foundation for a lot of what human's have achieved, but in the end they're only the foundation, and not the higher modes of thought we use in everyday life. Apollo uses his classical Greek god status and powers to try to win over the higher social circle that is the personnel of Starfleet command. He has temporary success, but must ultimately be brought down lest the rest of the Federation see/hear/read about the Enterprise not returning from a mission.In this way you could use this episode as an allegory for a lot of man's ills, and a lot of history we as humans have created for ourselves because of our inner Apollo. Though the truth is that even though we recognize all those negative or over-energetic and unregulated aspects within ourselves, we still have Apollo-like moments. The key is to not let our inner Apollo over come our inner Kirk :-)The times being what they were we have a Russian in the episode in the form of Chekov. Scotty, for whatever reason, has beamed down completing the usual ""Let's send the ship's senior staff to the planet"" motif that seems to be in nearly all Trek episodes. But hey, we wouldn't have a show or story if that didn't happen.If I had a gripe with this installment of Trek it's that the thing wasn't shot outdoors. It's got that ever oh-so Trek artificiality when it comes to alien planetscapes shot on a stage. Which is too bad because this would have been perfect if Desilu could have found an old Steve Reeves' gladiator set, and had it double for an ancient Greek god oracle. Then again who knows? Anyway, that's how I would've shot it :- )In any event, give it a whirl. It should entertain.*EDIT* Hmm, interesting; apparently some of this applies to myself: An egotistical self-centered ""god"", prone to mood sways and high opinions of his worth than he actually is, has caused some mischief and problems for the traffic ways in the UFP. However, the difference is that for Trek's Apollo, his treatment was forced. Mine was voluntary, and now I've got some sort of plot to get me to ""fairer pastures""; note; not greener, but something more suitable? Sorry. It's not going to happen. No matter who is sent to plead the case.These reviews are done.",
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Who Mourns for Adonais? (TV Episode 1967)",Just OK,"This one is a hokey. And sexist. Some ""Greek God"" from 5000 years ago is looking for worshipers and the Enterprise stumbles coincidentally into the situation. There is an image of a hand which turns out to be a force field. The alien then contacts the crew. Mr Spock is specifically requested to stay behind, conveniently allowing him to fix the technical conundrum. A beautiful blonde female crew person, with an elaborate hair-do, ie Yeoman Rand-esque and back-lit to further enhance her appeal, is included in the landing party. The Captain and the Doctor have actually been speculating on how long it will take her to quit the service, get married and have babies. We have Scotty showing romantic tendencies, ie jealousy, which he never did before or since. Hhhmmm...Unlike some of the other women in previous episodes, this female first betrays, but is eventually loyal to her crew and captain, helping to save the day.The overall story line here is weak and very sexist. It seems to take the Captain a very long time to understand the alien's power. The wig on Walter Koenig is absolutely ridiculous. Not one of my favorites.",5

That is something that Captain James T. Kirk is not willing to do nor are any of the rest of his crew.Michael Forest who did a few peplum pictures back in the day guest stars as a really great physical specimen who claims he's Apollo. And he's certainly performing some feats that would make one think he's got some powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal man. It's the job of the Enterprise away team to find his Kryptonite.William Shatner theorizes that back in the day a race of super beings did land on earth, maybe gathered at Mount Olympus and certainly would have appeared to have been Gods to the shepherds. And these Gods had all the human vices as well. For that Shatner is depending on archaeologist Leslie Parrish with the away team to help out. And there certainly is a mutual attraction though Jimmy Doohan who kind of likes Parrish himself ain't ready to worship and ain't ready to give her up.Just as humankind advanced I would have thought that those beings that were labeled Gods also would have advanced a bit and taken account the evolution of humans.

Carolyn Palamas; an attractive young archaeologist who is clearly fancied by Scotty. Once on the planet it becomes clear that Apollo wishes to be worshipped in the way the ancient Greeks worshipped him and his fellow 'gods'. He is quick to anger and takes an interest in Lt. Palamas that clearly riles Scotty. While Apollo is off with Lt. Palamas the others try to discover the source of his power.The idea that the ancient gods were in fact visiting aliens is interesting and has been used many times since however here it seems like a way to make an apparently all powerful being a bit more interesting. His Olympus seems more like a small folly than a home of the gods and his patience is awfully short for a being who has waited five thousand years for humanity to advance to the point they can travel to him. As soon as we see Scotty flirting with the previously unmentioned Lt. Palamas we can guess that she will somehow be important in this episode and indeed she is as she appears to fall for Apollo a little surprising given that he changed her out of her uniform into a garment that was clearly designed to appeal to the male viewers although I suppose his attire could equally have been meant as a treat to the female viewers! While the story was a bit sillier than usual the conclusion was pretty good in a bitter-sweet way. Overall I thought this was a somewhat weaker than average episode but enjoyable none the less.",7

Good thing his toga grows with him. Of course, he finds the (guest star) blonde Earth woman extremely attractive. Really low budget. One of those ""forgettable"" Star Trek Episodes.

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. Unlike any other hit series, it only has 3 seasons so luckily it means that they will be covering up all their ideas within it until they are satisfied. As it often happens, the first season is always promising and has potential (or else it won't lift up for further more seasons) in it and is utilized with fine detailed work like focusing on different new breeds and characters bonding through this journey.The whole episode was based on just a mere idea if they would have made it gripping by encountering close calls and some critical crisis, it would have worked a lot better but instead it just seems like another Monday for the enterprise.",

So what happens? A giant hand shows up in space and grabs the Enterprise. That hand belongs to a mythical creature (yes, they were mythical creatures made up by poets like Homer and an ignorant culture). Apollo is the guy and he has infinite power. Of course, infinite power doesn't help much when Captain Kirk is at work. He just wants to get on with things, so he brings his pretty young archaeologist (an expert on Greek culture) with him. Really, a starship has a rather sparse representation of experts. Why would you need a person versed in Greek studies aboard a starship. Anyway, the big lunk woos the young woman and takes on her admiration and love. Kirk and the boys aren't about to worship this guy. Granted he is lonely, but sitting around tending sheep doesn't sound like much of a life. The problem is, he is powerful and can do what he wants, whenever he wants. Still, he can't stand to be criticized. Kirk employs the young woman to taunt him and force him to exert energy. After a start with ""Amok Time,"" this seems like a tawdry effort. I guess it was popular enough. Once again, when in doubt, go for the lowest common denominator.",4

It turns out to be the work of a creature claiming to be the Greek god Apollo. He demands worship and adoration out of a resisting crew. He wants them to live on his planet forever; the crew mist figure out a way of escape. I like the idea of this episode: the Greek gods were actually aliens that came to Earth long ago and fell in love with the worship they received. I'm always down for some ancient aliens! But the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The giant hand is comically done, Scotty turns into a lovesick buffon for some reason, the dialogue is mostly boring, and the episode has a twinge of sexism. This is the second episode (I'm looking at you Khan) where a woman falls immediately for a ""sexy"" man. She lacks any self-control and betrays her crew instantly. At least in this episode she changed her tune but the cliché of a woman only looking for love and unable to think of much else is something I tire of. The ending's pretty good but it feels like forever until we reach there. The writer of this episode never wrote for Star Trek again and perhaps that's not accidental. This is a slow moving hour.",5
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Changeling (TV Episode 1967)",Inspired first ST movie,"This episode obviously inspired the plot of the first Star Trek Movie where the mysterious and immensely powerful and dangerously destructive evil force is referred to as ""V-ger"" by the kidnapped and subsequently returned (and reprogrammed) female crewperson of the new and improved Enterprise.In the movie eventually Kirk and Spock figure out that ""V-Ger"" is really the old Voyager spacecraft sent out as a probe in the twentieth century (they clean some charcoal off the 2nd through 4th letters of the machine's still existent painted on name) and long lost track of. Well, clearly it must have been damaged in flight at some point and then met up with some other probe of some other kind from some other planet with some other prime directive. The two machines ""helped"" each other repair themselves and combined forces to become much stronger but corrupting their prime directives as the two combined forces.But gee, how could they figure all that out about V-Ger? Well, maybe it's because they went through most of all that before with the TV episode involving Nomad: the 1 meter long, square columnar, self-levitating and mobilizing metal box around which this episode revolved. Nomad had basically the same background story and was just as terse and ruthless in carrying out it's corrupted prime directive (and with just as much unlimited power - albeit on a much more limited production budget) to ""Sterilize! Sterilize!"" as V-Ger.I mean...Spock had already solved the Nomad mystery via a Vulcan mind meld with Nomad (via ""Creator Kirk"" 's permission) so figuring out V-Ger's problem must have been a piece of cake! My favorite Nomad quote is simply ""Non Sequiter!"" when presented with some feeble attempt at logic by an obviously inferior human. As soon as I first heard it I immediately added it to my vocabulary...and have used it quite frequently ever since.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Changeling (TV Episode 1967)","Inspiration for Star Trek: The Motion Picture, which was better","As others have noted, this episode was the inspiration for Star Trek: The Motion Picture, involving the powerful Vejur entity. But the movie had a much more satisfying resolution, and was sort of an ""improved"" version of this episode.Basically, the Enterprise encounters an immensely powerful space probe that originated on Earth (Nomad), was subsequently altered by contact with a much more powerful alien probe, and now seeks to ""sterilize"" all ""imperfections"", which include ""biological units"". In other words, it threatens to wipe out all biological life, and it has the power to do it. The only thing that saves the Enterprise, at first, is that the machine mistakenly thinks Kirk is its creator, solely because of damage to its databanks and the similarity of Kirk's name to that of the true creator, ""Roykirk"", from centuries ago on Earth, and the machine somewhat inexplicably chooses to obey instructions from its perceived creator.The episode did have some impressive dramatic moments, like the demonstrations of Nomad's power-- able to fire warp 15 energy bolts supposedly containing the power of 90 photon torpedos (which really should have obliterated the Enterprise with one shot, rather than taking five!); able to increase engine efficiency of the Enterprise to reach at least warp 11; able to absorb a direct hit with a photon torpedo, with no damage whatsoever; able to restore a recently killed crewman (Scotty).The immense power of the being, and the fact that it is inevitably going to discover that Kirk is an ""imperfect biological entity"" and wipe out all humankind, creates an interesting enough dilemma for the crew to solve, but the resolution was really pretty silly. Kirk basically ""outwits"" the ""perfect"" and almost inconceivably sophisticated Nomad by pointing out that Nomad erred in concluding he was its creator; therefore, Nomad must 'sterilize' itself.This sort of pat and convenient ending was hardly a plausible one, for many reasons. First, it was hardly believable that Nomad would have made the initial mistake that Kirk was its creator. Even if it had the name ""James Kirk"" in its damaged databanks for some reason instead of the correct name ""Roykirk"", it seems doubtful that a computer that advanced would have just assumed, without more information, that this was the same man who was its creator. More importantly, wouldn't it have long ago realized that it was created by the ""inferior"" biological units anyway? So even meeting its creator should hardly have impressed it; unless it had some residual programming that 'required' that it obey its creator-- in which case it shouldn't have mattered if it knew whether Kirk was biological or not! (and Kirk could have just ordered it to destroy itself, while it was under the illusion that Kirk was its creator). Finally, even if Nomad didn't already know that Kirk was a ""mere biological unit"", it was so advanced and powerful that it should have detected that fact right away upon encountering him without needing Kirk to ""slip up"" later and spill the beans.There really could be no 'happy' resolution here, in that Nomad had nothing left but an odd cold malevolence: the mission to 'sterilize' all imperfection, including all biological life. The silly ending in which Kirk ""out-logics"" the supreme computer was basically a necessary ""cop out"" to get out of an impossible situation.In The Motion Picture, the result is much more satisfying. There, Vejur is not as malevolent as Nomad, but instead seeks to seek out and acquire all knowledge in the universe, a pretty lofty goal. Vejur is portrayed as a 'child' that yearns to know its 'roots', to learn how it was created, which leads it to trace its origins to Earth's systems and seek out its creator there. When the truth is revealed to it, the creature embraces this fact and merges with the descendants of its creator (in that case, Decker and Ilja). Certainly a much more satisfactory resolution.",5
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Changeling (TV Episode 1967)",Nomad's Goal: Sterilize All Biological Units,"Yipes, Kirk's taken aboard some problematic entities before, but nothing quite so dangerous as this invincible little machine whose only goal is eradicating human beings. Well, Kirk had no choice really - the first act depicted the Enterprise as just one more power blast away from being vaporized. But, boy, that Kirk is one lucky starship captain (when you think about it, plain luck plays a huge role in Kirk's incredible Starfleet career) - his name happens to resemble that of Nomad's creator; that is, the creator of the original Nomad. The new upgraded version here has the power to wipe out the populations of entire solar systems - a benefit of having joined with some other alien probe. This kind of act - one of sheer genocide - should be almost unimaginably horrific, but is sort of brushed over in this episode, perhaps the main weakness in the storytelling. Sure, McCoy acts as indignant as he can be, but he reacts more intensely over what happens to Scotty & Uhura here. Scotty seems to have perfected the hot-tempered, impulsive crewman in this and the previous episode, ""Who Mourns For Adonais?"" In that last one, he was walloped by the alien Apollo; in this, he's killed by the alienated machine - yes, this is Scotty's final episode...just kidding.Probably the strongest aspect of this episode is how they were able to create and convey an interesting character out of what amounts to a hovering metallic cylinder. Somehow, with the fine writing, the dialog, and the voice of actor Perrin, we get a fully-realized creation, one which inspires both dread and, more impressively, actual sympathy. Think the ""Charlie X"" character from the first season, done up as a super-robot. This Nomad, an early version of actual robotic life - an alternate sort of life - believes it has found its mother, Kirk. Like any child eager to please, its actions now revolve around trying to impress his mother/creator. It's kind of a touching turn of events and, when disillusionment sets in - when it realizes Kirk is just another biological unit - it becomes hurt & pouting, refusing to speak, until it at last says 'stop,' clearly in a tone suggesting profound sadness. Adding to the overall tragedy, 4 red-shirts are obliterated in short order - Nomad doesn't mess around. It's all the more embarrassing that this episode concludes with one those cutesy exchanges between the main trio - hey, guys, what about those billions of dead? Some respect, hm? This episode was essentially remade as ""Star Trek-the Motion Picture"" in '79, with a somewhat larger budget.",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Changeling (TV Episode 1967)",Shatner Saves It (mostly),"Yeah, lots of plot holes and cheesy special effects but this is one of my favorites, and it's entirely due to Shatner's restrained (for once) performance. He actually seems to be acting and responding to the crew (mainly Spock) like a normal human being without any of his typical over- the-top hamming it up. Well, with the exception of the ending where, sadly, the writers reverted back to the cutesy crap. I can't really blame Shatner for that, either. When given decent dialog in the rest of show, The Shat did alright in this one, making it one of the most watchable episodes.And a shout-out to user verbusen for noticing Lt. Leslie in his review. After rewatching these episodes many times, you start picking up the small things in the background, and Lt. Leslie at the helm next to Sulu, as well as wearing a gold tunic (as opposed to his typical red) is unusual. What isn't unusual, of course, is that Leslie has no lines. It's worth noting that the actor who played Leslie, Eddie Paskey, made a point of actually reading the scripts beforehand so he knew when an anonymous red-shirt was going to get offed, and made a point of making himself scarce during those red-shirt casting calls.",8

The half-earth, half-alien probe thinks it has orders to sterilize imperfect life-forms, and the crew has to find a way to keep it under control before it kills them. A great climax - Kirk using logic to destroy Nomad - brings it to a great conclusion, and almost makes up for a very illogical element.Nomad absorbs Uhura's memory , rendering her useless for most of the episode. Nomad is unable to restore it, so McCoy and his team reeducate her over a few weeks. Really?

It's sort of sitcom without the com. In this episode, a wandering probe that was to be used for benevolent purposes has collided with another device and its mission has changed. It is called ""Nomad"" because it travels from place to place. Unfortunately, it destroys anything with imperfections; that includes even modest things. In a ridiculous move, it finds Uhura to be imperfect and wipes her memory clean. She is put back in kindergarten. Does anyone see how stupid this is? Even if she is retrained, she has no experiences or data to do her job. Others are killed when they confront the thing. The only salvation is that the thing has mistaken Kirk for the creator of the device. It moves around the ship like an efficiency expert in the sixties (although the worst that could happen then was you got fired). As time goes along, the probe starts to put two and two together and Kirk's control of it begins to wane. Spock is able to figure out its skewed mission by doing the old mind meld. So what to do. The conclusion has to do with logic. Spock's kind of logic.",6
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Changeling (TV Episode 1967)",I Am Nomad. The Concept for The First Star Trek Movie,"In Star Trek the Motion Picture, Nomad was called ""Vegur"", the changeling satellite that created the first hot female ""Borg"" woman. (Actress Persis Khambatta) Like ""Space Seed"" (used for the 2nd movie concept), an original series episode was used as the basis for the first extremely overly-long, overblown ""Star Trek"" movie. It's amazing how they managed to created such a menacing beastie with a grey garbage disposal and a flashing Radio Shack metal project box, dangling from a tether! Best watched ""enhanced"" so any rigging is not visible! Very well done on an obvious ""shoe-string"" budget. Nomad collided with an alien probe and got its wires crossed. So, instead of seeking out new life forms, it seeks out and ""sterilizes"" (kills) all imperfect biological ""infestations"". It is now headed toward Earth, of course! Nomad ""zaps"" four security guards out of existence and allows Kirk to exercise his brain using perfect logic that even impresses Mr. Spock. (""Nomad...You are imperfect and must exercise your prime directive"") The line ""Nomad...error...error..."" will remain forever in my memory banks! A very enjoyable episode.",8
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Changeling (TV Episode 1967)",Some promising material wasted in a badly written episode,"Nomad, an intelligent, deadly, and seemly indestructible space probe, comes on board the Enterprise. It's objective is to destroy any imperfect life forms (which pretty much means all life forms). The only thing that buys the Enterprise crew time before Nomad kills them all is that Nomad erroneously thinks Kirk is its inventor, but that stroke of luck might not last forever.This episode is so sad, because there is a lot of good material here that is inexplicably wasted through needlessly bad script decisions.The good: Nomad is genuinely menacing. You can sense Kirk and his crew are terrified, watching what they say and do because at any moment this unpredictable machine could effortlessly kill them all. The episode manages to create that real tension, and that real feeling the crew is walking a razor's edge.But such an effective atmosphere of fear, which could have supported a great episode, is ruined by some terrible additions. Lt. Uhura is drained of her knowledge and has to be re-educated, and that whole scene is embarrassing and drags down the episode. And it was not necessary. Why was it put in there at all? Then Spock does a mind meld with the robot and provides another embarrassing, silly scene. Once again, it was not necessary: there were other ways to convey the admittedly fascinating idea of two robots merging in the depths of space.Then four red shirts die in a contrived way: Kirk just sends them to guard Nomad, they inexplicably shoot at it, and all die. Admittedly it helps establish that Nomad does not kid around, and is lethal, but it also was contrived. Nomad's lethality could have been communicated without the need for anybody, especially Kirk, to do anything stupid. Nomad could have simply killed somebody for making a routine mistake.Finally, and worst of all, the episode, filled with fear and death, ends with a lame joke, as if all the lost lives move no one. This ""lame joke ending"" approach almost tanked ""The Galileo Seven"" episode, but here it puts the last nail in the coffin of ""The Changeling."" Star Trek has lots of good episodes. ""The Changeling"" is one of the worst, and the saddest part is it could easily have avoided that.",3
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Changeling (TV Episode 1967)","""A mass of conflicting impulses.""","This episode's robot may be criminally insane, but he gives a pretty dead-on definition of the ""weaker sex"": ""That unit is defective. Its thinking is chaotic... A mass of conflicting impulses."" So wonderfully un-PC! You won't get lines like that in any modern sci-fi, especially those wretched ST spin-offs. So, yes, Nomad is very perceptive. However, not clever enough to also have told us something we did not know until recently: ""The unit called Sulu is as happy as Liberace's pink poodle."" Nomad was created when an Earth satellite/robot merged with an alien device. The former was programmed for finding new life forms, the latter for sterilization. Together they became the killer robot who gave Scotty a brief glimpse into the world of the dead. That's sort of like Anjelina Jolie merging with a Catholic priest: the result would be a skinny person that will want to massively adopt children - but for all the wrong reasons.""And when it gets there, it will find Earth is infested with imperfect biological units."" (Kirk) Yes, faulty beings such as Sean Penn, Gwyneth Paltrow, Susan Sarandon, and John Grisham. Pity Spock wasn't able to re-programme Nomad into a purely ""getting-rid-of-Hollywood morons"" killing machine and then sent him to this dump of a planet...After losing two red-shirts (ST's dodo birds), Kirk sends TWO more of these luckless guys to guard over Nomad. Why? Weren't those two deaths - plus the genocide of 4 billion people on planet Whatchamacallit - indication enough to be careful around this thing? But I can almost hear Gene Roddenberry's voice: ""Nah... There's plenty where those 4 extras came from..."" Speaking of those 4 billion dead, the episode reminds me of ""The Immunity Syndrome"" and ""Light Of Zetar"" where several billion colonists/inhabitants also kick the bucket; the ease with which the story brushes away those statistics once they're announced is fairly worrying.It's interesting that Uhura's complete memory banks have been erased, including English, and yet she speaks fluent Swahili. Does this mean that Swahili takes up space somewhere else in the brain? If so, I wonder where a beautiful language like German is stored... perhaps in another part of the body. I won't say which.Regarding the premise of the episode, of course the first movie was based on it. The best movie, I might add. Those who hate it usually love parts 2, 3 and 6, which are just your standard dumb comic-book-like action fare for very young kids. One reviewer here complains that STTMP is too dull; for such people every scene has to have a bomb explode or Spock giving someone a neck-pinch. STTMP has a proper sci-fi story - which is naturally off-putting to Trekkies, who prefer soap-opera garbage camouflaged as sci-fi (see ""The Next Generation"", every housewife's favourite ""sci-fi"" series). As for a human trying to outwit or ""out-logic"" a machine, as Kirk does at the end, Carpenter's ""Dark Star"" used pretty much the same approach, to very funny effect.",

I just rewatched it since it's been a long time and I wanted to play the series for my Wife who never watched Trek before much. SPOILERSIt just dawned on after I have watched this episode like a dozen times in my life, when they are beaming Nomad aboard in the beginning, why didn't they scatter it's atoms into space instead of beaming it onboard? I read about the transporter on wikipedia and when they transport Nomad it is briefly inside the transporter before it is rematerialized. Scotty was busy with the warp drive, and Spock was in shock to think about it? Lol. I guess Kirk knew he could do that but his search for new life and new civilizations prompt him not to destroy Nomad right away in the beginning (at the expense of many Red Shirt crewmen). Lol. Since I have watched these episodes many times, to make it interesting I look for Lt. Leslie (actor Eddie Paskey) who was in around 57 or so episodes but rarely had any lines. Here Mr Leslie is luckily wearing a Gold Shirt on the bridge, and spared being one of the multiple Red Shirts vaporized in the hallways by Nomad.

Through mathematical communication (its language was coming to them through subspace channels that way), the Enterprise establishes contact. It is small in ""bulk"" (a funny line where Scotty ponders how intelligent life could exist in something so small, Spock logically corrects him that ""size doesn't matter"") and agrees to be transported on board the ship. The lifeform is actually a probe launched from Earth in the ""2000s"" to collect samples from sources in space, actually colliding with a meteorite and presumed destroyed. Instead, this probe, which calls itself Nomad, survived, actually ""merging"" with an alien probe of some sort, becoming ""something else entirely"". Its memory banks faulty (it kills ""imperfect biological organisms"") but ""improved"" through its ability to ""sterilize"" life with a beam that eviscerates immediately, Nomad believes Kirk (his name favoring the real inventor of it) is its creator which actually helps to keep (most of) the crew from certain death. Kirk will need to determine a course of action to stop Nomad before it reaches Earth, a planet with plenty of biological imperfection, bound to be exterminated when it arrives. Spock actually performs a Vulcan mind meld on the probe in one of the episode's highlights. Kirk trying to hold off the Nomad's ""evaluation"" and ""investigation"" which could lead to his ship's ""sterilization"" is key to the episode's tension. Once again Kirk will need to analyze the situation, and with assistance from Spock and others, reason how to ""trick"" Nomad, to confuse it so that its programming is undermined. Scotty killed and resurrected by Nomad, along with Uhura ""dumbed"" by Nomad because she was singing, are also stunning developments in the episode. Kirk once again pitted against a machine; this is nothing new, but the show was able to organize different ways to incorporate ideas around the framework of a mechanical creation dictating terms through the use of weaponized engineering.",7

I think I would have scored this one higher, as other viewers have pointed out, if Nomad wasn't made out of sheet metal to look like something out of the 1950's instead of the thirty fourth century. OK, the budget was limited, but it further reinforces my belief that some of these shows are better viewed in black and white instead of living color.But feeling halfway generous, this wasn't such a bad episode. The concept underlying Nomad's re-creation and it's imperative to destroy imperfection was certainly worthy of the sci-fi touch. Spock really gives it his all with the Vulcan mind probe, and can it be!!! - unlike Captain Kirk's faux demise in 'Amok Time', Scotty REALLY bought the farm in this one. Thankfully the writers brought him back within ten minutes instead of hanging him out to dry for a couple of weeks.You know, I wondered if that picture of Jackson Roykirk was meant to represent someone connected to the show.

Kirk is its creator! Apparently it has mistaken Kirk for the long dead Dr. Jackson Roykirk. Nomad is beamed aboard the Enterprise where Kirk plays along with Nomad's belief that he is its creator. Nomad's original programme was to search out new life forms but somehow it has changed; it is now searching for perfect lifeforms and is 'sterilising' anything it finds imperfect. As it learns more it states its intention to return to its launch point, Earth, and sterilise any imperfections there; Kirk will have to use a logical approach if he is to destroy Nomad before it kills everybody aboard his ship.While this isn't a great episode it is certainly pretty good; Nomad is genuinely menacing despite its bargain basement appearance; it demonstrates an ability to kill and to cure as well as effecting Uhura in a way that leaves her mind almost empty. The way Kirk ultimately uses logic to force Nomad to destroy itself is somewhat cliché but was done in enjoyable way thanks to William Shatner's performance.

It's called Nomad and having met another probe out in space it took on a new mission, to remove all imperfections from the Universe. And in its universal view, all biological life is most inefficient and henceforth imperfect.However the scientist back on earth who designed Nomad was also named Kirk and therein lies the weapon that William Shatner uses to best the probe.

The story concept is intriguing enough, but the interpersonal interaction with the mechanical antagonist and Enterprise crew, to me at least, is nearly laughable. If I'm watching classic Trek, and this thing happens to be on the DVD set I've got in the player, then I may keep it on in the background, but it's really painful to watch at times.To me this episode is the poster boy for people to point at who think Star Trek is stupid. And you know what? I'd be hard pressed to deny them that claim after watching this particular installment.I just don't know what went wrong here. For all the money that they had to spend on this episode, was this really the best the creative team could come up with? One is reminded of ""Red Dwarf's"" props department, and the Holly-Hop drive prop. Yeah, it's that bad.Shatner and gang give us Kirk and crew to outwit a schizophrenic robot. It's a little cliché in that regard, which just adds another nail in the coffin for this episode, but it's not really the defining moment as some may think.Not a worthy installment of the franchise, if somewhat interesting.

Great use of the Vulcan mind meld, the ideal solution when someone will not (or can not) explain their true selves.",8
18,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Changeling (TV Episode 1967)","Despite being a decent episode, I really wish this had never aired","My biggest complaint about this episode isn't really the fault of the episode itself. Let me explain. Despite this being, at best, an ordinary episode, it was re-tooled years later into the first Star Trek movie. And, if you haven't seen it, this movie is horrid--being one of the dullest sci-fi movies ever. The problems were many with STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE, but one fundamental problem was that the idea didn't merit an entire LONG movie. At only one hour, this concept was workable--at 2348362 hours (or so it seemed when I sat there opening night to see it), it's pure padding.Now, let's set aside the trauma that was STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE and concentrate on this episode. The crew encounters an evil little space probe (M-5) that destroys everything in its path. How this little hovering pile of scrap is able to do this does seem a bit hard to believe, but the worn and torn device seems to think that Kirk is its mother and so it stops its murderous galactic rampage. So far, so good. But, later, it runs amok on the ship and does some nasty little things. Then Kirk, using his vastly superior mind, confuses the crap out of M-5 and it blows itself to bits.The episode is stuck on the ship, so some might find the action a bit subdued and claustrophobic. My problem is that the show was only mildly diverting.",7

Thus entity turns out to be a highly sophisticated robot that attacks the Enterprise. The robot eventually heads aboard and, due to damaged memory banks, identifies Kirk as its creator. It turns out the machine is a hybrid between an old Earth probe that was thought to be destroyed by a meteor long ago and an alien probe. The two repaired each other and combine to make Nomad. It created a new garbled directive to exterminate any imperfect beings it comes across. After killing Scotty and bringing him back to life, wiping Uhura's memory, and downloading all of the Enterprise's data, Kirk must confuse the machine enough to stop it from destroying the crew and heading for Earth. He convinces Nomad that it is imperfect and must destroy itself due to its prime directive.The premise of this high-functioning machine mistaking its creator for Kirk just because they have similar last names is difficult to buy into. A child makes this mistake, not something as sophisticated as this. Putting that aside, I really enjoy the rest of this episode. The writer's are really able to make a three dimensional character out of the floating Nomad. He seems scary, all-powerful, and unstoppable. There's something about the blankness of a machine as it computes data and figures out its next move which is oddly terrifying. Its lack of expression gives us no indication of what will come next. Kirk's cleverness saves the day once again, much to the surprise of Spock. With that duo at the helm, it seems like they can accomplish anything. One final note, we only meet the Malurians once in the Star Trek universe, when Captain Archer finds some of them illegally mining on a planet still in the rudimentary stages of cultural evolution. It's a shame that their only appearance is such a black mark on their species.",7
21,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Changeling (TV Episode 1967)",blood born does not act that swiftly..,"Star TrekThe ChangelingA cultural hub and by far one of the most loved and respected tale, Star Trek is created by Gene Roddenberry who wrote this brilliant concept, ahead of its time and is probably why it still doesn't fail to entertain us after these many years. It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. Unlike any other hit series, it only has 3 seasons so luckily it means that they will be covering up all their ideas within it until they are satisfied. As it often happens, the first season is always promising and has potential (or else it won't lift up for further more seasons) in it and is utilized with fine detailed work like focusing on different new breeds and characters bonding through this journey.Not only was the concept intriguing enough to invest in it but even the writing is smart and gripping till the last frame holding the audience on the edge of the seat and delivers more than what was anticipated (the last act is written brilliantly).",
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Mirror, Mirror (TV Episode 1967)",The Agony of an Empire,"When the bearded Spock says 'Your Agonizer, Please,' you know you're in for some great science fiction, Trek style. If I was under threat of an Agony Booth to make a choice, I'd have to go with this episode as my all-time favorite of the original series. Not an easy choice, of course. ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" is more literate and ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" may get by better on sheer entertainment value, but there's something about tapping into the dark side of all our beloved characters here which makes this an irresistible mix of tension and adventure - an ultimate Trek, if you will. For you see, it's not just the depiction of the alternate versions of Spock, Sulu and Chekov in this violent, parallel universe that's so intriguing. There's also the thrill of observing our Kirk swiftly adapt to his new environment: sure, he gets caught off-guard by the evil Chekov early on, but in the next minute he's knocking out his supposed savior - see, that's what the evil Kirk would do and our Kirk has already figured it all out. It's tantalizing, no pun intended, to surmise just how our good Kirk would have survived in this universe of the evil Empire had he been stuck there for the rest of his life; personally, I think he would've taken over the whole galaxy within the next decade - he's just that quick on his feet. Witness the scene of him and the bearded Spock as they stroll down the ship's corridor, their personal bodyguards following; Kirk's in complete control. I think part of him was looking forward to the prospect of remaining in this savage universe when it looked like he'd have to operate the transporter to send the others back near the end.And it's not just Kirk - wonder of wonders, could this be our Uhura - taunting the evil Sulu, slapping him and stopping just short of sticking a little blade between his ribs? Looks to me like she was trained for a lot more than just communications - yes, she had that little scene of fright overcoming her before Kirk's pep talk, but after that, there was no stopping her. In a way, this episode is mesmerizing: you wonder what our intrepid foursome of cosmic castaways will run into next in every scene and how they'll handle it. The scripting doesn't disappoint: there are creative innovations to this strangely atmospheric Enterprise around every corner, subtle or jarring. The new gadgets are interesting but my favorite innovation is the entire concept of special bodyguards shadowing their superiors - that twist just spells Empire not Federation. Of course, the whole assassination angle is a dead giveaway. Plotwise, it's an excellent tightrope, and we get to see some of the best action scenes towards the climax. And then we have the evil, yet not so evil Spock. When Spock puts his mind to it, he can be pretty scary; it's hard to forget his sinister threat to Sulu. But, speaking of Sulu, strange as it may seem after all the great stuff just described, Takei as Sulu ends up with the greatest single scene of the episode. His bid to take over the ship, as he describes his plan to get rid of both Kirk & Spock, takes it all to yet another level. Dripping with slimy intensity, twirling his knife, a gleam of manic nastiness in his eyes, Takei just nails it. He should have played villains for the rest of his career.The potency of this episode is reflected in the fact that the later Trek series, Deep Space Nine, featured several episodes as sequels to this one. However, good as they were for a DS9 series, they paled in comparison to this original wonder.",10
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Mirror, Mirror (TV Episode 1967)",A must-see for Star Trek fans,"Despite some gnawing scientific inconsistencies, ""Mirror, Mirror"" is one of the best of the original ""Star Trek"" episodes, a triumph of character examination.A landing party of Kirk, McCoy, Scottie and Uhura is beaming back up from negotiations with the Halkans for dilithium-crystal mining rights when an ion storm opens a porthole between two parallel universes, and the landing party ends up on an ""Enterprise"" in the other universe -- a ship, crew and reality they barely recognize.In this universe, Star Fleet is the military arm of an evil Empire which, as Kirk warns the parallel Halkan commissioner, ""will level your planet and TAKE what we want -- that is destruction: you will die as a race."" The crew of this ""Enterprise"" is a bloodthirsty band of pirates and evil opportunists. The writers had a marvelous opportunity to examine the negative side of the show's characters, and they didn't waste it. While Spock (sporting a very-complimentary mustache and goatee) remains mostly true to the unemotional, logical Federation Spock, Sulu proves to be a cunning plotter and schemer (and, late in the episode, a scene-stealer), while young Checkov turns out to be an impetuous risk-taker who nearly pays the ultimate price for attempting to assassinate what he believes to be a suddenly-traitorous Kirk. In short, the parallel main characters are exactly what someone familiar with ""Star Trek"" would expect knowing their normal personalities.While trying to figure out how to get back to their own universe, Kirk also must avoid destroying the peace-loving Halkans, who refuse to deal with the Empire because of the power for killing and destruction that their dilithium crystals would give them. When he delays by giving the Halkans a twelve-hour ultimatum to consider their position, he is in violation of standard Empire procedure...and the Empire orders Spock to kill Kirk and assume command of the ship, in which case all other officers would move up one step in rank. Unbeknownst to anyone, the cunning Sulu plans to do away with both Kirk AND Spock, contriving to make it appear that they've killed each other when Spock set out to assassinate Kirk -- ""after a fierce battle.""Kirk is faced with a further complication when he discovers a knock-out gorgeous mistress waiting for him in his cabin. Barbara Luna guest-stars as Lt. Marlena Moreau...without question, the sexiest woman ever to appear in the series. A sizzling seductress -- oozing ""come-hither"" sexuality one moment and with a knee-buckling fire in her eyes the next -- the clever, opportunistic and spirited Marlena has hitched her wagon to the parallel Kirk because she desires to be ""the woman of a Caesar"", and finds that THIS Kirk is a lot less brutal and insensitive than the one she's used to. One sees her sexual excitement stirred to a torrent when she believes that Kirk has some secret plot to reach unprecedented heights -- power is clearly an all-consuming aphrodisiac with her.Yet, Marlena also seems to be the only one outside of Spock smart enough to be perplexed by Kirk's behavior; stunned by his compassion, she tells him in wonder, ""You're a stranger."" And she's apparently not displeased by this, either, because she then asks him, ""Am I your woman?"", clearly not caring whether he's the Kirk she knows or not because she wants this man. Unbeknownst to Kirk, she uses a secret device known as the Tantalus Field -- a spying device plundered by the parallel Kirk during one of his previous missions -- to monitor this ""stranger"" Kirk's actions, and will soon come to realize that she was more right than she knew.Meanwhile, Kirk and Scottie find a way to create an artificial field wherein they can all transport back to their own universe...but clandestine maneuvering is next to impossible in this paranoid environment. And the clock is ticking -- within no time, the field density between the two universes will close, and the landing party will be stuck forever in this brutal new life.Among the inconsistencies is the notion that none of these ultra-suspicious and treacherous Empire crewmen seem to realize that the landing-party personnel have undergone serious personality changes. In a Nazi-like police state, even the most-minor of behavioral changes is generally viewed as proof that the person is involved in traitorous activities. No explanation is offered as to why or how the parallel, Empire landing party would be transported back to their home at the same time as ""the good guys"" would return themselves to the benevolent Federation. And, although his parallel character has some surprising self-interest to him, a logical, emotionless Spock would never agree that ""Terror must be maintained"" as this Spock does. On the theatrical front, Shatner lives up to some of his hammiest moments as the evil Kirk shouting after a departing Spock on the real ""Enterprise."" And the viewer has to force him- or herself to ignore the blatant use of stunt doubles in one fight sequence -- characters who, but for their uniforms, look nothing at all like Kirk, Spock or Scottie.Still, these are easy notions to put aside, because ""Mirror, Mirror"" is one of ""Star Trek""'s best examples of the provocative ""what-if"" nature of science fiction (second only to ""City on the Edge of Forever."") In its character examinations, it's also without peer in the show's history. One of the highlights is watching Uhura, needing to create a diversion on the bridge, tap into her own suppressed sexuality to lure Sulu's eyes from his security board. It's the only chance in the entire series for Uhura to play ""hot""...and she's scorching. One has to assume that the parallel Uhura is exactly this kind of woman, because no one on the Empire ""Enterprise"" bridge -- least of all the happy beneficiary, Sulu -- is the least bit surprised at the sight of Uhura the seductress. All in all, a highly-worthwhile viewing experience.",9
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Mirror, Mirror (TV Episode 1967)",Now THIS is the way I wanted to see Star Trek!!!!,"This is my vote for the all-time coolest episode ever--perhaps not the best, but definitely the coolest.The landing party beams back on the ship, but through an impossible to believe coincidence, the exact same members from a parallel universe do the same thing at the same time and are switched! The nice Star Trek crew members now find themselves in an evil bizarro world where the ship and crew are ultra-militaristic and cruel. In this parallel world, decency is despised and people get ahead by killing their superior officers! So, Kirk being at the top of the evil pecking order is open to a series of attempts on his life. This is made worse by the fact that Kirk won't obliterate a peaceful planet when the Evil Federation orders him. So, the crew must keep who they really are a secret and find a way to return home.Now, for the cool factor, the episode is chock full of it. Evil Spock looks and acts a lot like our good buddy Spock except he sports the neatest evil goatee AND he uses torture on poor old Evil Lt. Kyle when he thinks this crewman made a mistake (which he didn't!). Then, Evil Mr. Sulu is possibly even more cool because he sports a nifty scar on his face and is a homicidal maniac and sex pervert!! Then, Chekov tries to kill the Captain but when he fails he's placed in a horrible torture device! And, Kirk finds that in this world he not only has a sexy main squeeze but a secret device that makes his enemies vanish into thin air!!! The bottom line is that this episode is so much fun to watch. Instead of the usual prime directive and the overriding desire to do good, this anti-Enterprise world is just plain awful and a great counter-point to the sometimes saccharine-like world of Star Trek where everyone gets along a bit too often! It's a wonderful break from the usual and an episode you just can't miss.",10

Now the four have to find a way to get back to their own reality without being discovered and killed.This is one of the best-written, best-acted TOS episodes ever. Ordinarily there is some aspect of the writing to nitpick about. Not here. Every action anybody takes makes sense, the characters are developed superbly, and the pacing is swift and invigorating. This is quality TV writing, and if every script had been this good the series would have lasted a lot longer, I think. One moment I'd like to point out especially: early on Kirk proposed to disable the phasers so they can avoid phaser-bombing a helpless planet, but Scottie subtly reports to Kirk he cannot because the phaser banks are being guarded. This is good writing: the good guys had a sensible (not contrived) solution to a problem, and the obstacle to that solution also made perfect sense (and was not contrived). That makes the tension feel very real.The acting takes it over the top. William Shatner's Kirk displays the quick wits and cleverness that make the character so interesting. And notice how our good guy Kirk is not entirely uncomfortable in his new, dangerous environment. Sure, he's disgusted by all the cruelty around him, but you can sense he gets a thrill out of navigating all the treachery. Leonard Nimoy's evil version of Spock is genuinely menacing in a cool, calculating way. Nichelle Nichols' Uhura shows us a cunning, wily side of her we have only ever seen suggested before (and check her out in that revealing outfit.) But the acting prize goes to George Takei. In this episode, his evil Sulu is slimy, sleazy, scary, and wonderfully despicable. As another reviewer suggested, Takei should have played more villains.Overall, Mirror, Mirror is a ten.",10

6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Mirror, Mirror (TV Episode 1967)",Terror Must Be Maintained,"Many starships of fans have said it but I'll join them; Mirror Mirror is arguably the best Star Trek ep ever made, and I'd say it's also one of the ten best single television broadcasts I've ever seen.Amazing work, seemingly born of the team taking an amazing TV show they had 100% confidence in and, can only guess but... on a specific edition (consciously intended or did it just happen?) deciding to push to make something about 100x better than even the excellent standard show they were already transmitting each week...? The Simpsons achieved similar with Last Exit to Springfield in 1993; a single episode from a (then) blisteringly outstanding stable that is outlandishly better than the pipingly strong pack around it, with observation, complexity and inspired touches almost every ten seconds or so;a Star Trek TOS episode is 50 min not 22, yet Mirror Mirror's pace, with the exception of perhaps and only the first sick bay scene, is almost as intense.Other reviewers have covered Mirror Mirror's plot and most points have been made, esp on the swift adaptation by all (except by perhaps McCoy) to realities in the Galactic Empire, but special mention has to go to both BarBara Luna and the writers for her character, Marlena Moreau.Marlena is likely the very best of Star Trek characters/guest leads ever. Probably only on screen for 10, max 15, of the full 50 mins, she adds an irreplaceable dimension of human ambition, frustration, amorality and yearning for a better life that none of the regulars, breath-taking though they are, ever match.It may be that all great shows, and all great writing and production teams, and indeed almost everyone who has passion for their work or any venture, find a time in his/her/its life when all's done, nothing hindered nothing feared and everything achieved; for original Star Trek this was it.",10
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Mirror, Mirror (TV Episode 1967)","Star Trek The Original Series--Mirror, Mirror","There's this planet rich in dilithium crystals, but the people (a pacifist society that do not believe in violence, but they also refrain from dealing with others because of the potential in this philosophy suffering when in relation with other beings) aren't interested in partnering with others, even though Kirk promises only amicable relations with them. When returning to the Enterprise, a lightning storm of considerable magnitude causes a transporter malfunction that sends the away team (Kirk, Uhura, Bones, and Scotty) into an alternate universe where the ship's crew is savage, treacherously calculating, self-absorbed, inhumane, and sadistic. The desire for power, status, position, and rank is of the utmost importance and to attain what they want the Federation of this universe are conquerers, concerned with what their conquests bring ""The Empire"". Consider this the Mr. Hyde Enterprise crew. Sufficed to say, Kirk and company want to return to their proper universe which will require some ingenuity, savvy, and more than a little luck. How to avoid constant attack for his rank of Captain, Kirk will have to survive the best he can until Scotty can arrange for them to transport all proper to their true Enterprise.Mirror, Mirror is a treat if just because it allows the cast to find their inner barbarian and play around with a darker side of human nature where reward comes with taking what you want through chicanery, deceit, and murder. Through his short time on the Enterprise from the Darkside, Kirk learns that his mirror evil self has used a device to make his superiors and enemies ""disappear"" in order to achieve his rank of Captain. Spock, even if a more savage Vulcan version, still operates under the logic of the orders demanded of the Empire, pressuring Kirk to execute the people on the planet below so they can take the dilithium crystals from them without their permission. Sure they give them a chance to just hand over the crystals despite their principles, but ultimately, the Empire will take them with or without their okay. Kirk delays the orders, which earns Spock's suspicions. Takei and Koenig both seem to be having a ton of fun in their parts as devious monsters (Takei even has a long scar down his face and constantly harasses Uhura) after Kirk's spot of Captain. The major developments that take precedence over even the vies for power are Spock's inquisitive pursuit of Kirk's motives behind his seemingly humanistic delays in conquering the people on the planet and trying to circumvent his efforts to stall until Scotty gets everything under operation for transport, and ""the Captain's lady"", Marlena (the stunning beauty BarBara Luna) awaiting Kirk in his quarters, finding him quizzically affectionate and his halting the use of the ""death ray"" to kill Spock further gives her pause to question his behavior. That's all part of detaining our heroes and keeping them from successfully hopping the first transport out of these dangerous new environs that offer constant threats of death and peril. The way the bearded, forward Spock continues to throw a monkey wrench in their plans, only to *assist* them at the end is a really cool development, as is the way he damn near overpowers Kirk, Scotty, Bones, and Uhura (he tosses her to the side in a heap and it is startling to see that against a woman in '67) by himself during a major scuffle in the Sick Bay. The dynamic between nervous Uhura and malcontent Sulu offers a good bit of tension, and Chekov nearly taking out Kirk, only to be treated to the pain box (a torture chamber that causes intense agony when officers attempt to kill their commanding officers), gives us a disturbing look into how violence is used so importantly in this universe. There's even a small agony box that is used when officers make minor mistakes, happening when Kirk and company first arrive in this mirror universe. Just a masterfully rendered episode that is proof positive of just how damn good the show could be when firing creatively on all cylinders.",10
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Mirror, Mirror (TV Episode 1967)",A personal favorite,"This episode is probably my personal favorite of the original series. It wasn't perfect, but it came pretty close, which is a remarkable achievement considering the severe budgetary and time limitations involved in putting together a regular weekly series. Excellent acting, scripting, and pacing, with nary a dull moment.The premise is that Kirk, McCoy, Scotty and Uhura somehow get transposed with their ""evil"" counterparts from a parallel universe in which the Federation is a brutal, conquering force, somewhat similar to the Klingons. Kirk and company have to figure out how to get home; meanwhile, Kirk tries to leave some positive mark on this alternate universe before he leaves...Some really nice touches in this episode. Subtle differences in the two ships and in the two crews. Kirk and company conveniently beaming up in the correct uniforms for that universe really didn't make sense, but was an understandable part of the writing to facilitate their covert infiltration of the new ship. The tough, bearded Spock may have been the most interesting incarnation portrayed by Nimoy on the series.Shatner was also in superb form here, and even Nichelle Nichols got a chance to shine, for once. Barbara Luna did a fine job as the sultry siren with a heart of gold.What makes this episode so great, to me, is that Kirk not only manages to effect the inevitable escape-- but he also leaves a lasting positive effect on the parallel universe, through potent rhetoric and oratory to the one honorable man, Spock. The implication is that the Marlena character will become the consort of bearded Spock as the new Captain (""you're the Captain's woman until he tells you otherwise""; also, she shares the secret of the Tantalus Field). Considering her earlier expressed admiration for Spock, this actually works out okay for both of them.I found it a bit too convenient, though, that the ""good"" Spock was so easily able to confine the evil versions of Kirk and company. I would think there would be serious chain of command problems involved, even if Spock had strong evidence for some sort of transposition. But given the limitations of the format, it was an acceptable solution to avoid complicating the plot even further. As it was, this was a superbly ambitious episode that crammed quite a bit of story into a short space. The clever bridge scene with the alternate Marlena made for a fine ending.",9

At that very time, something happens, sending him into another universe. it contains similar characters though they are beset with avarice and evil. Even Spock has accepted the fact that maintain discipline he must inflict pain on people, even kill them. Of course, if good Kirk is on this starship, his counterpart is on the Enterprise we know. Of course, here comes the fun. The good Kirk must figure out what happened and find some way to turn things back. The other Kirk sticks out like a sore thumb but has the power of his position.

13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Mirror, Mirror (TV Episode 1967)",By the Beard of Spock!,"""Mirror, Mirror"" opens on Kirk, Scotty, Bones, & Uhura negotiating with the Halkans on the surface of their planet amidst a bad ion storm. They want to mine the planet's dilithium crystals but the pacifist Halkans know how dangerous these crystals can be and refuse to give them to Kirk, even while knowing that the Federation can take them by force if they so wish. While beaming back aboard, the ion storm causes some type of disruption and the landing party end up beaming aboard the Enterprise but in a parallel dimension. In this one, Spock's got a goatee! The two landing parties have switched dimensions and our gang finds themselves in a much darker timeline. Here, the Federation is known as the Empire and everyone is much more barbaric and violent. Crew members ascend through the ranks by assassinating their superiors when possible. Both Chekov & Sulu attempt to kill their captain at points throughout the episode. Each high-ranking officer seems to have a batch of thug-like cronies that protect them from such coups. This dimension is much more temperamental. The Empire has commanded Kirk to kill the Halkans and take the dilithium crystals by force. Kirk must figure out a way to stop this from happening and get back to his rightful place as captain of the Enterprise in our dimension.Wow, what an episode! I've always loved the concept of parallel dimensions and the execution in this episode is flawless. Here, we have humans at their most primal and dangerous; we see totalitarian rule, complete with Nazi-esque salutes. The entire atmosphere in this culture feels off and unsettling. I love the concept of little gangs within the ship's command as people attempt to wrestle control from one another.I find it interesting that humans seem to be the only one's to be heavily contrasted between the two dimensions. Spock seems almost identical (plus facial hair); he still adheres to logic and the rule book at all times, even if the rules have changed. His portrayal here almost reminds me of the Vulcans before the Syrrannites started the Vulcan Reformation. Perhaps this is what might have happened if the Vulcans had stayed on their original path. The Halkans also maintain their pacifist views in both dimensions.A cool feature of the mirror dimension is Kirk's big-brother machine known as the Tantalus field which watches over his crew and can kill dissenters with the push of a button. Where this machine ends up in our dimension (or if it even exists) is anyone's guess but the threat of evaporation without warning is quite a trip.This is probably my favorite TOS episode that I've seen to date. It has great acting, a great script, a great science fiction concept. There's really nothing here not to like!",10
14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Mirror, Mirror (TV Episode 1967)","Good, Evil & Mirror Universes","Few episodes of Star Trek are quite as iconic as Mirror, Mirror. First broadcast in 1967 as part of the Original Series' second season, it's an episode that even people who aren't fans or even casual viewers of Star Trek will immediately know. After all, it's been references not just in other science fiction series such as Stargate SG-1 but also in shows like South Park. So what is it about the episode that makes it so memorable? A large part of it is undoubtedly the parallel universe concept at the heart of the episode, referenced and parodied time and again. Even back in 1967 when this episode first aired, the idea wasn't a new one by any means with writers, including this episode's writer Jerome Bixby with his own earlier short story One Way Street, having already explored the idea quite a bit. Bixby used that earlier short story as a jumping off point of sorts, with further rewrites being done by Gene Roddenbery, D.C. Fontana and Gene Coon, before the episode reached reached production. What seems to have been different here was that this was perhaps the first to take the idea and apply the idea to characters and situations in an established series. Not only that, but it presented what might be considered ""evil"" versions of those established elements long before it was the norm (Doctor Who, already nearly four years old when this episode first aired, would do it three years later in Inferno). That, combined with decades of re-runs and Star Trek's ever growing fan base, has helped to establish Mirror, Mirror as perhaps the definitive depiction of a parallel universe in popular culture.Well that and Spock's beard. Let's be honest: that's what people usually remember about this episode. As Friends would put it, this is ""the one with Spock's beard."" The parallel universe concept needed something visual to establish it early on and, if the viewer didn't notice that the crew beaming back aboard the Enterprise were wearing different uniforms, then they would definitely notice the normally clean shaven Vulcan sprouting a goatee beard. The sight was (and indeed remains) a great visual image and a shock to those viewing the episode in 1967 and in the decades to come. If you doubt it's cultural impact, just remember that it even inspired a band name at one point.The episode's parallel universe concept means that the cast can do things they normally would never get to do. Spock's beard may be a great visual image, but it also tells us that this isn't the Spock we've come to know and Leonard Nimoy's performance proves that as well. The Mirror Spock is every bit as logical as his ""normal"" self, but in this universe where there's an ever conquering Empire instead of a benevolent Federation, that logic has been turned to a cold and calculating level. When this Spock threatens Kirk and the Mirror Sulu late in the episode, he does so with a sense of cold menace that seems almost unthinkable from the Spock we've come to know and love. That's true of the entire cast from the normally likable Chekov attempting to assassinate Kirk to Sulu's advances on Uhura right down to the brief glimpse we get of the Mirror Kirk trapped in the ""normal"" universe.Then there's the four members of the landing party who swap places with their counterparts in the Mirror Universe. Kirk, McCoy, Scotty and Uhura are the proverbial fish of water who are trying to fit into an environment for which they are ill-suited. Kirk, as the lead character, is the episode's focal point and the one upon which we get the majority of our exposure to life in this universe. Shatner's performance here is one of his best as he deals with trying to avoid annihilating the Halkan's to his dealings with the episode's female guest character Marlena (Barbara Luna) and his trying to convince Mirror Spock to seek another way. Almost the entire landing party though deals with some trouble from Scotty's attempting to sabotage the phasers which arouses suspicions to Uhura dealing with the unwelcome advances from Sulu. From an acting point view the episode is one of the most memorable, and arguably one of the best, of the entire Original Series era.Also of mention is the production design and costumes. The redressing of familiar Enterprise sets and corridors, often done subtly, helps to reinforce the Mirror Universe setting with slight changes and the more obvious addition of the Empire's emblem of the Earth and dagger to the bridge set. The costumes as well also help to reinforce the notion as well with Kirk's costume and especially those used for female characters while others are more often than not just adaptations of those normally used. Those adaptations though, in both sets and costumes, works because it puts the viewer in familiar territory where it's the characters that are different, not the setting (plus it saves the production money).In the end, it isn't hard to see why this is one of the most iconic of all Star Trek episodes. The Mirror Universe concept, and especially how it's represented visually, remains striking and recognizable nearly fifty years later. Plus the acting is never less than interesting while the production design and costumes help to sell the parallel universe in ways both subtle and obvious. It's no wonder then that this episode has been referenced and parodied so much, as well as often being returned to in Trek itself. And long may it continue to be so...",9
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Mirror, Mirror (TV Episode 1967)",Best episode of the series!,"When Star Trek had a good story the results were golden! Mirror, Mirror, in my opinion, is the best episode of the series. Here is why: The story the Captain, Bones, etc through a transporter malfunction puts the crew in a reverse evil universe. A fascinating and riveting episode where the Enterprise tortures crew members, extorts other planets, Sulu has a scar on his face. How will the crew get back? There is a logical Spock except with a beard who is the same alternate on the evil enterprise. All the evil Spock wants is the evil captain back. Kirk adds a logical argument that the Empire will not last to Spock before the exit to the parallel universe. The mix of being lost in a evil world, to the develop of alternate characters creates a slow building uneasy tension. 10 out of 10 stars.",10

One that really uses all of the main cast in a meaningful way. It's probably not a coincidence then that it's the secondary players who truly shine here, all clearly relishing having more to do than push buttons and parrot orders.My quibbles are minor in the grand scheme. The tyrannical doppelgangers who switch places with our heroes get only short shrift, feeling more like an afterthought than an organic part of the story. I almost wish they had chosen to cut back and forth between the two. Though that split focus would've had its drawbacks, if done properly, I think it would've gotten the most out of this premise. I also think they could've eked out a bit more tension had Scotty's search for a way back been a part of their dilemma rather than the ""simple solution, difficult execution"" approach they took instead.But on the whole this is one of the tightest and most entertaining episodes from TOS.",8

Nichelle Nichols was the object of his lust and she had to alternately encourage and keep Takei at bay as the situation called.One person that was new was Barbara Luna essentially on the Enterprise to give William Shatner a little Nookie.

18,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Mirror, Mirror (TV Episode 1967)",Opposite End of the Spectrum,"It's always something we think about everyday, what would of happened or what would life of been like had we made this or that choice. Or what if a certain something occurred or the tide changed, what kind of society would we have, would it be better or worse? This is my second favorite episode of the entire show in fact one of my favorite episodes in general. Yeah it's true throughout the years the whole Parallel/Alternate universe concept has been played out from TV shows like ""Fringe"", ""Sliders"", ""Once Upon a Time"", etc. But this episode was the first or at least one of and still the best.It was both slightly disturbing but at the same time fascinating and a bit funny as we see the alternate world where the federation is a proto fascist state that rules with an iron fist.We see that most of the characters we know are the reverse of their good natured selves. I really like the performances of the actors it really feels believable that this is what the characters would turn out had they gone to the dark side of the force.From Sulu whom is slimy and kinda a corporate weasel as he is finding an opportunity to shortcut his way to the top. We even see in one scene the evil version of Kirk whom is practically a power mongering blow hole, it was kinda funny seeing how he is just exercising over the top aggression and some of the things he says.However the highlight for me is seeing the evil version of Spock whom is surprisingly pretty much the same just on the other team, let alone that goatee. It makes sense since logic is neutral, it can work for either side as look as the system it works for functions. Spock we see him cold and calculating which makes him slightly menacing, however I don't feel he is fully evil but more of someone operating on a Gray level as he probably deep inside doesn't fully agree with most of the principles of the empire he serves but he serves it all the same because it functions because it provides order which deems it a necessary evil.I really like the reactions of Kirk, McCoy, Scotty, and Aurra in this alternate world, their sympathetic because we're in the same boat as them as we're trying to make sense of the world their in. And their as disturbed as we are as they see how corrupt the world is along with the corrupt side of their counterparts, in their point of view it's as if they might have walked into Hell. It's also a really dangerous world as we see the way to get promoted is by assassination, in a way you can say it's an extreme version from what goes on in the corporate world and some of the underhanded tricks some dishonorable and dishonest employees utilize to get promoted or up in the corporate ladder. So, yeah you might want to think twice about having a career in this version of Starfleet because it can be a short one.The fight against the evil Spock was solid, he's a tough honcho to physically beat as we see him throwing Ahura, Scotty, McCoy, and Kirk around. It's sort of a fan dream come true as you might wonder what would happen if any of these characters got into a fight with him.And I really like some of the final minutes as Kirk gives food for thought for the evil Spock on his perception of the world they visited and on the possibility of making it better. From seeing how despite the little time the evil Spock along with the girl whom helped spent with Kirk it really affected them both and helped them see that another way is possible and can exist.In a way this episode really has a good message that one to few people really can make a difference but also that things can be better as long as possibility exists.As an old saying goes, life is full of possibilities.Rating: 4 stars",10
19,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Mirror, Mirror (TV Episode 1967)",An introduction to the mirror universe,"In the opening scene a landing party which consists of Kirk, McCoy, Scotty and Uhura are unsuccessfully negotiating with a race of pacifists; they refuse to allow dilithium crystals to be mined in case they are used violently. They state that the Enterprise could take them by force but Kirk states that they won't do that. As they beam up there is an ion storm that effects the transporter; instead of finding themselves on the Enterprise they know they materialise on a ship that is almost exactly the same yet somehow totally different; this is no ship of peaceful explorers; they are part of a brutal regime where failure is punished severely and promotion is secured by assassination. In this parallel universe the crew of the Enterprise has orders to destroy the inhabitants of the planet if they refuse to allow mining; something our Kirk won't do. He and other members of the away team will have to be very careful if they are to avoid being captured before they can figure out how to get back to their own universe.This is a classic episode that serves to introduce us to the parallel universe; a universe that will be visited more than once in later 'Star Trek' series. It is immediately apparent that the Star Fleet in the parallel universe is an organisation with fascist tendencies which immediately raises the tension. The fact that the villains have familiar faces serves to make it even more interesting it is also interesting that this Spock is just as logical as his 'good' counterpart. The cast do a fine job, especially the ones playing their evil counterparts; I particularly liked George Takei's portrayal of the thoroughly unpleasant Security Chief Sulu. Overall this is one of those episodes that no fan of the series will want to miss in fact even those who prefer the newer versions of 'Star Trek' should find this one is worth watching for its introduction to the mirror universe.",9

Because the actors who play evil members of the Enterprise crew in the ""other"" universe have so much fun doing it, especially George Takei as the scar-faced ""Security Chief"" Sulu..you can tell he's having the time of his life (Takei once said that this is one of his two favorite episodes). There's also a great guest appearance by the babe-licious Barbara Luna, who's both alluring and sassy as Kirk's mistress. There are two constants at work in this otherwise upside-down universe: Spock, who is every bit as logical and honorable as the Spock we all know..only with a beard. Then there are the peace loving Halkans, who will not allow either the Federation (in one universe) or the Empire (in the other) to mine for their dilithium crystals, even if it means their whole race will be wiped out. Kirk's in a real pickle, because in this universe, civilizations who don't bow to the Empire are destroyed and plundered. Kirk has to figure out a way to keep the Halkans from getting annihilated while at the same time find a way for him and his party to get back home, and he must do this without getting killed, for in this universe it's both legal and encouraged (as in going up in rank) to assassinate captains who disobey orders of the Empire.",9

In some of my prior reviews I've mentioned how Uhura's skirt kept getting shorter over the series' run, and I had to chuckle here. Since it couldn't go any higher, she gets to bare her midriff for an even sexier display. Nice abs too.I think the thing I liked best here was the way Spock's character was written. There's something to be said about his intense loyalty, no matter what side of the cosmic highway he was working on. Nice touch with the beard too.Too bad some more time couldn't have been spent aboard the real Enterprise exploring the nature of evil Kirk and company. There again, Spock had things under control and in lock down mode as soon as he saw something amiss.But the thing that gets me with these stories is why it's never explained how one's clothes get altered along with the big switcheroo.

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. Unlike any other hit series, it only has 3 seasons so luckily it means that they will be covering up all their ideas within it until they are satisfied. As it often happens, the first season is always promising and has potential (or else it won't lift up for further more seasons) in it and is utilized with fine detailed work like focusing on different new breeds and characters bonding through this journey.Whenever a crisis is created due to technical errors things do spice up especially if it results into two friends against each other.

0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Apple (TV Episode 1967)",Paradise with Killer Plants and Exploding Rocks,"This reworking of the Adam & Eve/the Garden of Eden story on another planet, along with the theme of population control, ends up being representative of the many things the original Trek series is known for. It almost seems that the writer took many of those Trek-like elements we've become acquainted with throughout the first season and simply plugged them in here arbitrarily: the numerous red-shirts, the stagnant culture ruled by a machine (""Return of the Archons""), a steadily-worsening threat to our beloved Enterprise, a return-to-nature scenario and a convenient disregard for the Prime Directive. But, it's probably the issue of the doomed red-shirts which dominates - if one had to pick that one episode which illustrates the original Trek's approach in terminating the careers of Starfleet red-shirts - this is the ultimate episode in that regard. Check out that huge landing party in the beginning - nine personnel! It's so big, it takes two beam downs. Why is it so big? Because there are four - count 'em 4! - red-shirts in the party. Get ready for some heavy-duty whittling down of a landing party.Yes, this is probably the episode from which sprang much of the legend, amusing as it is, about how you shouldn't wear a red shirt when beaming down with a landing party. And, I'll have to say, each one in this story meets a creatively different demise. Unfortunately, or amusingly (depending on your mood), this episode also began a trend of unintentionally amusing episodes - case in point, ""Catspaw"" coming up soon. Though the 2nd season contained more entertaining episodes, in quantity, than even the first, it also had more with those awkward weaknesses that leaned towards silliness, whether due to the writing, directing and/or acting. Shatner began to seriously overact around this time - he wasn't always hamming it up as many might misremember - he hardly ever did in the first season. So, while we felt for him every time a crewmember was killed in older episodes, here there's a tendency for viewers to want to chuckle (the first doomed red-shirt gets it via a plant; Shatner: ""What'd somebody say?... That...Paradise!..must've looked like this?!""). Oh, that angst!The other weakness here is a rather truncated feel to the writing - many questions remain unanswered by the end. Why would there be land mines as rocks, for example, scattered around an otherwise idyllic world? OK, our god-machine might have placed them there against, what, visitors from space (red-shirts from space)? And exactly who or what is this Vaal? How did it come to rule over these villagers? What do they feed it? It looked to me like they were carrying typical food down into the bowels of wherever Vaal resides. How would a machine gain sustenance from such food? It just seems that much of the plot points are arbitrary, like the threats - presented merely as a means to kill off red-shirts in various manners. This episode does contain one of my favorite melodramatic proclamations from Scotty: rather than just telling Kirk he can't beam the party back up, he stresses that not even a fly could be beamed up! That surely gets the point across!",6

Clearly, Chekhov doesn't give a rat's a** about his fellow crewmen! Wonderful stuff...Speaking of blonds, the Enterprise crew comes across a tribe of extraterrestrial, tanned Swedes. This tribe gives us unusual insight into why the birth-rate has been so low in Sweden: making kids is prohibited. However, there is an essential factor that separates the Scandinavian Swedes from these: the Space Swedes do not even have sex! As for why they're so tanned, I have no idea how a perpetually red sky affects the skin-tone, but even if it doesn't, one can always argue that the tribe goes inside the lizard cave for their daily dozes of tanning; I'm quite sure there is enough space there for a solarium.If the lizard-cave, Val, is a machine and not a Kilmer then why does it require human food to be brought to it as energy? Should it require oil or something like that? It's also never explained how the machine got there in the first place. Hence there was no reason for Spock to even bring up the infamous Non-interference Directive; evidently someone had already tampered with the Swedes. This directive is the single-most broken rule in Starfleet, methinks.Spock gives a cringe-worthy speech, filled with barely concealed bitterness, about mankind and their violence. Apart from this illogical attack of emotionalism from him, Spock also inexplicably quotes the Bible - Genesis, to be exact. He talks about the forbidden fruit and all that jazz. Surely Spock, an unemotional scientist, has to be an atheist and as such must realize that the Tree Of Knowledge story represents every religion's opposition to man's scientific and cultural progress.But I'm ranting now. After all, this is only Star Trek.TA is a typical ultra-cheesy ST episode, hence a very good one. People whine about Kirk's supposedly atypical behaviour, about the clichés (yet another God-like being that needs to be disposed of), etc, instead of focusing on the wonderful reddish look of the planet and the cheap sets. I've always preferred the interior, obviously fake sets as backdrops for the action, as opposed to on-location filming.",
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Apple (TV Episode 1967)",Pretty weak,"After a fairly strong start for the second season (""Amok Time"", ""Who Mourns for Adonais"", and ""Mirror Mirror""), this clunker came along. Mostly a silly retread of previous story ideas.Basically, the Enterprise crew are exploring a planet which seems idyllic, but turns out to have deadly plants and explosive rocks (for no good reason; why are there deadly dangers in paradise??), as well as a simple native race that worship a sophisticated machine they don't understand and deify as an entity called ""Valla"". Valla's story is never really explained; it inexplicably provides for the natives' needs while needing periodic 'feeding' for some strange reason. Valla basically serves as a plot device to temporarily disable the Enterprise and place the ship and crew in mortal danger (yet again). Valla's oddest shtick is its ability to control the weather and direct deadly lightning bolts at ground targets. Kirk's dilemma is to take out Valla and free both his ship and the natives from their seemingly benevolent dictator.Not much different here than in ""Return of the Archons"", which had a very similar theme. Slightly better resolution than in that episode, though, where Kirk lamely used ""superior human logic"" to ""trick"" the machine into destroying itself. Here, the machine puts up a better fight but goes down to the Enterprise's focused attack.Some mildly amusing silliness here about the natives' ignorance about physical love, inspired by Chekov's cute girlfriend, played by Celeste Yarnall.This episode does have some minor significance, as I believe it is the first episode in which the Prime Directive is mentioned (though I think it's referred to as something like 'code of noninterference'), which I don't remember being mentioned in ""Return of the Archons"".",3

The Enterprise happens upon the planet of Gamma Trianguli VI, which resembles what some would say is like the biblical garden of Eden. Spock, Kirk, McCoy and a small landing party beam down to meet the inhabitants and inspect the planet. They are followed by Akuta a man who is the eyes and ears of Vaal. The people of Vaal must keep Vaal fed and in return it is said that Vaal makes the fruit on the trees, the sun to shine and the rain to fall. Vaal also controls and rules over it's people not allowing love, touch or children. Vaal is also holding on to the Enterprise, draining all power sources and not allowing the landing party to beam back aboard the ship. The landing party must find a way to get back to the ship but in order to do that they must conquer Vaal and in doing so they free the people Vaal.This episode is a biblical reference to the garden of Eden and the story of the apple.Not a bad episode but I do have one question: how on earth did Spock break that rock without it exploding? When he threw the unwanted piece it hit the ground and exploded. Later on, one of the red shirts stepped on a rock and it exploded. I guess Spock really does have the Vulcan touch. lol.7/10",7

One crewman is killed by the spores of a plant, another is struck down by lightning, a third steps on an exploding rock. The people of the planet, known as Vaalians, live in peace and good health under their god Vaal, an ancient computer disguised as a statue of a dragon-like creature. The Vaalians sole purpose is to worship and feed Vaal. Meanwhile, Vaal has a tractor beam slowly pulling the Enterprise down to the surface, jeopardizing it and the crew. The landing party must figure out how to disable the machine to save the Enterprise and free the Vaalians. This episode stuffs more Star Trek tropes into it than it can handle. There's a robotic overlord, red shirts are dropping left and right, the Enterprise is on the verge of destruction, it's all a bit much. How many races can Kirk free from computer overlords in a 2 season span? The answer: a lot.

It soon becomes clear that it is a dangerous paradise as a crewman is killed by darts fired from a poisonous plant. Soon more dangers emerge; rocks that explode like landmines and lightning that strikes with deadly accuracy. Their mission is to contact the natives and they do that when they catch one observing them. He is a strange individual with antennas behind his ears; he explains that these are because he is the 'eyes and ears of Vaal'. It turns out Vaal is a computer they treat like a god; it regulates the planet to such a degree that the natives don't appear to age or have any need to reproduce. The away team are initially welcomed but when Vaal judges them to be a danger he orders them killed! To make matters worse the Enterprise is caught by what appears to be a powerful tractor beam and if Scotty doesn't think of something it will burn up in the atmosphere.From the very start we can guess this planet will be far from a paradise as well as Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Chekov the away team includes no less than five red shirts; four blokes who are destined to die and an attractive blonde for Chekov to behave inappropriately with! As other reviewers have said the natives look disturbingly like tall Oompah-loompahs making it hard to take them seriously and we never actually see Vaal; both details that detract from the story. The conversation about how any natives who die in accidents would be replaced if they didn't breed was more cringe-worthy than amusing but not as cringe-worthy as Chekov's behaviour with the blonde red shirt. On the plus side it was nice to see Kirk worrying about the possible consequence of his decision not to leave the planet after the first death and his threat to fire Scotty if he didn't save the ship was rather amusing. Overall a somewhat weaker than average episode saved by the unintentional laughs provided by all the dying red shirts!",7

There's a landing party that gets mixed up with natives, and to save his crew Kirk has to take drastic steps to alter the course of their civilization. There's a lot of romance in the air, (though interestingly, no romance for Kirk.) There's plenty of time for Spock and McCoy to debate concepts like free will, change, and material comfort versus freedom. And of course, several red-shirt crew members are killed along the way. There's a big fight and plenty of storms and lightning.As other reviewers have pointed out, this episode deals in themes that are handled much better in later episodes like ""A Private Little War"" and ""The Paradise Syndrome.""

As you might expect, when there are numerous additional officers on the away team death is certain to follow. With Kirk's track record, if I was an officer I think I'd request another station beyond the Enterprise. Anyway, a flower shoots out needles that kill and rocks on the ground are explosive, with atmospheric conditions producing dangerous lightning bolts with murderous intent. It is all tied to an ancient power source from deep within the earth; a snake mouth with eyes and two front teeth statue is where people of the planet go to feed their god, named Va'al, also serving as an entrance to where its power source is located. Kirk mourns his fallen officers, mentioning his relationships to their families, and questions always following orders when it comes to exploring unknown worlds. He needs Spock and Bones to still his resolve. Added to his woes, Scotty, in the captain's chair, communicates to Kirk how Va'al has sent a tractor beam from the planet which is draining the ship's energy and keeping the Enterprise from beaming them up or leaving orbit! David Soul is mentioned as he was a member of this happy, subservient, eternally young (fit and healthy) group of hippy- stylized Va'al worshippers, with curly blond coifs (the women with long hair), orange-tinted flesh, flowery jewelry, and Hawaiian costume. Va'al sees the away team as a threat to its controlled, governed mini-society, requesting through the tribal eyes/ears to coordinate the people to kill them! Kirk punching that Va'al spy with him crying as a result, the idea that this being is a machine causing its people to thrive in healthy, never aging bodies in a perfect habitat but threatening anyone else intruding, and Spock surviving the flower needles while a redshirt doesn't have such luxury of different blood and physiology make for amusing results. The Garden of Eden references are loud with Spock even mentioning Genesis, but it does give way to the Vulcan's similarities to Satan as Kirk and Bones poke a little fun. The planetary jungle set is lush and green, making for an aesthetically pleasant location...but it is indeed quite dangerous. Spock has his troubles: not only the flower needles, but also suffering the effects of a forcefield around Va'al and a bolt of lightning which burns his back! Chekov flirting endlessly with the yeoman as Kirk gripes there's no time for it is quite ironic considering the captain always seems to make room for the ladies despite distressing situations. The Prime Directive requiring no meddling in the affairs of other alien civilizations rarely gives Kirk much pause when he sees progress in their evolving as a culture with freedom stagnant or deprived.

But watching them in series order a day at a time, one becomes acutely aware that a number of themes were recycled with some regularity. 'The Apple' reminds me a lot of the first season's 'This Side of Paradise', where the resident population has become accustomed to having all their needs taken care of at the expense of individual and societal growth. The story is particularly lazy in using an exact same plot point from the earlier episode, that of the spore shooting flower, and at the same victim no less - Spock.Given the setting, one can capably make the connection between the title and the Biblical tale of Adam and Eve, but if that was the intent, the story didn't do a very good job in explaining a lot of the plot flaws. No mention of the origin of Vaal, how the machine processes real food (a real head scratcher), and within the context of the Star Trek universe, how and why Captain Kirk sees fit to violate the Prime Directive. The one interesting tidbit I managed to pick out of the episode was Captain Kirk's comment to Spock that Starfleet Command considered their officers an investment. I actually stopped to think about that, since an Academy education would have to have been a sizable sum if an Ivy League school goes for upwards of forty grand a year today. You're talking a heck of a student loan program.",6
17,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Apple (TV Episode 1967)",vaal has forbidden this..,"Star TrekThe AppleA cultural hub and by far one of the most loved and respected tale, Star Trek is created by Gene Roddenberry who wrote this brilliant concept, ahead of its time and is probably why it still doesn't fail to entertain us after these many years. It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. After a good run on its first season, the second season has more expectations to fulfill and hopefully they will try to develop the character a bit more and focus on the relations between the crew members on the enterprise to blend in and communicate easily with the audience despite of just focusing on more mind-numb missions that sometimes feel like they are filling their time and work in.The Apple had a worn off concept and the cornered situation that they urge to create has now been used way too many times so it would be great if they come out with something new and on terms of character development there isn't much range offered to fit in such things.",

Example, red shirts die, and Kirk acts like a fool, questioning his decisions. Red shirts die, Cherkoff goes after the female officer. Red shirts die, Scochy asks Kirk if he can beam down and take a walk in the woods. This kind of nonsense cannot be acceptable.The acting overall is garbage. I suppose if the dialogue and plot was better the actors could have done a better job. The story has been told in other episodes, a computer/god controlling the people and the Enterprise is in danger. Even so, the set design was great. Even if the story was done before, they still had enough new material for entertainment. But somehow the people in charge of the dialogue was out to lunch, or was drunk/high.Forget nostalgia.

0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Doomsday Machine (TV Episode 1967)",Classic TOS War Story,"The Doomsday Machine is a war story at many levels. It is the story of war spun out of control exemplified by a self-sustaining ancient device which seeks, destroys and digests whole solar systems. It is a story about military conduct aboard Federation ships. And it is, of course, a parable connected to the development and proliferation of nuclear arms. Despite all this heady stuff, it is also one of the most suspenseful and driven episodes of TOS. It is remarkable that so many viewers seem to miss the obvious points made here now that we have deluded ourselves into believing that the bomb is no longer something to be afraid of.The plot uses a simple device - a large, impenetrable and incomprehensible rocky-looking cone with some form of bizarre and very powerful energy within it - perhaps one of the strangest and most alien space monsters ever construed. Two starships, one crew-less and crippled, and one experiencing a power-struggle involving a possibly insane commander must figure out a way to survive and warn star fleet as the 'planet killer' is just about to reach a system inhabited by millions of colonists.Marc Daniels' directing and an amazing performance by William Windom as Commodore Decker, CO of the Constellation, are highlights of this classic episode. The Norman Spinrad script is quite serious, but not at all heavy-handed, and the regular cast, especially Nimoy, also do outstanding work.",8
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Doomsday Machine (TV Episode 1967)",Moby Dick In Space,"For creating and maintaining sheer suspense, this is Star Trek's crowning achievement.A gigantic automated weapon wanders through the galaxy smashing planets to bits and consuming the rubble for fuel. The Enterprise tracks the path of destruction left by the deadly machine and comes across the wreck of the starship Constellation. Kirk beams over to find the ship completely deserted except for 1 survivor: it's commander, Commodore Matt Decker (William Windom in a vivid, absorbing performance). The traumatized Decker tells Kirk that when his ship was attacked by ""that thing"", he made the fateful decision to beam his entire crew down to the nearby third planet for safety. ""There is no third planet"" Kirk interjects. ""Don't You Think I Know THAT?!"" an emotionally crushed Decker responds. ""THERE WAS! BUT NOT ANYMORE!"" The machine attacked the third planet, killing Decker's entire crew.Kirk persuades Decker to beam aboard the Enterprise while he preps the Constellation for towing to the nearest space port. However, when the Planet Killer suddenly attacks the Enterprise the ship is hurtled off-course from the Constellation's position. Next, quicker than you can say ""Captain Ahab"", Commodore Decker seizes command of the Enterprise and it is here that the episode really takes off. As if the Planet Killer wasn't enough of a threat, Decker recklessly takes the Enterprise into battle against the seemingly indestructible super weapon. The other half of the story is equally engrossing as Kirk attempts to get the crippled Constellation moving again to come to the aid of the Enterprise.""The Doomsday Machine"" provides ""Trek"" with probably it's greatest non-speaking villain in the form of the mammoth Planet Killer. While the machine's odd cornucopia design looks a bit strange from the side, the ""mouth"" with it's interior lit by a vortex of coruscating energy makes for quite a frightening image, especially when it attempts to swallow it's prey (the Enterprise). Occasionally the perspective of the machine does appear to shift a bit; a shuttle craft appears far too large in relation to the machine to match Decker's description of it as having ""a maw that could swallow a dozen star ships"". However, one must bear in mind that this was a low budget TV show, and the fact they could pull off the effects as successfully as they did is still mighty impressive. The memorable score that accompanies any appearance made by the Planet Killer also does a tremendous job of enhancing it's awesome, menacing presence.Particularly impressive is how the script presents a first-rate villain in the form of the vast, robotic weapon. Then, it surprises us by turning the up until then sympathetic Commodore Decker into a secondary villain. His mad, vengeance-driven attempt to destroy the machine endangers everyone on board the Enterprise, leading to one the best scenes in the entire series when Kirk, still aboard the Constellation, orders Spock to ""Blast regulations!"" and relieve Commodore Decker before he destroys the ship. When Decker reluctantly surrenders command to Spock, he steals a shuttle craft and kamikaze-style takes it straight down the throat of the Planet Killer, thereby pulling off the hat trick of regaining the audience's sympathy with this act of sacrifice and atonement. The entire episode is so well written that one wonders why this was Norman Spinrad's only script for the series.Once again the great Marc Daniels was at the helm, proving he was one of Star Trek's very best directors. The climax has Kirk unable to beam off the Constellation which is set to explode when it enters the mouth of the planet killer, and the mounting tension in this well edited sequence is magnificently maintained right to the final frame. Little wonder this story was one of the main inspirations for the first ""Star Trek"" movie- although that big budget, over-long attempt never comes close to duplicating the level of excitement this tidy little episode manages to achieve. Some times less truly is more.",
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Doomsday Machine (TV Episode 1967)",Something Like the Old H-Bomb Used to be,"We're back to some overwhelmingly grim tidings with this episode, a jarring reminder that there are some very dangerous threats out there in space. In a way, this can be looked upon as a precursor to the entire Borg threat introduced on the TNG series; on that show, something like the Borg was needed to shake the Enterprise and the Federation out of their complacency - or, shake them to the core, as is done to Commodore Decker here. The actor, Windom, may very well have ended up with the single best performance, as Decker, during the run of the original series. His loss is almost unimaginable - his entire crew is dead, thanks to one wrong move on his part. He's a walking dead man during the course of this episode - it's easy to compare his character to Ahab from the famous 'Moby Dick' novel, and the monstrous killing machine here to the white whale. But, Windom brings something more to the part. He's compelling from start to finish and adds such startling nuances to an already deeply fascinating, dark character. Picture Kirk as slightly older, not so sure of himself anymore; add on devastating trauma and then complex psychosis composed of guilt, obsession, and suicidal feelings - Windom juggled all of these and more to great dramatic effect.The cosmic threat of this huge alien weapon, while exciting in itself, takes on a much more darker tone thanks to the presence of Decker on the bridge of the Enterprise. The whole plot seems to take a back seat, for awhile at least, to the strange, awful relationship between our psycho-damaged commodore and this unfeeling machine. Everyone else becomes an incidental side player to the conflict between these two, but, of course, it's Decker, in his insanity, who creates a relationship; he no longer sees it as just a machine, a programmed robot, but as his personal devil. And one definition of insanity is trying the same thing over & over, expecting different results, such as phasers penetrating impenetrable Neutronium. He looks around his new bridge, replacing the one he lost on the Constellation, and sees only tools for his use. It's one of many great moments throughout, and usually on that bridge. The entire episode seems to have benefited from everyone giving an extra effort - from the ruined exterior and interior of the sister starship to that good fight scene between Decker and the security officer (it appeared as if they really tried to suggest a futuristic style of martial arts not seen before). The writing, direction and editing are all top notch. Not to mention, Windom, as Decker, ends up with probably the best death scene of the entire series.",10

Made all the early cons, even had a silver & red car painted to look like the USS Enterprise,with ""NCC-1701"" painted across the hood!

It was not my favorite - the drama was a little too intense for a kid, a little scary to see an adult going to pieces emotionally.But I certainly remember the machine. The lack of sophistication actually made it seem more alien in my opinion. It was not a fancy effect, no bells and whistles - not recognizable as a ship or even an intelligent creation. At any rate, effective enough to instill fear of the unknown in this ten year old.Watching the re-runs over the years, I grew to appreciate the truly outstanding performance of William Windom as Commodore Matt Decker. This brilliant actor improved the ensemble as a whole, adding another layer of much appreciated complexity to a fight with a machine. He was not just another cardboard cutout bad guy for our heroes to knock over - his wounded agonized voice cut away at the concept that everything always turns out okay, the good guys always win.Anyway, last week I saw the episode again. Being an old fan, of course I knew what to expect. But this was different! The more I watched, the more I realized that something had happened - something wonderful! The scenes were brighter and clearer than I had remembered in years - everything looked like it had been filmed yesterday. And then the EFFECTS! I was almost in a daze - everything was so much better than I had remembered! The doomsday machine was incredibly enhanced - and the views in space of the star ships in action were far superior than anything in my memory. I had seen no announcements about a ""redone"" Star Trek, so it was a surprise to me.I did some research, and discovered the remastering project currently underway at the latest owner of the franchise, CBS Television/Paramount (search @ startrek.com for info). Let me tell you, I view this type of thing with a very jaundiced eye after George Lucas' ""improvements"" to his original Star Wars films, so in a way I was glad not to know before hand. In fact, I had seen a shoddy CGI enhancement of this very episode made about ten years ago, and it was definitely not an improvement.Well worry not, the work the CBS team has done is OUTSTANDING. It is an improvement in every way, and I am certain even Gene Roddenberry would agree. The enhancements are seamless and unintrusive, to the point where I was not quite sure what had been done, but I knew I was seeing new things. They have re-done other episodes also, but this episode is their tour de force (so far), because of all the space effects they had to play with.The team on this project claimed they were doing it with the fans in mind, and that fact is in abundant evidence. Congratulations CBS Digital! To any other Star Trek fans, old or young, see the newly remastered episodes, they are worth seeing again, I promise.",10
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Doomsday Machine (TV Episode 1967)",Remastered Doomsday Machine: Amazing Star Trek Episode That Can Stand Up to Anything Produced in SF Today Thanks to CGI,"If there was any Star Trek episode from the original 1960's series that would benefit from a CGI face-lift in the special effects department, it was ""The Doomsday Machine"". And now the hope has become a reality thanks to the new so-called ""Remastered"" editions of the series.The primary shortcoming between the original Star Trek series of the 1960's versus newly produced film and television Science Fiction, such as Star Trek: The New Generation/Voyager, Babylon 5, Independence Day, Star Wars, and countless others, have been the special effects. The visual effects of the original series could never top the CGI effects achieved today. But now this shortcoming has been eliminated with the Star Trek Remastered series; all of the exceptional Star Trek episodes can be viewed as if being seen for the first time with effects that match any SF being produced today. And with the enjoyment of the acting, the story, the characters, and the dialog that made the original Star Trek not only the best SF series of all time but one of the greatest shows ever produced for television, the experience is a wonder to behold.Overall the story and the acting of the original Star Trek's best episodes surpass most of the writing in typical SF produced in the 1990's and 2000's, and far more compelling than most of the spin-off series. The characters played by William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley still rank as one of the best character-actor combinations of any Star Trek series, and certainly of any SF series to grace the small or large screen. Although Shatner was probably the weakest of the three, the sensibility he brought to Kirk meshed well with his other leads, Nimoy as Spock and Kelley as ""Bones"" McCoy, who were without a doubt the strongest actors of the series and balanced-out the team.The Remastered Doomsday Machine is a case in point. ""Doomsday"" is one of the best-written and best-acted segments of any Star Trek series, be it original or spin-off. Norman Spinrad's compelling tale chronicles the USS Enterprise discovering a wrecked federation starship among space debris, the Constellation. (The original was unable to show any of the debris, and the wrecked ship looked like a small white plastic model.) The ship's demise was at the hands of a giant space weapon characterized as ""the devil...straight out of hell"" according to Commodore Decker, the last man aboard. As frightening as the Doomsday Machine was as shown in the original 1960's offering, the new Doomsday Machine as presented via CGI is a horrific wonder to behold; a behemoth the length of the Great Wall of China with a maw the size of Mt Everest that could swallow ""a dozen starships"". The artists that created the imagery did a tremendous job in maintaining the relative proportional sizes of the Doomsday Machine with the Enterprise and the smaller USS Constellation. At one point, the Enterprise appears the size of a flea as compared to the massive Doomsday Machine.Part of the compelling nature of Doomsday is not just the monstrous ""villain"" itself, but also the intense dynamism between the characters in which Commodore Decker (William Windom, in one of the best guest performances of any Star Trek episode) attempts to take over command of the Enterprise to combat the machine. Kirk, Mr Scott, and a handful of technicians are left stranded aboard the wrecked Constellation. When Kirk realizes Decker is jeopardizing the safety of the Enterprise to combat the nearly-invincible Doomsday Machine, he is horrified but unable to intervene, or can he? Kirk and Mr Scott work furiously to bring the Constellation back to life...On a melancholy note, James Doohan (Scotty), whose favorite ST Episode was ""Doomsday"" did not live to see the new remastered version. But I am certain he would have approved. All of the scenes with the actors are untouched and unchanged. In additions, some references in the dialog that indicate what's happening in space are shown with the CGI that were not present before. For example, after Kirk boards the Constellation and finds Decker, Kirk offers to tow the wrecked ship. The Enterprise is then shown towing the Constellation, which was never seen in the original episode. If you thought the original was good, the new remastered version is superb, and keeping with the spirit of the original. And when the Doomsday Machine makes its appearance, its design is fully based on the original, just a hell of a lot more terrifying! A tremendous Star Trek experience by any standard.",10
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Doomsday Machine (TV Episode 1967)",Superb Story of Obsession,"One of the other commentators described this story as ""Moby Dick"" in space, and William Windom makes a hell of an Ahab.The Enterprise comes across the remains of the U.S.S. Constellation, whose only survivor is its commanding officer, Commodore Matt Decker (Windom). Kirk learns that the crew of the Constellation, as well as the star system it was patrolling, was the victim of a large, cone-shaped, matter-sucking machine. Decker, overwhelmed with guilt for the loss of his crew and an obsession for vengeance, takes command of the Enterprise (while Kirk is trying to repair the Constellation) and attempts to destroy the machine.The key to this episode is Windom's superb performance, which is balanced against Nimoy's (as always) level-headed Spock and Shatner's sympathetic Kirk. The finale is also remarkably suspenseful.",9
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Doomsday Machine (TV Episode 1967)",One of the best,"One of the reasons the original series is thought of so highly is that certain individual episodes (City on the Edge of Forever, Journey to Babel, Balance of Terror and this one) are as good as anything you will see on movies or TV. This episode highlights some the things that made TOS great: Lighting, set design, and the acting. For all the grief Shatner receives as an actor, in this episode he really nails what makes Kirk a great captain. He is confident, forceful, able to think on his feet and fully in command. The color scheme, which employs bright primary colors, and the eye light they use on Kirk to highlight his sense of command are excellent. And don't forget the writing and directing that fully makes use of the tension inherent in the situation. You will never see a better straight ahead action episode on TV than The Doomsday Machine.",10

I first saw this episode as an 8-year old kid during the original NBC run and was just blown away. Even after sitting through the horribly ""edited"", after-school rerun version of this show many, many times, it still kicked ass! William Windom was great as the haggard, broken Commodore Decker and ""The Doomsday Machine"" has all the elements of the best Trek episodes: tight script, thinly-disguised references to 60's politics, self-sacrifice for the greater good, tactical improvisation under pressure, victory-snatched-from-jaws-of-defeat etc. etc. It just gets better with age! Hats off to all who participated in bringing this series back with updated FX - it looks great (new prints??). I'm sure it's close to what Gene Roddenberry might have done with the show way back in the day if he had access to all the modern CG bells and whistles...",8
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Doomsday Machine (TV Episode 1967)",One of the very best original Star Trek episodes,"After 'Mirror Mirror' this episode ranks as one of the very best Star Trek shows in the second season of the Original series. It is even better than 'The Trouble with Tribbles.' I just viewed a taped copy of it and the sci-fi work done here was incredible for a 1960's era show: you get to see the Enterprise's shuttle bay when Commander Decker exits the ship and unforgettable images of the Doomsday machine itself. NBC must have spent a ton of money on this particular episode.Kirk, Spock and Decker's performances here are superb as all three get their turn playing cat and mouse with a deadly planet eating machine. It flat out deserves a 10 out of 10 ranking in my view and should be among anyone's top 10 Star Trek picks. Scotty also has a starring role--saving Kirk's life at the very last minute. The only missing original Trek character is Uhura who was played by Lieutenant Palmer (the late Elizabeth Rogers) for this particular episode.",10
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Doomsday Machine (TV Episode 1967)",He Is Gone......,"The words from Mr Spock, ""he is gone"", though short, impacted a terrific dramatic moment in this episode of Star Trek, I place this episode as one of the best. Other great lines from Mr Spock, ""Vulcans never bluff"", and ""Mr Scott speed is of the essence"" yes there are those great lines, also the great dialog from Dr McCoy, ""Well do something Spock!"". Oh one note as I re-watch this, one of my favorite episodes, don't let Mr Kyle run the transporter controls! LOL. OK now that that levity is taken care of, William Windom steals the show as the starship Commodore who loses his starship and almost the Enterprise taking on the Doomsday Machine. Everyone has commented on the plot here, so some personal observations, we have a Lt Palmer instead of Lt Uhura here, I'm not sure it hurt the episode but I do miss Nicole Nichols, not sure the reason why but it did establish that a starship is full of many crewman. No Chekov either, he would have been nice to freak out at the proper moment, not that he would have freaked, the whole crew is very professional here, a rebellious Chekov on the bridge allied with Dr McCoy against the rouge Commodore would have been a nice touch.On another personal note, I went to a Star Trek Convention at the Hilton NYC in the mid 70's and heard James Doohan, when asked by a fan what his favorite episode was, say ""The Doomsday Machine""; upon which I jumped up applauding, by myself. Being that I was about 12-13 years old (unsupervised and paid my own way to get in because I was working at the time), I guess it wasn't embarrassing but looking back, oh my that is awkward, lol! I'm watching my Star Trek DVD's that I bought and realize that season two is indeed the best, it's a shame that the show didn't get better ratings as this is great sci fi, and great acting.LLAP",10
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Doomsday Machine (TV Episode 1967)",A Stand Out Episode,"This is my all time favorite original episode. In fact, I still have a copy of the script that I purchased from Gene Roddenberry's ""Star Trek Enterprise"" mail order company in 1969. Every time I watch ""Doomsday"" again, I leave with another perspective on what is going on in this action packed episode. What sets this episode in a class of its own is the deadly serious atmosphere from the opening teaser on, as directed by Marc Daniels. The script describes ""an air of tension on the bridge"" and ""the crew looks more haggardas if from prolonged high tension"". We see for the first time in a story, two armed members of security, ominously standing guard in the bridge with type-2 phasers visibly displayed. The cool and serious Lt. Palmer replaces the usually warm and expressive Lt. Uhura. Mr. Spock is even more serious and unemotional than usual and there are some very severe looking close-ups of him. When both Mr. Spock and Commodore Decker are seated in the captain's chair, most of the shots from the left side of the bridge show a bright red or orange backdrop behind them, as if the rest of the bridge does not exist for that moment. The entire episode is characterized by almost constant motion, such as the Enterprise moving through space, the Planet Killer in hot pursuit, the Enterprise peeling away, the Constellation jerkily moving, crews in both ships being thrown and shaking, the fight between Decker and the guard, etc. The phasers fired by both ships are different and this difference is not seen again. The beams are orange and the sound of them bouncing off the neutronium hull is awesome. Due to the constant and immediate threat, there are no debates, bridge crew meetings, or discussions aboard the Enterprise. Spock has to deal with two serious threats, the Decker threat of ""attempted suicide"", as well as the unstoppable and insatiable Planet Killer. Sol Kaplan's score is outstanding for its break with previous ST music with its jarring combination of brass, percussion and strings. I was glad to hear the Planet Killer's theme music used again in the companion episode, ""Obsession"", where Kirk faces another ""Moby Dick of Space"". William Windom's Commodore Decker is a guest star performance that sets it apart from others for its portrayal of an enormously guilt-ridden, broken, and tortured man. Mr. Windom carried out the script's description of Decker as ""grimacing in internal agony, lashing out"" to the letter. Unlike a typical episode, Dr. McCoy does not join Kirk and Spock on the bridge for some bantering during the prologue. Once Decker asks McCoy to ""leave the bridge"", the doctor is not seen again.Even though I had loved the first season of Star Trek, I remember that when episodes like ""Doomsday Machine"", ""Obsession"", ""The Changeling"" and ""Mirror, Mirror"" made their debut in the second season, I was in awe.",10

Kirk and Scotty are on board the badly crippled ""Constellation"" (a twin to the ""Enterprise"")and work on trying to restore enough power to assist the Enterprise. Meanwhile, on the Enterprise, Spock is in command and is left to deal with the Constellation's lone survivor, Commodore Decker (who is now on a personal mission of his own) and Dr. McCoy who (as usual) is challenging Spock's decisions.

Special effects bad--now with all the advances in FX but it does not take away in me how lethal it was (despite its ice cream cone, spyglass appearance) and besides the potential loss of life had it not been destroyed, what Starfleet's enemies got hold of it's technology. *Burr* The facet of the possibility Staffleet's known enemies discovering it never comes up but did it need need to? The simplicity of it's it or the universe is enough more than enough. Intense in all caps music, performances, pacing--And Never, after 40 years plus, has it become silly over time.This just might the episode that turned me into a Star Trek fan.",9
14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Doomsday Machine (TV Episode 1967)",One episode where everything comes together,"""The Doomsday Machine"" is the first Star Trek episode that I can clearly recall seeing, when I was six during the summer of 1970, shortly after the the show went into syndication. Interestingly enough, I was aware of this episode from about the time it first hit the network in the fall of 1967. My cousin, who is three years older than I, had seen the show and had constructed a homemade model Enterprise and Doomsday Machine. We had several battles, and I was always stuck being the planet killer.For me, this is just about a perfect episode, certainly the best of the bunch in my opinion. You start out with a great plot. The story comes alive in a great script. Excellent actors, especially guest star William Windom, give inspired performances. With the exception of the final shots of the Constellation going into the planet killer, the special effects are, at least in my opinion, terrific. There is great action, and there is a wonderful, feature film quality score by Sol Kaplan to tie it all together and add perfectly to the mood of each scene.Unlike some other people, I have absolutely no use for the new, ""enhanced"" CGI effects. I freely admit that I view these as akin to colorizing Casablanca, but beyond that, the quality of these is just plain terrible. Most of the new effects throughout all the episodes are more akin to what you would expect to find in a video game. They are not up to the quality of CGI in any feature film, and in my opinion aren't up to the quality of CGI in the average Sci-Fi network flick or series. But even if they were great, I would still be vehemently against them. The work done by Matt Jefferies, Wha Chang, the people at Howard Anderson, as well as all the others who were involved, was cutting edge for the time and deserves to be seen. Any work of art should be at least partly judged by the context of the time in which it was created. There is one effect that literally chokes me up every time I see it. After the initial commercial break, the action is rejoined with a shot of the derelict Constellation floating in space. This, combined with Kaplan's haunting but majestic music serves to remind the viewer of what has become to this once proud, powerful ship. I know that the model photographed was nothing more than an AMT Enterprise with some ad-hoc damage and re-arranged numbers with the Constellation name, but it is a deeply powerful scene.There is never a dull moment in the entire 48 minutes. As a kid, I had the entire script memorized and would often recreate the show with my own models. Fortunately, I eventually grew up and ""got a life"" as William Shatner once put it, but my love of the show in general, and this episode in particular, has never waned. A number of Treks, both on the original show and in subsequent series, have come close to the quality of this episode, but it has yet to be matched. If you have never seen an episode of the original Trek, this would be the one introduce you to the show. It's as good as they get.",10

Everybody else was just ok. There were better acted episodes. But the planet killer, what the hell is that?!One of my main problems with this one is why did Decker head into the Killer with the Shuttle Craft? What was the point? Also, the scene with Decker taking control of the ship was a decent idea, but McCoy not being able to certify insanity with test results did not work for me. The test is in front of you.

16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Doomsday Machine (TV Episode 1967)",well.. do something..,"Star TrekThe Doomsday MachineA cultural hub and by far one of the most loved and respected tale, Star Trek is created by Gene Roddenberry who wrote this brilliant concept, ahead of its time and is probably why it still doesn't fail to entertain us after these many years. It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. After a good run on its first season, the second season has more expectations to fulfill and hopefully they will try to develop the character a bit more and focus on the relations between the crew members on the enterprise to blend in and communicate easily with the audience despite of just focusing on more mind-numb missions that sometimes feel like they are filling their time and work in.The Doomsday Machine hits hard and fast keeping the viewers engage through the course of its runtime (which is extra in here) with gripping screenplay and fresh approach on the format that is unpredictable rather than what it usually walk on.",

You would think the alien race which built it would have made it look more like what it was (as in, oh, I don't know..a MACHINE. It could be a really MEAN looking machine!). OK, all kidding aside, this is one of Trek's best; a suspenseful thriller from start to finish. It's always unsettling when Kirk and company board a ship where the crew is either missing or dead. In the case of the ship in this episode, the Constellation, the only man left is the ship's captain (and Kirk's old buddy) Commodore Matt Decker. Decker has made a horrible error resulting in the death of his entire crew, after he beamed them down to one of the system's (temporarily) surviving planets in an ill-fated attempt to send them to relative safety (what made him think his crew had a chance against a machine that EATS PLANETS? Did it not occur to him that the planet killer might ultimately ignore something as small as a starship? It would definitely have occurred to Kirk).Our heroes have a serious dilemma. The planet killer's route takes it directly through the Rigel system, the most densely populated area of the galaxy. But there seems to be no way for one ship to fight it. Do they sacrifice the Rigel colony to get away from the sub space interference caused by the planet killer to warn starfleet command, or do they attempt to fight a battle they can't possibly win? Or is there a third option they haven't figured out yet (this is Star Trek, so of course there is)? The safety of the Enterprise doesn't matter to Decker, who's bound and determined to take the Enterprise into a suicidal battle with the planet killer. William Windom graces us with the best guest appearance ever in a Star Trek episode as the doomed Decker, a man with a death wish so strong he's willing to sacrifice Kirk's crew along with him (after using Star Fleet regs to forcibly assume command). It's fun to hear Kirk, after seeing his ship almost get swallowed whole, say to Decker, ""You mean you're the lunatic who's responsible for almost destroying my ship?!"" Decker redeems himself even as he sacrifices his own life, and Kirk and company save the day (naturally). The climactic scene as Scotty is attempting to beam Kirk back on board against a 30 second detonator timer on board the Constellation (of course the transporter is faulty) makes for some great edge of your seat suspense.",10

They tried to get him medical help, and contrary to Queeg, the Commodore doesn't ask for help.Great episode, fabulous acting all round.

This machine uses a pure anti-proton force beam to chop through planets or anything else in its trajectory. The Enterprise is in the vicinity when it encounters two solar systems that were victims of The Doomsday Machine, soon finding a derelict starship, The Constellation, adrift in space. Aboard is one man, Commodore Matt Decker (William Windom; in one of most memorable roles of his career), lost in a state of shock, soon coming to and telling Captain Kirk of what happened, describing to him the weapon that is destroying planets. Kirk will have Decker and Bones transport back to the Enterprise while he, Scotty, and a few crew members remain on The Constellation to prepare the ruined ship for tractor beam departure. When The Doomsday Machine starts its way to another colony of Starfleet planets, Decker will take Spock's command while Kirk and company remains stranded on The Constellation thanks to a transporter malfunction. Starfleet regulations allow Decker to assume command over the Enterprise, with Bones McCoy obviously vocally against it as is Spock (left in charge of the Enterprise by Kirk). Feeling guilty and responsible for the death of his crew (they were sent down to a planet destroyed by The Doomsday Machine), Decker will use the Enterprise as his tool of vengeance, putting those on board in danger. Perhaps through some drive and ingenuity, Kirk and Scotty can get the wrecked Constellation to at least move towards The Doomsday Machine, maybe even have a phaser bank to assist the Enterprise (that has been under attack by TDM after Decker has the Enterprise lead a strong phaser fire up and down its impenetrable shell) being pulled into the planetkiller. The battle of wills between a barely-held-together Decker and the logical, more realistic Spock is one of the many stellar aspects of this much-heralded classic episode of Star Trek. The suspenseful finale where the transporter beam is out of sorts with Scotty doing all he can to fix it as Kirk awaits rescue from The Constellation, as it draws closer to the inside of The Doomsday Machine, the warp engines set to burst, is another reason this episode remains such a highly regarded trekkie delight. Also seeing Kirk and Scotty trying to get a beat-up ship to at least operate is good fun. Especially memorable is Decker's ""last stand"", driving an Enterprise space shuttle right into the heart of his adversary. Kirk believes The Doomsday Machine was created as a weapon of war, a desperation machine used as an Armageddon mechanism to kill the enemy even if they themselves were defeated. Obviously drawing inspiration from the H-bomb attack (it is used by Kirk in comparison to The Doomsday Machine), this episode comments on the innocent that suffer because of a war they have nothing to do with, casualties of war, collateral damage. The idea that there might be another out there in space does make for a disturbing thought, with Kirk applying a ""hope not"" attitude most anyone would share.",10

It is a superb, tension-filled episode that features one of the best climaxes and one of the best guest starring turns of the whole series.William Windom is just great playing the traumatized Decker, a man who will risk the Enterprise to destroy the machine that killed his own crew. Check out how he seems about to emotionally disintegrate on the Constellation, then turns near-manic and determined as he sits in the captain's chair. And check out Windom's acting in the final moments of his sad personal suicide run toward the planet killer.The climax is a classic count-down to disaster that blends seamlessly with all the action leading up to it, and William Shatner plays the scene wonderfully, showing our confident Kirk feeling genuinely afraid as his escape from danger starts coming down to the wire. James Doohan and George Takei get to do excellent support work, too, and Leonard Nimoy gives us the best portrait ever of Spock as the calm second in command in the midst of a high pressure situation.My only quibble- and it's a matter of opinion only- is that the Decker character could have been a little better developed leading up to the moment he takes command of the Enterprise. Windom should have been given Shatner's ""doomsday machine"" speech from the Constellation's control room, and perhaps a little more interaction with Dr. McCoy about how he felt about losing his crew.

He explains that they were attacked by a huge device; as the ship took damage he beamed the crew to a nearby planet but that was consumed by the device! It is surmised that that it is some sort of doomsday machine that devours planets as a fuel source. While Kirk and Scotty lead a team that attempts to get the Constellation working Decker returns to the Enterprise. The device is then sighted; Spock prepares to move away so they can contact Star Fleet but Decker pulls rank and orders the ship to attack the device an attack that does no damage but does make the device target the Enterprise.I first saw this episode as a young child and clearly remembered the long cylindrical device. The design may be simple but they it is still effective enough to make it menacing. That effect is helped by the fact that we know almost nothing about it; we don't know who made it, why they made it or where it came from it just is. Things are helped further by a great performance from William Windom as Commodore Decker. He perfectly captures his obsession with avenging to loss of his crew, for which he blames himself, without making the character too unsympathetic. As the story progresses the tension rises nicely; even the final scenes succeed in being exciting despite the fact that we know that there is no way Kirk is going to be killed off!",9

Kirk on the other hand is looking after the safety of his crew, so from the start, the two groups of explorers are at cross purposes.But these two visitors are not united in their own purpose - Korob (Theodore Marcuse) appears to be a Wizard with a cat who is his Familiar- But he himself seems to want to bridge the gap of darkness, he seems to want to DO the thing he was sent to do. But his ""familiar"" Sylvia (Antoinette Bower) who appears as both Cat and Woman - Has had a jolt of power - An Inoculation, and is only interested in the expressions of using POWER, gaining even more power, and abusing sensations.In fact it has totally taken her over. Their ability to manipulate their surroundings, to create a castle with a dungeon, to make illusions of Ghosts - Stems from two artifacts: the Transmuter that Korob wields and the Crystal which Sylvia wears - Both together are creating this Haunted House, and taking over the minds of the Enterprise Landing Party.Sylvia explains this to Kirk as being ""Sympathetic Magic"" - And she gives the textbook definition in this episode: She made an image of the Token Redshirt Victim (Crewman Jackson, Jay D Jones), and wished the image dead: And when she believed the image was dead, Jackson died. This is in fact the very way this type of magic works according to all of the literature about it.Using Sympathetic Magic, they first heat up the Enterprise, then they encase it and trap it- And it so happens.So what could have been a chance for Kirk to meet some very unusual Aliens- Of a type that in Trek had never before been shown - All communication breaks down instead. Sylvia wants what she can't have and what she should not even be wanting, and this sets Kirk into Defensive Mode. Sylvia goes on a rampage, and kills Korob. But not before he shows Kirk that the wand he carries around is the amplifier for the magic Silvia wields in her crystal. With that fact, Kirk is able to dope out that if he were to destroy it, Sylvia would lose all of her ability to make her illusions real.And she basically backs Kirk into a corner, with no other way to reason with her, he has to take drastic action.If only more about these aliens could have been revealed - These weren't just more Humanoids in a galaxy full of humanoids, they were totally strange. But Kirk met them, and they, unfortunately, met Kirk. And so in the corner of our minds, where things we don't want to remember reside, where shadows creep and unmentionable things happen, in nightmares so dark that Midnight is like noon, Sylvia and Korob met Kirk and Spock, and then in their natural forms, met death - Their lifeforms were so unusual that nothing could have prevented them from turning into smoking goo.And as Sylvia and Korob were wriggling in the poisonous Oxygen, they returned to their very Pear-Like appearance, and then melted, like all witches eventually do.",10
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Catspaw (TV Episode 1967)",Silly but Nevertheless Interesting Halloween Episode,"Holy space-cows what a mess! One of James Pevney's relatively weak early efforts was this Halloween episode of TOS - complete with black cats, witches, zombies, skeletons, dungeons, and magic wands. In retrospect, Catspaw (especially the not-so-special effects) is laughable, but not entirely without merit. Shatner and guest stars Theo Marcuse and Antoinette Bower have some great scenes. Sadly, the very talented Marcuse passed away a month after this episode was aired. Had he lived into his 50s and 60s, he could have become the 1970s and 1980s Vincent Price.An away team suffers a casualty and a few missing crew members, including Sulu and Scotty. The holy trinity (Kirk, Spock and McCoy) beam down to investigate. On the planet's surface, they quickly encounter a trio of ghosts, a medieval-looking castle, and a black cat. Kitty leads them to a trap and they wake up chained up in a dungeon.Some would say this is all pure schlock, but there are a few aspects of Catspaw that make it worth seeing. As I have mentioned, some of the acting is quite good. It's also worth thinking about the ambiguity of what goes on in the episode. On one hand it comes off as just another omnipotent alien episode, but these aliens are pretty different, and its not clear how much power they really have outside of their own minds and the minds of the Enterprise crew. Unfortunately, though these ideas are raised in the episode, they are also inadequately explored in this straightforward goth adventure story.",5

They find a strange misty world and are once again warned to leave; this time by what appears to be the three witches from 'Macbeth'. Again the warning is ignored and they proceed to what appears to be a medieval castle. Here there are captured and chained in the dungeon. They soon learn that Scotty and Sulu are under some sort of mind control. Their 'hosts' are a man called Korob and his cat; with which he apparently talks. Strangely just as the latter leaves the room a woman, Sylvia enters. It becomes apparent that everything they see is due to the aliens tapping into their subconscious minds and creating the world around them. These are more than illusions though and the threat extends to the Enterprise. The aliens have never experienced anything like it and Sylvia enjoys the sensations in a way that makes her dangerous.This is a fun episode which is helped by the improvements to the special effects in the remastered version. The world we see deliberately uses horror movie clichés like the swirling fog, the Gothic castle and even a dungeon to create and entertaining story. Antoinette Bower and Theodore Marcuse do a decent job as Sylvia and Korob; I particularly enjoyed the formers attempts to seduce Kirk to her cause. The finale with the cat was entertaining but not particularly frightening; even though it was meant to be large and scary it still looked like a typical pet cat. Overall a decent enough episode; not a classic but not bad either.",7
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Catspaw (TV Episode 1967)",Beautiful Black Cat,"I am a fan of black cats. I have had 3 of them. I believe them to be most beautiful. I really enjoyed this episode partly because of it having a black cat. I also liked how Korob would listen to the cat meow and then translate for everyone what it had said. I could usually tell what any of my cats wanted but to be able to know for certain and be able to actually understand what they said would be awesome.As they were all coming out of the dungeon, Kirk, Spock and Dr. McCoy start to fight Scotty and Sulu and suddenly they are in the throne room with Korob. I felt that that transition was seamless and I really liked how they were able to make it look like they were immediately transferred from one part of the castle to the other.I thought the episode was well done. It was very interesting how Sylvia (Korob's companion) used the miniature Enterprise, holding it over a candle and made it very hot inside the real Enterprise. Also, when Korob encased the miniature in lucite and that created a force field around the real one.I liked the castle interior. I thought it was done well. The costuming for Korob and Sylvia was also quite pleasing. (I can say that this was not the case with a lot of episodes. Even as a child I thought that some of the costuming was just plain ugly or way too off the wall.) There was a good dialogue between Korob and Sylvia as they were waiting for Kirk to be brought up from the dungeon. I liked how it showed that even though they were supposed to be working together, they were not in agreement as to how to achieve their goals. I really liked that whole scene. Where they come from there are no sensations and she is thoroughly enjoying experiencing all the new sensations available to her now. Of course, she is attracted to Kirk and he wisely exploits that to get the information he has been wanting from the beginning. That part was also done quite well and I felt the actors made it very convincing. She suddenly realizes that he is just using her and is not truly reciprocating the attraction she feels towards him. He gets sent back to the dungeon after that.Korob watched the whole thing and he goes and releases Spock and Kirk because he is really not liking what Sylvia has been doing. He also releases the Enterprise from its force field although they had been making strides on their own.They, of course, escape and manage to break the illusions that have been around them.And finally the end showing what Korob and Sylvia really look like. Fantastic! Very creative and unusual. However, the final part is a bit sad.",10
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Catspaw (TV Episode 1967)","Interesting episode, somewhat sexist.","The previous reviews pan this episode, and for good reason; it's somewhat campy, cliché and mildly unfocused. But, there is an underlined re-visitation of Hephaestus' and his wife theme operating here.We're treated to some tongue in cheek spookiness in the opening. Was it done intentionally? I'm not sure. There may have been a sincere attempt to create an atmosphere of horror, but it doesn't come off very well. Which may call into question the sincerity of the effort, but then one realizes that the lack of horror and fright is intentional because of the episode's primary focus.The astute classic Trek aficionado will recall the real chills delivered in the ""Wolf in the Fold"" episode, nor the scary tension of ""Dagger of the Mind"". The production team at Desilu was more than capable of presenting frights in the context of a Star Trek episode, so why wasn't it done here? One must keep in mind that the thrust of this episode is the unavailability of a physical reality to the antagonists. This is part of the puzzle. It is essentially both plot and theme.And here in lies another layer, and, perhaps, one that pokes fun at the material woman who marries a man for the riches he can garnish via whatever ability he has, and not for love. We're shown the material-girl in all her essence. Captain James T. Kirk takes a page out of the Sean Connery's James Bond, and gives as good as he takes from a woman who seeks more of what she already has, but who has sacrificed true emotional satiation for material gain. Kirk shows Sylvia her own folly, and the true value of her own worth and what he thinks of her.Sylvia invokes her wrath, but Kirk counters with Star Fleet training and his own patented Promethian approach to counter her attacks. Even at the moment of truth Sylvia cannot help but see an opening for gain. Even when Kirk tries to give her another chance, she is relentless in her pursuit of gain. A high tech grifter with supernatural appetites and abilities.It is fitting that both Sylvia and Korob are exposed for the weak transparencies that they really are. Perhaps a comment on true fear, and what really frightens us; not any manifestation of danger, but what we imagine might be the danger. It is in this vein that the scare factor is kept to a minimum to drive home a larger theme.The episode is not one of the more sterling in terms of production values, but it is worth a look. The closing SFX shot is somewhat fitting.Give it a shot.",
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Catspaw (TV Episode 1967)",Pay attention to the premise!,"If you understand the premise of this episode, that the black cat, witches, zombies skeletons, magic, etc. were derived from the aliens' mistaken interpretation of human nightmares, rather than human reality, then, this episode does make sense.In trying to understand humans the aliens tapped into human nightmares which evidently do not occur in the alien species. So, they present the Star Trek cast with these black magic nightmares, assuming they are part of the human paradigm.Still, it is done in a little campy, silly style which was common in the sixties. Nevertheless, I first watched this as a child and still love it. One of my big pet peeves about TV series is the lack of story diversity and I never felt that about Star Trek, this episode is a perfect example. Even as a child I understood that special effects in TV series was laughable (movies not much better), but I still dream of traveling the stars. The wonder of Star Trek and traveling is always meeting someone new and learning new things, it goes a long way to reducing bigotry and increasing compassion.",8
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Catspaw (TV Episode 1967)",Why All the Mumbo-Jumbo?,"This one's somewhat of an oddity among the Trek episodes of the original series, an episode cobbled together for no other reason than to fit a Halloween theme. There are no other reasons for its existence, no profound ideas explored, no stretching of the imagination. Bloch, the premiere horror writer of the time, penned the script (he also wrote ""What Are Little Girls Made Of?"" in the previous season). The paradox to this effort, though, is that there doesn't seem to be a sincere attempt to offer scares: the creators and actors approach this with a tongue-in-cheek attitude after the first and only death in the pre-credits sequence. This lightweight approach is most evident in the early encounter with the 3 witches: Kirk asks Spock for a comment; Spock's response, along with Kirk's and McCoy's reactive expressions, sends me into guffaws every time I see it - maybe the single most hilarious moment during the season (and that's saying something, as ""I,Mudd"" and ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" are coming up soon). Later, of course, we have the scene in the dungeon, when Kirk refers to 'Bones' and then notices the skeleton hanging nearby. BOO!There is, admittedly, a half-hearted attempt at exploring the conflict between physical senses and pure mentality. There is a tendency in the Trek series to depict aliens who hunger for the potential of physical sensation we human beings represent. Usually, such aliens may take human form temporarily, as Sylvia & Korob do here, and the new sensations corrupt them - apparently, only we humans can handle the, ah, sensuous nature of the ability to touch something or someone physically (see also the later ""By Any Other Name""). But, the episode never really makes it clear what these aliens want - all we get is the Halloween mumbo-jumbo: a foggy mist, the witches, a black cat, crew members turned into zombies, a dark castle with cobwebs and, finally, the warlock and sorceress with a wand. These aliens do prove to have impressive abilities, even by the standards of 23rd century technology, and it is explained that they tapped into our subconscious to produce this bizarre scenario, but otherwise, it's just those silly spooky elements interspersed amid a plodding storyline. There's a brief reference to 'the old ones' by Korob, the beings he and Sylvia serve, which conjures up images of Lovecraft, rather than aliens from another galaxy. The episode is capped by some of the worst FX, involving puppetry, of the series. This was, by the way, the first episode of the 2nd season to be filmed, and so is the first appearance of Chekov.",6

The aliens tap into very basic, primal fears, relating to the supernatural.Kirk, Spock and McCoy quickly realize that the aliens have potent powers of illusion and telepathy but limited firsthand knowledge of human culture or technology, which gives them the edge they need to prevail. I thought the portrayal of the true forms of the aliens, at the end, was among the most interesting in ""Star Trek""-- very different from the typical human-like and humanoid form.This was one of the rare episodes in which the initial landing party did not consist of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, but rather Scotty, Sulu, and several others. As a result, when Kirk, Spock and McCoy beam down, the officer left in charge is the Assistant Chief Engineer DeSalle, in what I believe was his only appearance. In other episodes, Scotty and Sulu had been shown as next in the chain of command after Kirk and Spock. I thought maybe Uhura would be placed in command, but alas it was not to be.",6

Might there be a take home message here? When seen from up close, the stuff you are afraid of ain't real. This was the ""Halloween episode"". One cannot help but be reminded of Dorothy, Toto, the Wicked Witch, and the Castle with the awful flying monkeys.The episode features a very similar castle.Our heroes beam down to a planet where a red shirt has died, and a couple of other crew members are apparently in trouble. A black cat appears, who does nothing special and who seems to take the place of a human actor requiring payment.Soon the cat morphs into an evil alien woman, power and ""sensation seeking"". To gain the upper hand, we soon have Captain Kirk ""kissing"" her. The scenes are shot to conceal the non-passionate nature of the kiss (ahem).Oh boy, this is straight out of popular 1960's culture, very dated and not at all scientific. Telepathy.The aliens are able to tap into subconscious fears. A ridiculous, fake looking wig on poor Walter Koenig to make him look like a Monkey, the band of the moment. Mr Spock doesn't know what ""trick or treat"" means. Engineer DeSalle on the bridge delivers his lines in such a perfunctory manner, that he should have his pulse checked. Sigh.

11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Catspaw (TV Episode 1967)","""Is it not enough to accept what is?""","In addition to the obvious Halloween theme, this episode borrows a page from 1942's ""Cat People"", both in form and content. The character of Sylvia (Antoinette Bower) hungers for the sensations that come with residing in a human body, and it was some of those same sensations, kept repressed, that made for the conflicted character Simone Simon portrayed in the Forties film.Considering that this Trek episode took place around the Thirtieth Century, I was surprised to hear Kirk use the term mumbo-jumbo to describe his reaction to the sympathetic magic tricks of Korob (Theodore Marcus) and Sylvia. I doubt that phrase would have survived a thousand years, much less Halloween, but that's probably being too nit-picky. Just in time to make the witching hour back in 1967, this would certainly have been a well received episode complementing the occasion.But Man Oh Man!, get a load of Chekov and his mop top! The camera brings his face and hair into full view close up and and even though I can't say this with any certainty, Walter Koening must have been a huge Beatles fan. In fact, he's almost indistinguishable from Davey Jones of The Monkees back in the day, their timing on the scene would have coincided precisely with Star Trek's original series run.For what it's worth, my opinion of the ending here was quite the let-down. For all their seeming powers of illusion, Korb and Sylvia turn out to be mere tiny blue fuzzies, dancing at the end of puppet strings! I have to keep reminding myself that this was 'Trick or Treat', with the viewer left to decide which one.",7

Today it would have wondrous SFX instead of just a few photographic effects of witches, people and things popping in-and-out and a giant cat. Disappointing to view because you are expecting so much more to happen, and it doesn't. The unknown ""red shirt"" crewman dying in the transporter in the first few minutes was completely unnecessary and almost ruins the ""fun"" factor of the cute (not great) episode. Killing off ""extras"" in the first five minutes was very common in many Star Trek episodes, all the way through TNG when they ""knocked-off"" Tasha, and thus the inside joke about being an ""extra"" on ""Space Quest"". Here, there is too much talk and not enough action. Even the scenes where The Enterprise is ""trapped in space"" on a neck chain has been done before.

Yes, I have seen every episode of every Trek series and all the movies, so I do have at least an informed opinion. But, because I hated STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE and STAR TREK V and loved STAR TREK II, III and others, you know my opinions can be trusted to be somewhat balanced. I think this makes me a big fan, but not a zombie-like person who loves and accepts everything provided it's Star Trek. I really think there are many out there that give an automatic 10 to anything Trek.Now this episode is the closest thing I can think of to a Star Trek Halloween special!!

Marcuse is first seen alone with a black cat, but the cat soon changes form and becomes Bower who looks and acts like a poor man's Joan Collins.This particular episode I thought was inferior.

16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Catspaw (TV Episode 1967)",Star Trek: The Original Series - Catspaw,"Sometimes a spade is a spade, and that goes for a bad Star Trek episode. Even the best of series has their dogs. ""Catspaw"" has Kirk, Spock, and Bones beaming to a planet to find the location of Scotty and Sulu after a third officer (this time not a redshirt) returns dead, with a ""curse"" placed on the Enterprise. The trio encounter a fog (which shouldn't exist according to Spock's atmospheric readings), three witch hag heads warning Kirk to go back to the ship, a cob-webbed castle, screeching black cat, and a bald *wizard* with the costume and scepter to match, complete with a throne, royal furnishings, master table for the great feast, etc. This wizard's black cat turns out to be his ""companion"" (or something to that effect), herself seemingly a sorceress with powers to use telepathy/telekinesis to alter matter into whatever form they see fit. Kirk will need to uncover the source of their power in order to rescue Scotty and Sulu (and eventually McCoy, too) from a zombie like hold that renders them puppets for the two alien mind controllers to do their bidding. Spock will try to assist Kirk in his efforts.Also included with all the Halloween ""trick or treat"" shenanigans is a dungeon where Kirk and Spock are shackled to a wall, with McCoy looking over to see a skeleton bolted the same. The plot involving aliens with powers to infiltrate the thoughts of humans and manufacture historical relics of the past is nothing new. I felt the spirit of Squire of Gothos in this one, except a Gothic aesthetic was applied, with Theodore Marcuse subdued and less inclined to torment and wield his power against Kirk and company. It isn't a showy part despite how he is costumedthat went to Antoinette Bower as the real antagonist who creates a miniature Enterprise and holds it under a flaming candle to prove a point to Kirk about the danger a wrong move by him might cost to others with fates in his hands. Unique chance to see Michael Barrier (as DeSalle) as the man left in charge of the Enterprise considering all the ranks before him were on the surface of the planet (very authoritative in his command, particularly tough on Chekov). Antoinette becoming beguiled by Kirk with him manipulating her into revealing how she is empowered might just irritate feminists everywherethat's par for the course as Kirk is the equivalent of Helen of Troy in male form when around the ladies. The reveal of what the two villains (well Marcuse actually sees how out of control and dangerous Antoinette has become, realizing she must be stopped) actually are once their illusions are gone is laughable puppet creations working as a death knell for the episode in terms of its overall quality. Every series of certain renown had its lemons, and ""Catspaw"" is the case for Star Trek. Seeing Kirk and Spock overcome attacks from Zombie Sulu, Scotty, and Bones gives us some fighting action, but it leads to a giant cat and Kirk outwitting the unstable Antoinette who loves the human body she is inhabiting with all the sensuous and greedy qualities that come with flesh and blood. Not surprisingly, this does have its fans, but when you watch ""The Doomsday Machine"" and this afterward, the quality certainly falls off when the two are compared. Antoinette is having a grand old time, though, and is indeed fun to watch, but how the episode makes her such a foil for Kirk to humiliate, her character is rendered quite a fool. Spock mentions ""bad poetry""...it could be applied to this episode. Sadly, Richard Bloch wrote this misfire.",3

It has dueling wizards and goofy magic. It is often thought of as a terrible movie. Put aside this episode, it looks like ""The Godfather.""

They encounter two humanoids with telepathic powers that have created a medieval aesthetic on the planet with their own castle. They have placed Scottie and Sulu under hypnosis and grill the crew on what it is to be human, to have science, and to have sensations. Kirk is able to pit the two creatures against each other and escape with his crew intact, destroying the illusion that the two creatures had created for themselves and causing them to perish in the process.If you can't tell from my lackluster episode summary, I wasn't too big a fan of this episode. I enjoy the concept of an alien lifeform being infatuated with the sensations that humans possess but this script does a poor job of doing anything with it. Neither character seems very developed and the lack of substance to them does not work in their favor. The only thing of interest from this episode is that it's Chekov's first appearance if you watch the show in chronological order. Besides this, there's not too many tidbits of interest. I did enjoy a few shots from the show, specifically these odd close-ups of Korob that appear a few times as reaction shots. They almost act as 4th wall breaking shots as Theodore Marcuse is practically staring down the lens of the camera. It's a bit of an oddity that I've never noticed/seen in previous episodes.

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. After a good run on its first season, the second season has more expectations to fulfill and hopefully they will try to develop the character a bit more and focus on the relations between the crew members on the enterprise to blend in and communicate easily with the audience despite of just focusing on more mind-numb missions that sometimes feel like they are filling their time and work in.The plot takes too much time to set it that before you know it, the first half of it is chewed off by the writers in order to just fill in their time but fortunately the second half is worth the stretch especially when the politics kicks in no matter how much familiar or predictable it be.",

This is one of those intentional comedies from Trek, like the later ""A Piece of the Action"" and, of course, the popular ""The Trouble With Tribbles."" The absurdities begin early on in a rather subtle manner. We last saw Mudd a year earlier, in ""Mudd's Women."" Since then, he'd found himself on the run after pulling one of his scams and, ship damaged, lucked onto this planetoid of obedient android servants. Sometime after that point, the android Norman managed to somehow become a Starfleet officer and came aboard the Enterprise a few days before the episode begins. I suppose nothing is quite beyond an android's formidable abilities if he/it puts a mind to it, meaning an adjustment of computer records or something, but Starfleet and the Enterprise crew seem very blasé about requirements for being on board, as if anyone in a proper uniform can stroll in if they felt like it. No futuristic versions of X-Ray machines, no screening methods like we have at our airports now? All Norman has to do is avoid a medical exam by McCoy for a few days.Anyway, that's the beginning of Kirk's troubles in this episode. This may be the only original episode to bring back a major guest star for a 2nd go-around. The actor Carmel is as hammy as ever as the scoundrel Mudd, turning out to be a good foil for Kirk, Spock, and all the regulars - sort of an original Trek version of old home week. Mudd seemed out of place in his previous Trek episode but someone got the idea he'd provide decent fun in some calculated amusement - and they were right. And there's more for the regulars to do in this one than is usual: Scotty, Uhura and Chekov get to ham it up a bit almost as much as the main trio. The last act of this episode sort of has to be seen to be believed - the closest we'll ever get to 'Trek on acid' - and it was a bit risky as everyone could have made fools of themselves. Shatner was always even more adept at comedy than drama, so this was a natural for him, but all the others appeared very relaxed in their turns at bizarro behavior. Nimoy as Spock, of course, had to resort to a more dry sense of comic timing, but he also made it work. A very nutty flavor to this one, especially in the 2nd half, and we get to enjoy it. Take note, also, that the Norman android has more than a passing resemblance to Data of 20 years later on the TNG show.",8

Most recurring characters were red-shirts, but Harry Mudd was one of the few exceptions, and to an extent set the standard for the later tradition of popular recurring guest stars (perhaps the most celebrated was DS9's Garak). The late Roger Carmel, in his mid-30s, made Harry Mudd a stand-out character. But the episodes in which the character appeared are, unfortunately sub-par. Carmel was, literally, a big presence in 1960s and 1970s TV talent - especially in the growing field of voice-talent. His neurotic, dastardly, and very funny way of ripping through and yet still over-dramatizing his lines was quite memorable.This time, the Enterprise is commandeered by an android named Norman, who just so happens to be a major player on a planet full of androids who lost their purpose years ago because their creators became extinct. So, they want nothing more than to serve, and imprison humanity in a combined utopian dream/dystopian nightmare. Harry Mudd, their first human, has been elevated to the position of a king among them, and, upon seeing his old ""friend"" Jim Kirk, he is delighted to share his newfound home with the captain and all of his crew, for the simple price of their freedom and ship.As others have pointed out, this is one of TOS' comedic explorations. As such, it's quite OK, but really nothing great. Mudd, his wife, and the androids are all funny in their own way, but unlike many similar episodes of TOS and later series in the franchise, the comedy takes the place of a coherent plot, and contradicts some of the socially progressive philosophies expressed elsewhere in the series. Still a good time, but not the best.",6
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" I, Mudd (TV Episode 1967)",Mildly amusing,"This was one of the only episodes that referenced another episode-- the first season episode ""Mudd's Women"" which also features the character Harry Mudd. The premise is that slightly charming rogue Harry Mudd has escaped his prior captivity and now has nominal control over powerful androids, created by some advanced race, which basically act like 'benevolent dictators'-- attending to human needs, but not allowing the humans to leave their presence. The Enterprise crew are their most recent captives, and Kirk's dilemma is figuring out a way to escape the androids.There were some decent comedic moments here, but I agree with one of the other reviewers that this episode uses, once again, the tired old shtick of ""using illogic against a computer"", which really wouldn't work. Basically, the crew start acting illogically, which somehow causes the androids to lose functioning because they ""can't handle"" the illogic-- which is really just the inappropriate anthropomorphic ascribing of 'emotional stability/sanity' to androids. This is comparably silly to thinking that typing nonsense commands to a computer would somehow destroy the computer. It wouldn't; the computer just wouldn't ""respond"" at all.The episode really doesn't amount to much. A mildly amusing diversion at best.",5

It's a silly enough concept when shows have the hero conquer the evil enemy by talking him into submission (as opposed to fighting him, trapping him, disarming him, etc.). It's even sillier when the enemy is a computer. Worse still, this episode marks the third or fourth time Star Trek has depicted this happening.Add to the weak plot the annoying, over-the-top, acting of Harry Mudd and failed attempts at humor (having a jerk for a wife is not funny - it's just sad), and you get one of Star Trek's worst episodes.",4

The outrageous one-liners and just plain silly behavior of the actors in this episode, and the Tribbles, and Piece of the Action, must have totally embarrassed them -- I'm embarrassed for them just watching it.Exception: Chekov, while quizzing the beautiful female androids, finds out that lecherous and depraved Harry Mudd programmed them for ""human female"" behavior.

In this one, the master swindler has escaped prosecution and landed in the lap of a planet run by computers (sound familiar?). He is treated like royalty because the robots want to study him. Unfortunately, they want some better subjects to explore and Harry hands over the Enterprise and its crew. Harry has been allowed to create robots as he wishes, and he produces five hundred slender, sixties looking women, with flashy clothes and big haircuts. There are also well built young men who look like personal trainers at a health club. They are all humorless and cater to everyone's needs. The only thing they cannot have is passage back to the ship. Their ultimate goal is to stock the Enterprise with these androids and go through space, showing everyone that robots are superior to humans. Mudd thinks he is going to go with them and the Starfleet crew has to stay. But they come to realize that Mudd is flawed terribly, and they never had any intention of allowing him to leave. Now he must ally himself with Kirk and the gang. What makes this so much fun is the idiotic (yet charming) way they attempt to thwart the androids. One mistake Harry makes is creating an android version of his nagging wife. He starts her up and she nags him. He then tells her to shut up, which is therapeutic. We find out later that this was a mistake. Of course, once again the crew is forced to outsmart a master computer. This will not be the last time.",7

Harry Mudd may have been mildly endearing in his first appearance (the slightly less-offensive 'Mudd's Women'), but in this encore he's basically unbearable. The plot is nonsensical, with an android taking control of the Enterprise and delivering it to Mudd's planet where the incorrigible criminal can exert his revenge on Kirk and his crew. And once again, the good Captain talks his way out of the whole mess by showing his intellectual superiority over scantily clad robot women that clearly weren't designed that well. It's no wonder this episode inspired endless parodies of the genre. Watch it once for context, then forget it ever existed.",3

I think this sequel was better than the one that Carmel did originally, Mudd's Women.The Enterprise goes into orbit around a planet with only one human life form that of Harry Mudd. The rest of the planet is composed of androids and remember this is before The Next Generation where Data would try to understand the human experience. These androids were built by a long dead humanoid civilization and the only human contact they've had until the Enterprise arrives is Carmel. As they say, he's flawed and even they know that.What they've collectively decided and it's a collective intelligence just like the Borg is that they should take the Enterprise and go back to Earth to serve man and create an orderly and logical society, one like the Vulcan. But even Spock sees some problems with them taking over.So Bill Shatner and Leonard Nimoy and the rest join forces with Carmel to defeat the androids. Their use of illogical behavior allows for some outrageous overacting that the cast thoroughly enjoyed because they looked it.But best in the cast is the Stella Mudd android that Carmel created so he could have the last word. She's played by Kay Elliott who has her career role in this. And you have to see how Shatner and the rest use her for a little final comeuppance for Carmel.Wonderful comic episode, a real classic.",9

The robots feel that the human race is very chaotic and must have the robots run their lives for their own good (they might just be on to something here). So, the thousands of robots are ready, willing and able to cater to the humans' every need.The problem for Harry is that although the robots had promised him that if he brought them many humans to serve, they would let him go, they reneged on their promise. Their actual plan is to take over the ship and spread order throughout the galaxy--since biological creatures are so inherently confusing and illogical.When this is revealed, Harry actually agrees to help the Captain gain control. What follows are some of the funnier and sillier moments in Trek history. Mr. Spock's expounding on logic, the game played with the invisible bomb and all the other stupid games they play to confuse the robots are pretty funny. However, what I really loved was the Stella robot and the wonderful way the episode is concluded. What a hoot!",10

With the exception of Mr. Sulu, all of the central characters were present on Mudd's android-inhabited planet and we therefore got to see quite a bit more variety than is usual in the ways the actors interacted with each other. From the beginning, with McCoy backtracking after insulting Spock to Kirk's ""translation"" of Mudd's carefully-worded lies to Mudd and Spock's numerous entertaining asides, the way this episode flowed was uncommonly well done. I always find the humor on this series quite entertaining (especially Spock's dry tone), but this episode was just one for the record books.

There's the oft repeated topic of Man potentially giving up his freedom and responsibility in exchange for harmony and having his needs completely taken care of. Not only that, but we've seen the resolution in action before as well, as Captain Kirk uses reason and logic to trip up the programming of his android captors. I guess one needs to focus on the fun elements of the episode and go along for the ride, especially when the Enterprise crew gets into their non-sensical horseplay to trip up Norman and the rest.I had to do a quick rewind in the early going in that scene when Norman (Richard Tatro) first came on board the Enterprise and started to take over the Engineering section. There's a red-shirt crew member who's presumably about to dive from the upper platform area onto Norman, but he's going in a direction AWAY from the android. Yet in the split second jump cut, he lands directly on top of Norman. Check it out.I have to say, Captain Kirk was pretty tolerant of old Harry when you come right down to it. You didn't come up with too many lovable rogues like Harry who could get away with calling Kirk names like laddie-buck. That's why I was a bit mystified with the ending, rather shocked actually that Kirk decided to leave Harry behind as a captive of the androids. It was all done quite amusingly with the sentence of dealing with five hundred Stella's, but somehow I didn't think it very sporting of old Jamie Boy.",8

When they arrive they are greeted by none other than the outlaw Harry Mudd. Questioning Mudd they learn that he wants the Enterprise and leave Kirk and all crew on the uncharted planet Harry named after himself. This planet is full of androids that serve Mudd.

When we last saw mudd he was running some weird space wife selling thing I guess which made for some interesting crew dynamics, however Harold was a largely unfunny and unimportant comic relief playing third wheel in an episode named after him. However here mudd drives the plot much more than the previous and traps the enterprise on a planet filled with androids. The pacing is great and the character drama of the enterprise crew attempting to escape as well as mudd's mischievous nature made the episode a thoroughly enjoyable one. The resolution here is a bit corny(plus it was sort of used in 'by any other name') but the concepts brought up are undeniably fascinating and really do the mudd character justice.",7
14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" I, Mudd (TV Episode 1967)",Having fun,"One of the reasons the original crew is so beloved is because of their comedic timing, and no more is that present that in ""I, Mudd."" Harry Mudd, one of the few TOS characters who makes a repeat visit, makes his second and final appearance of the show as the 20th century exaggerated chauvinist that represents a lot of what modern American males were like in the 1960's and is the precursor to our loveable big eared Ferengi. This episode is a fun and enjoyable ride that offers up a ton of humor and never takes itself too seriously.While on the surface this one appears as a sexist male fantasy commonplace in the era, it actually weaves its own path telling us that this fantasy is a pipedream that can never truly exist and humans are compelled by more than just their hormonal drives and impulses. Even Harry Mudd who exemplifies these virtues has problems living in this society where his every need and fantasy is provided for him, but this episode is not truly about dreams. It is about having fun and the way it is handled is superb. Sometimes original series episodes can be difficult to watch, but this one will have you laughing several times throughout and the ending, while possibly upsetting some feminist groups, is the perfect climax to an episode that never takes itself too seriously. So, whether it is Spock's illogical logic or Scotty's whistle phaser demise, there is something in this one that keeps you hooked and enjoying every minute of it.",8

Mudd explains that since his last encounter with Kirk he managed to escape prison and find his way to his current location where he ordered the resident androids to create more to his own specifications not surprisingly most of the models are attractive females. It sounds like paradise for a man like Mudd but he wants to get away. They however wouldn't let him leave to he arranged for them to get more humans to serve and study. Of course things don't go as he planned and he must join forces with Kirk and his crew if the androids are to be defeated.This is a somewhat mixed episode; it starts well and it was great to see Roger C. Carmel return as Mudd and his array of android beauties were rather fun I loved the scene where Chekov contemplates being with two such androids as he realises they were programmed by a man as depraved as Mudd! The episodes weakness is its use of that old cliché; causing a computer, or in this case the androids, to crash by behaving illogically or using a paradox some of the crew's 'illogical behaviour' is just embarrassing to watch. The episode is somewhat saved by the finale although many would argue that what Kirk does to Mudd could be construed as cruel and unusual punishment!",7

They will let him go but in return want to study and serve the crew of the Enterprise. While this place maybe paradise, Kirk must figure out how to get off this prison planet and back aboard his ship. Anytime Harry Mudd's involved, you know you're in for a hammy, silly episode! His mustache twirling can be a lot to handle at times but it at least keeps you entertained if the plot begins to drag a bit. This episode goes back to the well again regarding plots about outwitting the logic of computers. It's a well beaten path by this point in the ST-verse and this script does little to add new dimensions to it. The goofy antics of the crew to confuse the androids was cringe-worthy at times, the plot nonsensical. If Norman is the hub of the whole thing, how was he able to leave the planet for so long? He traveled light years away. Were the other androids able to function without him?Some of the goofy episodes are a lot of fun but that's not the case with this episode. It's slow and boring and definitely skippable.",4
17,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" I, Mudd (TV Episode 1967)",The Plot Hole Episode,"""Star Trek"" suffered from a budget that was too low for its genre, which, I assume, is the main reason for the poor writing that was heavily contaminated with plot holes, continuity errors, and pseudo science among other things. What made the series survive three seasons was that it was unique.As others have written, one must throw out one's sense of logic to enjoy this comedic episode. A few examples: Who built the first androids and what happened to them? How did Norman leave the planet? There was no mention of any other spacecraft. If there had been, Mudd would have lobbied to ""borrow"" it for his own escape. How did Norman appear out of nowhere and become assigned to a Federation star ship? While Kirk is trying to fry the androids' brains with logic, Norman states that he could not harm the humans he serves, but on the Enterprise he did considerable harm to his future ""lords."" As sophisticated as the androids seemed to be, they should not have been upset by the crew's charades and logic games but simply dismissed them.",5

The scheming Mudd returns to cause more intergalactic mayhem. I love the perfect comic timing during the interaction between Kirk and Mudd as Harry explains how he was arrested and escaped. I must be getting old as I'm now finding Stella rather attractive. Alas it is a flawed gem as I keep wondering how impostor Norman came to be on board the ship without being detected. Also, am I the only person who HATED the illogical behaviour scenes? I found them as embarrassing as the episode where Spock plays music with the rich kid hippies. BUT,,,,,,,,,,the part of this enjoyable episode which confuses me the most has not been mentioned by any other reviewer. Towards the very end as a gaggle of different looking female androids start to gather behind the stars of the show these are two or three absolutely REPULSIVE looking women among them. Why on earth is that. My best guess is that they held a competition with the prize being an appearance on ST. The producer must have shuddered when he saw the winners.",8

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. After a good run on its first season, the second season has more expectations to fulfill and hopefully they will try to develop the character a bit more and focus on the relations between the crew members on the enterprise to blend in and communicate easily with the audience despite of just focusing on more mind-numb missions that sometimes feel like they are filling their time and work in.The concept and the tricks projected in here aren't as convoluted and smart as the writers think which makes it more disappointing for their attempt however admirable, the resultant outcome is shallow and dull rather than interesting or entertaining.",

This go-around has Kirk and his Enterprise crew forced upon an ""android world"" thanks to old nemesis, Harry Mudd (Roger Carmel, rolling his R's, donning a Napoleon-like suit, spinning his mustache, and concocting yet another scheme). Mudd has managed to wind up on the android world while escaping another alliance he stole patents from (always a thief, that Harry). He has been served by the androids and is ready to abandon the planet for freedom elsewhere. How would he manage that? Oh, he brings the Enterprise crew to the planet and hitches a ride on the ship with androids manning the controls! Well, Kirk won't stand for that, but how will he stop the androids and Mudd's plan? Mudd always causes mischief and is up to no good. Mudd thinks the androids will have humans to serve and he'll be off the planet far away, not a care in the world. He doesn't count on the androids having a plan of their own: Mudd represents human flaw at its worst, with the androids realizing that they are needed to serve the human race, controlling them as well. Good ole Mudd just knows how to make matters even worse.Kirk outsmarting machines is a series regularity, and this time he gets all the regulars (Spock, Chekov, Uhura, Bones, and Scotty) to assist him in using illogic to bewilder and perplex them. Performance where they act outlandishly and use phraseology confusing to them is orchestrated. It is all amusing, eliciting chuckles. Nothing to take seriously here, as this is all about giggles with the conflict never much in terms of suspense. Carmel flashes his pirate grin and gleefully tells Kirk about how he will take the Enterprise and leave them behind. The introduction of an android version of his wife, and how she will be used against him at the end is a special hoot. The whole episode depends upon the androids' mission and the humans using chicanery to short circuit them so they can escape the world, halting the takeover of the Enterprise.

This forced the writing staff to come up with great story lines rather than rely on ships blowing each other up and other pointless action. Sure Star Trek also needs action, but great love stories also carried this series. Kirk, Spock, and Bones, are accompanied by a dying female diplomat, and are forced by an unknown being to remain on a lonely planet. They discover an astronaut who was believed to be dead many years earlier. The astronaut has developed an unusual relationship with the unknown being which keeps him from dying, but keeps him from leaving. There is no action or fighting in this episode, no great tension, it's just all about love. This is definitely a ""sleeper"" episode than is greatly under-appreciated.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Metamorphosis (TV Episode 1967)",Introducing Zephraim Cochrane - And the Franchise's Greatest Love Story,"This canonical episode of the original series explores the universality (and non-universality) of love, and introduces the inventor of warp drive, Zephraim Cochrane. Although obsessive fans may find fault in some aspects of Cochrane's barely explored back-story, this is the episode that created Cochrane's legend and laid the groundwork for one of the franchise's best efforts - First Contact - among others.Glen Corbett and Elinor Donahue are strong guest stars playing the bold personalities of, respectively, Cochrane and a terminally ill diplomat (Nancy Hedford) on a vital mission for the federation. En route, Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Hedford are essentially kidnapped by an energy being who they will come to know as The Companion. Once landed, they meet an impossibly young Zephraim Cochrane and hear the bizarre story of how he ended up about 200 years younger than he should be, alone with The Companion on a distant planet. Hedford will die if she doesn't get proper care very soon. Cochrane will die if he does not have some human companionship. The Companion may die without Cochrane. Our heroes are powerless to resolve these problems.The episode is very story-driven and well written by the stalwart Star Trek legend Gene L Coon. It is probably Ralph Senensky's best directorial effort on behalf of TOS. Shatner, Corbett and Donahue all give nice performances, even if Cochrane and Hedford are not the most likable characters in the pantheon. The special effects for this episode are decidedly mediocre, but do not detract from the flow of story.Recommended, even for non-fans.",9
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Metamorphosis (TV Episode 1967)",The Most Moving and Touching of Star Trek Episodes,"One criticism of Science Fiction, especially by non-sf people, is that not only is SF labeled as ""unrealistic"" (as if any movie or show can be ""realistic"") but it tends to be cold and emotionless. A Kleenex box might come in handy when viewing movies like ""Casablanca"" or ""Kramer vs Kramer"" but not typically for SF films. Science Fiction often deals with the wonders of futuristic technology or the fascination with the outer reaches of the universe. The invention of machines that transport molecules and the study of black holes and nebula are fascinating but not heart-wrenching. SF rarely explores the limitless realm of the inner heart. Certainly, there are times when space-suited characters might fall in love, but typically any love interest takes a back seat to the main thrust of the action.However, there are a few notable exceptions. ""Metamorphosis"", a Star Trek offering from the second season, deals directly with the emotional phenomenon of love and affection without lapsing into contrived sentiment. The story even propagates the universality of love while being at its essence pure science fiction. The usual trio, Kirk, Spock and McCoy are aboard the shuttle craft with precious cargo, a woman ambassador whose negotiating abilities are regarded as the only hope in stopping an interplanetary war. Simultaneously, the woman is afflicted with an uncommon illness that needs to be treated on the Enterprise. The three enterprise crew members are on a mission to bring the woman to the Enterprise and treat her so she can return to the negotiating process that will hopefully end the conflict. Their course is thwarted when a strange energy field appears to take control of the craft and send them onto a tiny planet.They find a human being, Cochran, who claims he was marooned there many years previous. And residing on the planet is the strange energy field that is determined not only to be a living entity but also having sentience. He calls the energy creature ""the companion"". At first we are led to believe ""the companion"" is keeping Cochran prisoner. But as the story unfolds, we learn that the companion is even more than sentient. It has true human-like emotions for Cochran.A wonderful episode that can stand up to the best love stories with a wonderful unexpected turn-of-events. And highest marks for the two guest stars, Elinor Donahue and the late Glenn Corbett. Only the superb acting of this episode makes it work. Not to be missed, and can be enjoyed by even non-sf viewers. And it probably is the only Star Trek episode that requires a box of Kleenex!",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Metamorphosis (TV Episode 1967)",The Long and Lonely Life of Zefram Cochrane,"I've gotten to appreciate this episode more as I became older, since it touches on the many aspects of older age: being alone, of becoming out of touch, archaic, and on the different perspectives, not all favorable, of immortality. The episode may have a slower pace than we're used to from this era of exciting original Trek shows, but it may also linger in the mind a bit longer due to the concepts presented, inviting introspection, of all things. Most of the episode concentrates on the main trio of regulars and the two guest stars (well, three, if you count the gaseous Companion); we don't even see a glimpse of the Enterprise or the rest of the crew until the 2nd half of the episode. We meet the creator of warp drive (very significant historically) and again see the Galileo shuttlecraft from ""The Galileo Seven"" episode. It begins as a seemingly simplistic tale of captivity on an unknown planet, but evolves gradually, due to some revelations, into an examination of love relationships between two species completely alien to each other.This examination is probably the most blatant attempt to visualize the IDIC principle, from the standpoint of relations between living beings. This is the Vulcan philosophy of 'Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations' - a concept probably treasured by Roddenberry and a cornerstone of his entire conception of future life. However, the marooned human man here, Cochrane, though about 100 years more evolved than the current humanity of the 21st century, is far behind 23rd century thinking as to what is socially acceptable in polite society. He shows himself to be very outdated and has to make an effort to adjust to new ways of thinking, of seeing things, in regard to human/extraterrestrial interaction. It's a leap that perhaps many in the audience need to make with him, as well. On the other hand, this high-minded IDIC philosophy, if not carefully written, may open the door to problematic areas during the course of the story.As in several episodes, non-corporeal aliens always tend to crave physical bodies such as we humans possess, as if our form is the ultimate conduit for finding true love. This seems a conceit due to writing from the human perspective and, though simple physical sensation may be a subject of curiosity (see ""Catspaw"" and ""By Any Other Name""), the deeper sensation of love should be attainable in a variety of ways. Why, for example, didn't the Companion transform Cochrane into a version of herself? In this case, the episode does provide a good answer: the concept of sacrifice, a strong indicator of actual love being expressed. I found the unpleasant character of the human female (very annoying, like all Federation diplomats) to be a bit overdone, showing the contrast between her and herself in the post-joining with the Companion. The fact that her essence disappears into the Companion is glossed over (it still seems to me only her body lives on, her mind is dead). And this war she was supposed to avert suddenly becomes a trivial matter at the conclusion. But, other than that, this is a thought-provoking story, like the best Trek. The character of Cochrane was reinterpreted in the movie ""Star Trek First Contact""(96) and, following along the cliché lines of present-day script-writing, was turned into a greedy drunkard, in contrast to the elegant performance by actor Corbett here.",7

Elizabeth Rogers' vocal performance of the Companion makes her truly a compelling character, as fully realized as any of the others.Elinor Donahue is transcendent at the conclusion, when her dying human form merges with the Companion, and "" the man"" decides to remain with her, rather than return to civilization with Kirk and the rest of the crew.This episode is a standout among the regular story lines, with a real emotional impact.

Nope, first we had Marla McGivers (Space Seed), Carolyn Palamas (Who Mourns For Adonias) and now Nancy Hedord, professional women all who are lonely and unfulfilled. Funny how James T. Kirk can be a man who is devoted to his profession who will never settle down but we can accept that. Not with women though.Well if that isn't bad enough, let's consider this episode's ultimate resolution. Nancy Hedford is dying of disease because this self-centered gas cloud ""Companion"" has forced the shuttle down to provide companionship for stranded Zefrem Cochran, and then later Hedford basically dies and the Companion takes over her body so the Companion can know what it means to love. For all this ""We are here"" junk, the fact remains that Nancy Hedford has been taken over by an alien for the alien's pleasure and only because she died thanks to being denied medical treatment that was needed. And oh BTW, isn't it interesting how James T. Kirk's revulsion for war in ""A Taste Of Armageddon"" goes out the window here? Because after all, the Commissioner, a professional the Federation thinks is the right woman for the job to stop a war taking place on another planet (how many people are dying in all that death, disease, destruction and horror that's taking place?) is gone now and Kirk just shrugs (in what reeks of an ""oops, we forgot about that point!"" moment put in the script the last minute), ""Oh, I guess the Federation will find SOME woman who can stop that war."" No big deal that people are dying somewhere else, so long as that Companion is happy. And just how is Kirk going to explain things to Scotty and company who he's been so chipper with on the communicator up to now? How is Kirk going to explain this to Starfleet? If he's not going to tell them about Cochran it's going to be his head for negligence! Please don't tell me I'm nitpicking and missing the ""big picture"". The fact is, if you want me to think about the ""deep"" issue of the story then don't screw up the details of the story that undermines your ""deep"" point. Make Hedford an ordinary bureaucrat in a dead-end desk-pushing job and you solve one problem at least. Failure to solve these problems is to put it bluntly, rotten writing.",
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Metamorphosis (TV Episode 1967)","""You might as well sit back and enjoy the ride"".","Well it's a big world, and apparently there are a lot of lonely folks out there - Harry Mudd ('I Mudd'), Trelane ('The Squire of Gothos'), and Apollo ('Who Mourns for Adonais?') just to name a few. Quite curiously, Captain Kirk and crew managed to find a lot of these lonely folks in an infinite universe, and most of the time they were looking to keep the Enterprise crew around for company.Fortunately, I was a fan of 'Father Knows Best' when I was a kid, and that made it a whole lot easier to accept Elinor Donohue in the role of the whiny Federation Ambassador Hedford. If the Princess hadn't been part of her resume I probably would have enjoyed the story a lot less. Now I know her character was suffering from the potentially fatal Sakuro's disease in the story, but I was a bit troubled by the idea that Kirk and Company didn't object at all to an alien presence taking over her body. I wasn't altogether convinced that Hedford was about to die, or did die as the Companion merged with her being. The resolution is one that's supposed to make us feel supportive of Cochrane (Glenn Corbett) finding someone to love and grow old with, but I found it just a bit unsettling beneath the surface.I think what I'll have to do is watch this one again after a while and see if my perception changes. I will say however that this is a well written and introspective story, examining a core principle at the heart of many a Star Trek episode - that Man will cease to grow and will eventually die (if not literally, then spiritually), if denied freedom and love. As usual, the show found a couple of exceptionally capable guest stars to portray their roles in a way to make a vivid and lasting impression.",7
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Metamorphosis (TV Episode 1967)",Great Classic Trek,"This episode shows the first introduction of the famous Zephrame Cochran. One of the founders in the Star Trek Mythos of ""To Boldly Go"", he was the one who made warp drive possible which lead to the founding of the Federation leading into the original series and what we were pleased to see in the other series that followed. So this person of great importance in this episode and it is similar to what it would be like in finding one of the signers of the Constitution living on a deserted island today.There are flaws to the episode but there couldn't have many because they keep bringing his character back either in reference throughout the different series or as a major character in one of the motion pictures. Sure he does not resemble the Zephrame Cochrane from First Contact but would we have even had this colorful character added into the Star Trek universe otherwise? The story is simple, Kirk, Spock, and Mccoy crash in a shuttle crash with a high ranking federation representative suffering a serious medical condition. A strange apparition appears and will not allow them to leave. They meet a human who appears familiar to them but hiding a secret. They eventually find the solution, a compromise allowing the apparition to combine with the ill, very female, federation representative. The apparition and recovered federation representative merge into one physical body and choose to remain on the planetoid with Cochran.One thing I admire about this episode as I do so many others from the original series is the visual aspect and soundtrack which takes a shoestring budget and turns it into a pure delight. It allows me to look past the fact that this doesn't even resemble the latter actor and his portrayal of Zephrame Cochran.They laid a foundation that can only be added to but never quite surpassed.",7
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Metamorphosis (TV Episode 1967)","An outstanding entry from ""Star Trek's"" second year!","It is obvious from the commentary from others in this forum that ""Metamorphosis"" is one of those Trek tales that one either loves or one hates. I fall into the former category, feeling that this is one of the best installments in the show's abbreviated ""five year mission"".Glenn Corbett, late of ""Route 66,"" replacing George Maharis in that show's final season, is very good as the Zephram Cochran, the man that would go on to develop the famous warp drive of ""Star Trek"" lore. Of course, the character returns in the eighth movie in a very different interpretation by Oscar nominee James Cromwell, but it is Corbett's quiet yet manly performance that is the focus of this episode. His revulsion at the idea that an alien blob of twinkling lights could have a romantic attraction toward him and his ultimate acceptance of said creature is quite believable.Elinor Donahue, late of both ""Father Knows Best"" and a brief stint on the classic ""Andy Griffith Show,"" is effective as both the dying commissioner and ""The Companion,"" appropriately alluring as the latter being that has loved Cochran during his stay on the planet.Of course, Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelly deliver their patented performances as Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, respectively, but they are upstaged by both Corbett and Donahue.",8
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Metamorphosis (TV Episode 1967)",Lovin' The Gaseous Alien.,"One of the visually best episodes, one that bird-brained Trekkies find dull. ""Nothing happens here, man!"" That's true; our Captain resists the urge to show off his Kirk-Fu skills by trying to chop-sokey the gaseous alien into the groin, Spock harasses no-one with his neck-pinch, and no red-shirts lose their lives to enemies with which Kirk anyway eventually makes peace.This episode is very well-acted however, with above-average dialogue, and an interesting setting and story. The only annoying thing I found here was that little floozy continually bitching, moaning, whining. If this were McCoy's ex-wife or some bored space housewife, then I'd understand, but a high-ranking Federation diplomat?? Aren't diplomats supposed to have a thick skin and plenty of patience? Not in Roddenberry's universe they don't. Thankfully, some diseases kill just in time, so once she's taken over by the lovin' gas, she calms down.There is also one logic flaw. How can a man spend 150 years with this gas - and a high-IQ man at that - and not realize that the bleedin' gas is in love with him? It's rather far-fetched that Kirk, a mere Captain, would almost straight away notice something which Methuselah failed to notice in all that time. And it's not as if he had cable TV and tennis to distract his thoughts away to anything else, either!",

Here we see Ms. Donahue in color, and she is dynamic. Even as she plays a less than thrilling person at first, by the time she is flashing that vibrant smile of hers, she holds the spotlight.I'm really not sure what all the negative responses about this episode are about. The events as to what happened to ZEPHRAIM (not Ephram as the other correcting review calls him) and Princess of Father Knows Best are intriguing and interestingly resolved. The decision of each will affect the other.Very nicely done by our two actors here as well.Ever wondered about how a show would have turned out had an actor not quit, had two characters married, had a different direction been taken? Rarely do we get an answer, but with this episode we do get the answer to ""What would Andy Griffith show have been like had Elly Walker stayed?"" She would have been as beautiful as she was here and things would have turned out differently all across Mayberry.",10
14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Metamorphosis (TV Episode 1967)",Fly Away On My Zefram,"In 'Metamorphosis"", a shuttlepod transporting Kirk, Spock, Bones, and a sick bureaucrat back to Enterprise gets inexplicably pulled onto a planetoid surface. The only inhabitant is the father of the warp drive Zefram Cochrane who lives with a non-corporeal being made up of electric energy. This being, known as the Companion to Zefram, has brought the crew here to keep the lonely Zefram company. The Companion cares for Zefram and will do anything to make him happy. She has reversed his aging process and allowed him to live here for hundreds of years. Kirk must figure out a way to convince the Companion to release them and get help for the sick bureaucrat who is on the verge of dying. When the Companion finally realizes that she can never feel true love for Zefram in her current form, she combines her energy with the bureaucrat, saving her life (did I mention the bureaucrat was female?) and allowing the two of them to combine in a happy symbiosis and be with Zefram. The crew leaves the two now-mortals happily ever after. I'm a sentimental sap and I found this episode absolutely charming to no end! I love the inclusion of Zefram who we've heard legends of all throughout Star Trek: Enterprise and TOS. I kind of like how he's a bit bigoted, not understanding the modern world or interspecies affection. His initial reaction is one of scorn and disgust. He is eventually won over by her new form, understanding all she's done for him. Everyone's performance in this episode is great. I love the setting, dialogue, plot, the works. The only thing that perturbed me was the cliché of the career-driven woman worrying about her lack of love on her death bed. Heaven forbid there be a strong female character who doesn't define her life by being a obedient housewife! I think the plot still works without using that as a device to soothe the audience when the two females merge. I could have done without this.Besides this, I think the episode is great and might be my favorite one up to this point chronologically. The plot's strong, it has interesting philosophical ideas, and leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside.",9
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Metamorphosis (TV Episode 1967)",Star Trek: The Original Series - Metamorphosis,"""Metamorphosis"" seems to be recognized as an elite episode within the erratic second season. I think it has quite the interesting developing story involving a lifeform (a type of gaseous cloud made up with a lot of electricity but feels and ultimately is sentient) in love with the celebrated inventor of warp drive, Zefram Cochrane (Glenn Corbett; I know him from Castle's ""Homicidal""). The lifeform intercedes in the travel of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy who are on board a shuttlecraft, the Galileo, taking a Federation diplomatic war-preventer, Nancy Hedford (Elinor Donahue) to the Enterprise to be treated for a disease she picked up accidentally elsewhere. Nancy is sore about contracting it, blaming the Federation for sending her out there without the proper precautions. The lifeform ""carries"" the Galileo to a type of nondescript planetoid, in no certain terms, imprisoning them with Cochrane who seems oblivious to the fact that *she* is willing to do whatever it takes to make him happy. He was 87 when he went into space to die, with the lifeform rescuing him, renewing his body, freeing him of age and returning him to his thirties. Kirk and company are growing concerned for Nancy's welfare as the disease is starting to ravage her body, a slow-starter than worsens as the fever sets in. Nancy opens the episode as ornery, short-tempered, with little tolerance for excuses. There's a conflict which could result in war and Nancy needs to get medical assistance in order to work his diplomatic magic. Later in the episode, Nancy overhears Zefram's disgust and dismay with the lifeform's love for him. She has never had that kind of affection and breaks down realizing that Zefram truly doesn't understand how swell that is. Spock develops a type of communicator which Kirk uses to try and talk the lifeform into letting them go so they could get Nancy to medical assistance. Ultimately, the joining that takes place, through the use of Nancy, affords the lifeform a chance to feel in a human form it couldn't in the gaseous, electric cloud. I am of the belief like some others that Nancy's body remains while little of the human still exists. What communicated from her doesn't seem to have the same personality at all, presenting a brand new creature for Zefram to spend a ""normal"" life with. I'm a bit uncomfortable with that, considering Nancy only dies because she wasn't allowed to leave the planetoid due to the lifeform. Kirk, Spock, and McCoy seem totally fine with it, so I guess another lifeform taking the body of a dying human who would have lived had she received assistance on the Enterprise is okay. Corbett relays an excited but secretive marooned genius, who understands that the lifeform should allow them to go but is loyal to the being that allowed him to live and frequently communicated with him through an affectionate ""joining"" for over 160 years. He reacts hostilely when informed of the lifeform's unrequited love for him, appalled at the idea that this ""thing"" and him could ever have a ""thing"". Cool use of the shuttlecraft; nice seeing the return of a Galileo. Trekkies could really dig this episode just for its introduction to a historical figure; Kirk and company allowed to meet Zefram adds particular significance to the story. A lot of care is given to the plot and it is especially well directed. Despite my own wariness on the ""body snatching"", I have somewhat accepted that maybe Nancy, before her death, was okay with it because she would be allowed to live, know what true love is, and experience something extraordinary in the process.",8
16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Metamorphosis (TV Episode 1967)","Melodramatic, misogynistic crap","You have to expect some level of melodrama and misogyny when watching Star Trek, but this episode really overdose it. From it's portrayal of career-minded Ambassador Hedford who cries on her death bed that she had never been loved (because of course women can't have both a career and a fulfilling love life) to the downright stupid gendering of the Companion as female (because male and female are ""universal concepts"" that, of course, always present themselves in the same way). By the time the Companion took over Ambassador Hedford's body (saying that the two became one but the Hedford half did not survive ?), which is met not with horror from Kirk and Co. but grimacing amusement, I was ready to turn the TV off if curiosity of how much worse it could get did not keep me watching.Definitely, an episode to skip for all but the most misogynist, emotionally immature trekkies.",1
17,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Metamorphosis (TV Episode 1967)",Misinterpretation of affections.,"This episode, for some reason, weighs on my mind. For whatever reason, I'm reminded of some cliché love stories depicting the masculine leader of some private firm with a dedicated secretary who secretly has a crush on him, or the captain of the football team or cheerleader who similarly has a secret admirer. There's a difference in social class, whatever it may be, and hence a misinterpretation by the object of affection when presented with friendly interaction by the second party.That story is presented here, but given the ending that I think most lonely hearts who've been the third wheel in a love triangle have and will always desire. It's the favorable scenario that hearts of both colors, good and ill, hope to achieve for polar opposite reasons. The good heart wants love and affection for the sake of it, and to be happy and content. The bad heart usually has some ulterior motive, usually material gain.The same suspicion is briefly presented, but we the audience are shown the misinterpretation on both counts. Kirk, Spock and McCoy try to apply Star Fleet know how to put themselves back on track, but, to paraphrase Edward Devere; ""Hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn..."" Their efforts are for naught.The truth of why they're there is revealed early on in the story, but the real truth becomes manifest later on, and it's not one that we as the audience, nor Captain Kirk, disagree with.There are two action sequences, and some usual sci-fi mystery a-la Classic Trek, but once these are set aside (or ever so briefly injected into the plot) the real story is made manifest. We're given the gamut of emotions. From gratitude, to shock, to disgust, acceptance, and all shades of gray in between.The physical barrier that separate the two primary focuses are analogous for a variety of social rifts. The rich girl who falls for the bad boy who grew up on the other side of the tracks, or the country girl falling for the city kid, and any other iteration of a Romeo and Juliet theme you'd like to transplant.There's an even deeper story being told here as well. The purported inventor of Warp Drive wants off this world, and vicariously through Kirk and crew, intellect is applied to a dilemma of two hearts. This is where the second action sequence comes in. Through this the one true solution is found. The one solution that works and actually resolves one major problem for the Enterprise's commanding officer, and his department heads.In this way it's actually a very reassuring story. For with all the strife between the various antagonists of the Star Trek universe, Klingons, Romulans, sundry super-powerful beings and violent primitive cultures in need of quarantine, not to mention the occasional starship captain gone bad or high-tech device gone haywire, there is a spot on some far off secluded and inviting world for two people to spend time with one another, and be happy.I don't know that it would make a good date episode, particularly for younger generations, but, if you're a classic Star Trek fan, and have a person of whom you are fond, then this might be an interesting diversion for an hour or so.Enjoy.",
18,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Metamorphosis (TV Episode 1967)",Creepy!,"This episode started fine. Kirk and crew are stranded on an asteroid where they come across the marooned inventor of the warp drive, Cochrane, who has developed an attachment to a cloud creature. Kirk slowly discovers that Cochrane and the cloud creature love each other romantically and its best to let them be. This episode is a somewhat mature investigation of the meaning of love and immortality. I love the message that love can transcend human passions and all sorts of boundaries. And then the end ruins the whole message: the cloud creature possesses the body of an attractive female human so that Cochrane has a female human body to love. Speaking religiously, a person being possessed is an act of the devil. Speaking scientifically, it's known as multiple personality disorder. In either case, it's creepy - not romantic. And yet, Kirk and Cochrane look on with smiles as the woman becomes possessed by the cloud, which makes the whole situation even more creepy.",
19,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Metamorphosis (TV Episode 1967)",Some interesting and some archaic philosophies,"There are some good insights in this episode, like the Captain's speech about existence (how we are defined by existing among other people, experiencing things, getting old, etc). Things that make you think.My problem is this: The idea of male and female as ""universal concepts"" is completely absurd! It's a human social concept which can't be applied to other animals so how could it apply to the rest of the entire universe? You don't assign genders to hermaphroditic species, do you? Incredibly illogical, old fashioned concept, considering they are just ideas we impose (men are more like ""this"" and females more like ""that"" except nothing truly defines them, because you can be and identify as female when you are more like ""this"" and vise versa). It erases same-sex romance and closeness (because if it's a ""female"" spirit it is automatically in ""love"" with the character) Is that the only relationship men and woman can have with each other? Could it not be brother and sister? Mother and son? Old friends? No, it has to be ~lovers~ They like to anthropomorphize everything in this show, but this time they take it farther and it ends sort of ambiguously. What happened to ambassador Hedford? What about her desires, her ""existence""? I am disillusioned at the ending.",7
20,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Metamorphosis (TV Episode 1967)",Slightly below average,"This isn't a particularly great episode--and much of the blame for it rests on the annoying character Eleanor Donahue is asked to play at the beginning of the show. This ambassador is pretty whiny and doesn't do a lot to improve the perception of women! Plus, this view of Zefram Cochran is pretty dull. Square-jawed Glenn Corbet is awfully gosh-darn nice, but he's also not nearly as compelling as James Cameron's screwed up version of Cochran from STAR TREK FIRST CONTACT. The characters are 180 degrees different. There's also a weird love story that I didn't find super-compelling.As for the rest of the show, it was okay. The writing was okay and the rest of the actors did their usual professional jobs. Not a bad show, but one that isn't quite up to snuff either.",6

My favorite line is by the Companion, toward the end: ""So this is loneliness. Oh, what a bitter thing. How could you stand it?"" But fortunately Zefram Cochran learns to open his mind and accept the Companion for who she is, as well as to appreciate the depth of her sacrifice for him.As a young kid, I found this episode somewhat maudlin, but I appreciate it much more now. Like ""This Side of Paradise"" (first season episode with Jill Ireland), a more apt term to describe this episode is ""bittersweet"". Both the Companion and Cochran gain, and lose, at the end: they gain the possibility for deeper companionship; but now both will age and die. Cochran, who has already lived a full life (before being healed and de-aged by the Companion), is willing to accept a quiet life instead of exploring the galaxy, to honor the Companion's sacrifice.",8

So when he shows up alive and well on an undiscovered planet quite beyond the age that humans survive and young to boot there's got to be a reason for that. Just what has Glenn Corbett who plays Cochrane tapped into?What brings the Enterprise to this planet is a false distress signal sent out not by Cochrane although his presence and vitality begat a lot of questions. What sent the message is an incorporeal being, which appears as a cloud who envelops Corbett. For lack of a better term the being is just called the Companion and it can apparently satisfy all of Corbett's needs and a few of its own.What Corbett needs however is to break out of his velvet prison and not incidentally the availability of fellow human beings just to talk to. That's why the Enterprise away team is there consisting of William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and DeForest Kelley. And a patient of Kelley's a Star Fleet diplomat played by Elinor Donahue who is dying of an incurable malady unless the Enterprise reaches earth.This is one of my favorite Star Trek episodes with a solution worked out for the benefit of all, including the Companion.

We also see other Vulcans, but not just any Vulcans: Spock's father, Sarek, makes his first appearance, as well as Spock's human mom (both superbly played by Lenard and Wyatt). Before you can say 'Tal-shaya,' Kirk almost gets whacked, Spock gets slapped and McCoy goes on a little power trip in his sickbay. This might denote another comedy from Trek, such as ""The Trouble With Tribbles,"" but though there are some humorous moments, it's mostly an episode driven by intrigue, suspense and interesting drama on the Vulcan side, where even more backstory is revealed on Spock, as sort of a follow-up to ""Amok Time."" I think it's this episode, more than any other, in which Spock's lonely place in the Trek universe is spelled out. We, as the audience, had already gathered as much during the past forty or so episodes, but here, Spock's mother, the ideal choice to voice such concerns out loud, makes apparent the pain Spock has endured during his life - in terms we had only guessed at earlier. She had known since he was a little boy that he belongs in neither the human nor the Vulcan worlds and, as a mother, she had no choice but to feel his pain, that ultimate form of alienation - but, as a human, her feelings are much more obvious to us. Nimoy gives another subtly excellent performance; his demeanor is slightly different when speaking with his mother about 'the situation' between himself and his father. Despite the Vulcan reserve, you sense his discomfort and sadness.The great thing about a Trek episode such as this is it propels us full throttle into this universe of the Federation, its allies, its enemies (Orion pirates - who would've thought?), its politics and even its social customs. We learn about a Vulcan method of the quick kill, as another sample, and it's 'interesting' to hear Spock speak of his father's killing capability in that unemotional tone. It's almost like a handbook on the 23rd century done up in episodic video style. The drama is balanced out by some nice action scenes and thrills. Kirk does pull an odd move in his fight with the assassin, but there was no stuntman involved, to Shatner's credit (uh, maybe that's why they did use stuntmen usually). Mention should also be made of actor Nalder as the lead Andorian; as in a couple of other episodes, an actor's accent and appearance made him the ideal choice to play the alien.",9

Fontana episode introduces Sarek and Amanda - Spock's mother and father - to the Star Trek canon. Mark Lenard and Jane Wyatt are two of the best guest stars in TOS, and they not only nail their characters, but help Journey to Babel to flesh out Vulcan psyche - in particular Spock's - more than any previous episode. Veteran character actor William O'Connell also does a nice job as Thelev.All three of the series' main characters are nicely scripted and well played in this episode, and the only moment at which the directing slips slightly over-dramatized moment just after a fairly wild fight scene between Kirk and Thelev. The cinematography, special effects and editing are all about as good as TOS gets.The Enterprise is delivering a number of diplomats from various cultures to the neutral planet Babel for a negotiation summit. After an argument with Sarek, one of the delegates turns up murdered by what appears to be a Vulcan martial arts technique. Soon after, Sarek falls ill with a cardio-vascular problem. And Spock, his disassociated son is his only hope for a blood donor. This takes us about 1/3rd of the way through the story.....

2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Journey to Babel (TV Episode 1967)",Vulcan familial relationships and butt-fu,"We get an interesting double plot in this episode. We get a good action story as the Enterprise is shuttling a number of ambassadors to a Federation meeting which will determine whether the planet Coridan will be admitted into the Federation, and more importantly for the overall Star Trek mythos, we finally get to meet Spock's parents, Sarek and Amanda.The presence of Spock's parents allows writers D.C. Fontana and Gene Roddenberry to further their character development of Spock as a man half-Vulcan and half-human. There are a number of wryly humorous moments between Spock and his father, who we learn not only have the normal Vulcan unemotional relationship, but who have some bad feelings towards each other. Maybe because they're feelings, they don't talk about it, and just ignore the situation as best as they can. Amanda, played by an elegantly attractive Jane Wyatt, proves to be a surprising fulcrum balancing the two. Surprising because despite being married to Sarek for so many years, her spunky emotionalism still shines through, and her being married to Sarek seems contradictory to the ""pure Vulcan"" way of looking at things. This suggests that the cracks that we occasionally see in Spock's unemotional public veneer aren't just there because he's half human--it seems to be almost as much a Vulcan trait.The action side of the episode is a lot of fun, and the menagerie of less human aliens on their way to the Federation meeting would have been a blast to explore more. Perhaps if there's a flaw to this episode, it's that it should have been two separate episodes, instead. But then of course we'd miss out on one way of showing the non-emotional Vulcan sense of duty and its ethical priorities.There's a great William Shatner fight with an alien in this one. I always get a kick out of his fight scenes, and this one is particularly notable because of the weird ""butt-fu"" move that he performs just before he gets injured. It's a hoot.DeForest Kelley also gets some choice lines here, especially right before the credits roll.",10

We learn that he had a teddy bear (of sorts) as a child and we also learn of Spock's anguish growing up as a ""half-breed"". On top of all this great family interaction, it was great to finally see multiple species other than humans in an episode, as the ship was ferrying ambassadors to a peace conference.Pluses for the episode apart from the insights into Spock were much, much better than usual dialog, an exciting and multi-layered plot and plenty of action despite the episode taking place entirely on the Enterprise. All in all, one of the better episodes and one nearly meriting a score of 9.",8

She sets pretty much everyone straight at some point or other. Now let's see, you get to see Spock attempt to teach McCoy the ""live long and prosper"" hand thingy, you get to see Kirk battle an alien hand to hand, you get to meet lots of alien races, you get a big space battle, and you get to know Spock's family...not bad! I guess the only thing missing is Kirk doesn't get a chance to score with any alien babes...oh well. Oh yeah, Chekov gets to take Spock's place at the science station on the brig...that was cool.It was worth the price of admission just to watch Spock and Sarek try like crazy to out Vulcan each other...ha. Spock won out cause he was willing to let his dad die in order to command the enterprise while Kirk was out of action. My only complaint about the entire episode was the rather weak way Kirk won the space battle...those must have been some incredibly stupid aliens.Yeah, this is an awesome episode, the show was really hitting its stride at this point, this being episode 44.

Just wanted to add that Reggie Nalder should have won an Emmy for his portrayal of the Andorian ambassador Shras. The scene after Kirk was attacked, when Shras spoke to Spock is remarkable. The first time I saw this episode, it gave me goosebumps. Even to this day, I have rarely scene an actor portray an alien so good. Words can't describe it. I know part of it was due to the fire that marred his appearance. But his accent and cadence was so outworldly. Every wannabee alien actor should watch this.",9

Corridan is an underpopulated world whose mineral wealth make it a target for those who wish to steal its wealth; and these people would prefer it doesn't get the protection Federation membership would provide. It turns out the Vulcan ambassador is none other than Spock's father. Tensions rise when the Tellarite ambassador is found murdered shortly after he has been seen arguing with the Vulcan ambassador, Sarek; he explains that he didn't do it as that would have been illogical. There is little time to judge him though as he collapses with a heart condition; if McCoy is to save him he will have to find somebody with matching blood for a transfusion there is only person who matches; Spock. Tensions rise even further when a strange ship starts shadowing the Enterprise and Kirk is attacked by one of the Andorian delegation. These means Spock must decide whether it is more logical to help his dying father or take command of the Enterprise at this dangerous time.This is a superior episode which nicely combines drama with fascinating background information about Spock including the first sighting of his parents. We see how Spock's father doesn't approve of his son's career choice leading to bad feeling that will last until Sarek's final appearance in an episode of 'Star Trek: The Next Generation'. This episode also serve to introduce the Tellarites and Andorian; the latter of which will go on to be a major species in the prequel series 'Star Trek: Enterprise'.

Sarek shows obvious disappointment with his son because of his choice to join Starfleet. This is a major diplomatic gathering. There are hopes that a particular planet, rich in resources, can join the economic union but there is a lot of disdain among planets that would need to resolved to get a positive result. Three major events take place. Kirk is stabbed by an Andoriean, Serak has a heart attack and needs his son to allow a transfusion, and another diplomat is also killed. There are also warlike forces out there, trying to prevent any kind of alliance. The byplay between Spock and his father as the maintain their stoic being, is quite entertaining.

It also introduces his human mother Amanda - both Mark Lenard and her will make reappearances in the Star Trek movies (Mark Lenard starting in The Search For Spock, and Amanda in The Voyage Home). This episode also introduces the enmity between Sarek and Spock, the resolution of this conflict which will be resolved in full in The Voyage Home and more so in The Next Generation episodes ""Unification Parts I and II"" which involves both Sarek and Spock again.

9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Journey to Babel (TV Episode 1967)","""Threats are illogical.""","In case anyone missed the coincidence, this was the second Star Trek episode in a row to feature a guest spot from the decade earlier hit series 'Father Knows Best'. Elinor Donohue appeared in #2.9 'Metamorphosis', while her TV mom Jane Wyatt showed up here as what else, a TV mom, that of everyone's favorite Vulcan - Spock. The story line does a creditable job of expanding on Spock's personal history as half human, half Vulcan, and with the presence of Mark Lenard portraying Spock's father Sarek, the themes of logic and rationality are given an intensive workout.The personal story is played out as part of a larger plot element involving diplomatic negotiations among ambassadors on board the Enterprise headed toward the planetoid Babel. Competing interests among the representatives threaten (and eventually lead to) hostilities, as the impending conference will decide whether planets of the Coridan System will become part of the Federation. If that wasn't enough going on, a third party is presented as a foil in order to profit from the dissension.But the better part of the story is taken up by exploring the relationship between Spock and his father. When Sarek experiences a Vulcan heart attack, only his son's blood type will prove effective in supplying the transfusion needed to save his life. This allows for a further exploration of Spock's familial ties while balanced against his duties as a Starfleet officer. To say the writers handled the situation quite logically would be an understatement. The episode features some of the series' finest scripting and dialog, while placing Amanda Sarek (Wyatt) squarely in the center of the Human/Vulcan drama playing out between her husband and son.Not to be outdone, Captain Kirk and Dr. McCoy have their moments here as well. Kirk's involved in a near fatal tussle with an Orion disguised as an Andorian, and I don't care how many times you rewind to watch it again, but that move during their fight is simply impossible to explain. I'd try to describe it but you'll just have to see it yourself. As for Bones, he successfully makes the save for Sarek, while triumphantly declaring he got in the last word.One thing unresolved though - did Coridan join the Federation?",8
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Journey to Babel (TV Episode 1967)",Provides helpful background for Spock,"This was a pretty good episode, I thought. Spock's mysterious Vulcan and human parents are finally revealed, and some details of Spock's difficult childhood are revealed (although I suspect many fans immediately noticed that the actor playing Sarek, Mark Lenard, had recently played a Romulan in the episode ""Balance of Terror""; even as a kid, I noticed this). Spock and his father Sarek are estranged here, and remain somewhat estranged for the rest of their lives, as revealed in Star Trek TNG (""Reunion"" two part episode). Spock's overwhelming sense of duty to Starfleet doesn't seem all that misplaced here, in that the ship does very nearly come to destruction from alien attack, and Spock had figured out a key element of the alien technology that might have been helpful.Fortunately, Kirk manages to pull things through on his own (as he always does), albeit with a rather corny 'playing dead' maneuver that would never work in reality (why didn't the alien ship just blast the Enterprise from a safe distance?) My only major complaint is the portrayal of Spock's mother, Amanda. She comes across as the stereotypical flighty emotional human female. Indeed, it is difficult to see why Sarek married her-- unless he simply had the hots for her (during a convenient Pon Farr event, perhaps, when he happened to meet her?) Amanda is blatantly inconsistent here-- she says she 'can't risk both Spock and Sarek', yet later insists that Spock undergo the dangerous experimental procedure in order to save Sarek's life and even slaps Spock when he initially declines.",7

Captain Kirk is attacked by a spy passing off as an Andorian. To make matters more complicated, it is Spock's father Sarek who is the prime suspect of the murder. He is ailing and requires surgery, a dangerous transplant with Spock.Just describing this episode I realized what a dense episode this is! There's a lot of plot to it and a lot of new alien species and characters. The introduction of Spock's parents was interesting and I really enjoy the dynamic that Spock has with his mother especially. While the he politics of the Federation is ostensibly the focal point of this episode, it really focuses more on Spock's relationship with his parents.The big reveal is that the Orions are behind all the shenanigans. They want to plant a seed of mistrust through the Federation and are worried about losing a valuable trading partner in the Coridans.

There's a conference on board the Enterprise with various alien races meeting under StarFleet auspices to decide the disposition of Corridan. The Vulcan delegate is Mark Lenard, a galaxy renowned diplomat named Sarek. He brings his wife who is played by Jane Wyatt. Oh, and they're Leonard Nimoy's parents.A whole lot of the Vulcan world is revealed with Spock's interaction with his parents. The usual emotions among parents and child are severely subdued. Difficult indeed for Spock as his human side is testing the Vulcan philosophy he's been raised on.Some physical problems result to as Lenard takes ill and has the Vulcan equivalent of a heart attack. There's also a murder of one of the delegates, one who was seen quarreling with Sarek. That's William Shatner's problem to deal with.Toward the end its DeForest Kelley who steps to the front. Dr. McCoy has not had much experience with Vulcan surgery. His challenges are considerable.Quite a lot is packed into this extremely well written story. The character of Sarek would carry over into The Next Generation and in that the cycle of life for Sarek is complete.

Sarek is a key voice during the process as his opinion holds much weight. An Andurian (blue skin, antennae, and prone to use violence) attempts to kill Capt Kirk, but what motivates this assault? Meanwhile, Sarek has a heart problem in need of a surgical procedure requiring a serious blood transfusion. Spock is the only viable candidate, but this procedure could kill him. A ship begins to attack the Enterprise, Kirk is temporarily incapacitated after the fight with the faux Andurian, and Spock assumes command, not convinced by Bones to participate in the surgery due to his duties as a Starfleet officer (rules and regulations take precedent to the life of his father, that damned Vulcan logic). Anyway, Kirk must figure out a way to get Spock onto the operating table while suffering a prolonged injury (he was stabbed in the back; nearly his heart was pierced). But, despite all of this turmoil, Kirk still maintains his poise and commanding proficiency by outsmarting the ship seemingly on a suicide mission to destroy the Enterprise, constantly evading phaser fire due to its engine's capability of Warp 10, ramming the ship in intervals. This is a fan favorite for obvious reasons, but I think the inclusion of Sarek's wife/Spock's mama, Amanda (Jane Wyatt) adds something special because as Vulcans are so dependent upon the absence of emotion and inclusion of logic in everything, she is that human side that muddies the waters. Spock even asks Sarek why he married Amanda and he felt it was ""logical thing to do at the time."" After watching ""Sarek"", an exceptional third season episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, I thought it was only logical (pun intended) to watch the Classic Star Trek episode, Journey to Babel. I'm glad I did; they are an appropriate double feature if there ever was one. I love the scene where Amanda appeals to her son's ""human side"" to put aside his Starfleet loyalties and Vulcan logic to save his father, such pleading falling on deaf pointed ears. There has always been the struggle for Spock, the human and Vulcan sides providing much conflict in his life, but this has made for some great television, some great drama. It was a nice moment for Bones as he tells Kirk and Spock to shut up and gets the last word! What a terrific episode. Mark Lenard holds a quiet dignity and commands respect even if he coldly interacts with his son who chose Starfleet over the Vulcan Science Academy, Spock defying the wishes of his father.",10

In most situations this would be too much, but the episode is so well paced, never staying on one part for too long.

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. After a good run on its first season, the second season has more expectations to fulfill and hopefully they will try to develop the character a bit more and focus on the relations between the crew members on the enterprise to blend in and communicate easily with the audience despite of just focusing on more mind-numb missions that sometimes feel like they are filling their time and work in.It meddles with Spock and its emotions which is always intriguing to encounter since its characters is always kept behind the curtain and has the potential to explore it in and addition to that Journey To Babel is more man-to-man than any other.",

Here's the problem: 
1) The acting sucked. Mark Lenard was much better as a Romulan, and in a superior episode, and episode closer to a 10 then this garbage. Spots mom - she did fine, if you're into daytime soap opera crap. I liked the close up with the wet eyes - NOT! The regular cast did fine, but definitely not the best. Jerkoff was there but did nothing. You Whore You was there and also added very little. Spot's performance in Amok Time is amazing. Here it's good. Not great. I did enjoy Spots mom slapping Spot. All the nonsense in sick bay at the end was another happy joke ending. A Joke. The alien acting was decent. Definitely one of the worst acting episodes, below the Val episode. 
2) The cut scene where we see Captain Jerk in a fight with the imposter alien, did we miss something. Maybe they should have shown a few seconds before when the alien attacked, not in the middle of the fight. The fight itself was good. Also, they showed too much of the Spot family dynamics and not enough of the enemy plot.
This was an ok episode. Rating is a C or D, 5 stars at most. Mostly for introducing Spots parents and some aliens. These are important for Star Trek background. The actors did their parts. The plot is weak. Given all the praise, I must compensate with a 1. If you're going to recommend a Star Trek episode to a new viewer it would not be this, or City on the Edge of Nonsense.

On the one hand you have an almost Agatha Christie style whodunit, and on the other Spock's family melodrama. But the episode is so well made, the performances so good, that it just sorta works despite itself.Seeing Spock's background fleshed out is always fun, and there seemed to be a concerted effort to do so in S2.

In this case, it's the unborn child of a ruler who has just been killed in a coup; hence, the child's life is forfeit, before it even begins. This is the alien culture to which Kirk, Spock and McCoy beam down as guests and end up as fugitives. Overall, this is a good example of Roddenberry's vision, that of meeting and dealing with other planetary cultures. Writer Fontana managed to create a warrior-race here with truly alien morals, customs and sensibilities (in our eyes), a culture which seems very cruel and so high on testosterone that even Kirk looks somewhat fragile in many scenes. There's even a cool new weapon invented for this episode, the kligat (oops, sounds like Klingon). Of course, except for their average height of 6 and a half feet, the natives here are probably just a throwback to ancient Earth cultures, such as the Vikings or those barbaric hordes which threatened Rome on occasion. Although, this culture of '10 Great Tribes' also reminds one of Earth's past royalty, where-in royal heirs were sometimes assassinated at early age - notably in Rome itself. This may make them obvious allies of the Klingons, one of whom shows up here to bedevil Kirk (following ""Errand of Mercy""). But, as is usual for Trek episodes, the story doesn't follow the obvious path.It turns out, these Capellans are much more honorable than the average Klingon of the original series and this all gets spelled out by the conclusion. Interestingly, McCoy is the resident expert on these people, due to spending time on the planet in the past. His retort to the Klingon during a key meeting scene is a near-classic Trek moment. The story is hampered by a limited, plodding plot line and a female queen/spoiled brat (Newmar) who is definitely an acquired taste - some viewers may find her amusing, a la the later ""Elaan of Troyius"" - and most will be annoyed. Most of the 2nd half consists of our heroes scrambling among rocks and hills to stay out of reach of the trailing alien posse. The story is also filled with silly moments and contrivances. Kirk fights one of the lethal male Capellans during the takeover coup as both McCoy & Spock stand a couple of feet away looking quite bored. The Klingon (actor Andrews of ""Mod Squad"" fame) has the new ruler in his pocket and then throws it all away near the end for no real reason except a bad temper and no patience. And why did the Klingons send only one agent, anyway? Seems like they were too sneaky for their own good. Then there's the whole 'kootchy-koo' scene I always try to forget. I did like Scotty's latest turn commanding the Enterprise; his 'fool me once, fool me twice' line is a good moment for the actor, Doohan.",7
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Friday's Child (TV Episode 1967)",Another Anthropological Fiasco,"Interesting primarily for its guest appearances, Friday's Child is one of Joe Pevney and D. C. Fontana's more mediocre efforts. Among the guests is great musical and stage actress Julie Newmar, who is mainly known to TV audiences for having played Catwoman in the classic Batman TV show. Casting called for a number of very tall and beefy people, so many of the guest stars are over 6' and recognizable by sight if not by name.The trinity (Kirk, Spock, McCoy + a soon-to-die redshirt) have beamed down to a planet inhabited by a very hierarchal, male-dominated culture whose rank system revolves around violence. Upon arrival, they find that a Klingon (only one?) has arrived before them. The Klingon has been propagandizing against the federation since his arrival, and has jeopardized the Enterprise's mission to obtain mineral rights. The redshirt makes matters worse by threatening the Klingon at first sight.Although McCoy once lived on this planet and briefs the crew on some ethnographic details ahead of time, these preparations were not nearly enough, as the away team creates one blunder after another. Fontana did a nice job of thinking out the alien culture's intricacies, but unfortunately, the episode devolves into a somewhat unoriginal action adventure about mid-way through.Cinematography and effects are very average for TOS, writing is OK, directing is well below Pevney's usual mark, and acting is fairly good. Look for a lot of amusing but hokey banter with Spock in this one, and a solid and interesting performance by Ms. Newmar.",6
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Friday's Child (TV Episode 1967)","A few imperfections do not stop this being a solid, entertaining episode","Kirk, Spock, and McCoy arrive at a primitive planet to negotiate a mining treaty with a volatile and tribal warrior society. But they get unwillingly entangled with a treacherous Klingon agent and dangerous local politics, and before long they have to flee natives out to kill them. To make matters worse, they have in tow a dead chief's hostile, pregnant wife who does not want her child, while the Enterprise is in no position to rescue them because it is tangling with a Klingon warship.This episode manages to be engaging and entertaining despite some problems here and there. It's a good example of a Star Trek episode that is not the highest quality, but worthy nevertheless.It effectively presents the theme of the Federation having to deal with cultures that have different values and outlook. The tribal culture is honorable yet brutal, polite yet lethal if someone makes a misstep. Also, all the regular cast members get to do solid character work, especially DeForest Kelly as our cranky yet compassionate Dr. McCoy: he cares for his patients but is not above slapping one if she gets out of line. And James Doohan's Scotty does some of his best episode work here in the very well-done subplot about the Enterprise's troubles with the Klingon ship. The presentation of the local politics is an effective bit of mini-drama that helps establish what's at stake for our heroes.But imperfections creep into the script: the Julie Newmar character was adequately developed as someone who grows sympathetic toward her new allies and her own newborn baby, but the script wasted her precious screen time on the annoying, unfunny ""our child"" and ""child is yours"" humor sequences. That time could have been spent exploring the Newmar character's reasons for not wanting her child, and could have made the transformation in her attitude more gradual and effective.Also, the climax involved the Klingon blowing his top and defying everybody without much motivation.But while those problems decrease the episode's quality, ""Friday's Child"" still stands up as an enjoyable, agreeable journeyman entry and a chance to see our regular characters at their best.",7
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Friday's Child (TV Episode 1967)","""Only the strong should live"".","I think I would have been disappointed if Julie Newmar hadn't shown up in a Star Trek guest spot at least once during the series run. I believe I first became aware of her in that short lived mid-Sixties show 'My Living Doll', followed up by appearances as Catwoman in the campy 'Batman' TV show. Her role is a bit perplexing here as Eleen, the feisty, pregnant and as it turns out, widow of the Capellan leader Akaar (Ben Gage). How she managed to turn McCoy into a potential replacement hubby is a bit beyond my ability to follow the story line, so I'll just leave it alone.The Enterprise trio of Kirk, Spock and McCoy once more find themselves in a tough spot amid a warrior race much like the Klingons. In fact there's a Klingon here as well who beats the Federation to the planet in order to secure the mining rights to topaline, a vital component of colonial life support systems. I just couldn't get over the idea that the Capellans, for all their size and strength, found it acceptable to decorate their outfits with feathered boas. How does that jive with 'only the strong should live'. It's like inviting trouble right from the get-go.Chalk up another strong outing for Scotty. Faced with the decision to rescue the boys from Capella or answer a distress call from an unarmed freighter, Scotty stays consistent with Federation duty and leaves orbit to help the ship under attack. Turns out it was a Klingon ruse, but no harm done. That Scotty earned his pay once again.About half way through Star Trek's entire three season run, I'll go on record now stating that this episode might have the goofiest line of the entire series. It's when Bones states- ""I'm a doctor, not an escalator"". What???? Who came up with that line?",7
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Friday's Child (TV Episode 1967)",Not a great episode,"This episode featured yet another situation where the Enterprise crew is forced to negotiate with an unfamiliar and somewhat primitive culture in order to obtain a much-needed resource (in this case, a valuable mineral). Here, the major complication is that a wily Klingon has preceded the Enterprise crew and is favored by at least one faction. In their second major appearance (after ""Errand of Mercy""), the Klingons are portrayed fairly unfavorably here-- both treacherous and cowardly. The Klingons of the first appearance were brutal, all right, but seemed to have at least a rudimentary sense of honor, which is completely lacking here.Julie Newmar plays the young wife who takes an odd shine to McCoy after he slaps her. Sheesh, I guess the way to a woman's heart is to be a roughneck? I know this is supposed to be a culture that values physical toughness, but one would think that women would be exempt from casual brutality, even one as annoying as her. She has a fairly thankless role here as the bratty and aloof first wife and is mostly wasted, especially for those of us who thought she was a great ""Catwoman"".Probably the most interesting part of the episode was Scotty's cat and mouse game with a Klingon ship that uses a diversionary tactic that works once, but not twice on the clever engineer. Scotty was the real hero of this episode, staring down the Klingon ship and coming to Kirk's rescue. Chekhov had the funniest line here. Unfortunately, the bulk of the episode is rather dull, consisting mainly of the landing party's rather fumbling attempts to negotiate with a hostile and mostly unfamiliar culture.",5

Hello, you metrosexuals - this is how real men used to be. Some of us still are that way. Take notes. Women LIKE guys who are men, not sensitive pieces of jelly. We are seen as blank canvases upon which to practice their craft (male improvement), not flawed, completed imitations of the real thing. Get used to it.At any rate, the show itself is better than the insipid reviews would have one believe. By the second season, the writers and Gene Roddenberry had stopped taking themselves so seriously and began to inject some humor into the episodes - just because they could. Viewers at the time enjoyed that. Not every TV show has to be ""relevant."" Sometimes, a show is just a show - pure fantasy and escapism. It's about time people started realizing that again.Spock's reaction to the name of the new Te'er child was priceless. It's rare indeed that McCoy and Kirk get to one-up the Science Officer, let alone to see him show exasperation. Julie Newmar was perhaps the most unconvincing expectant mom I ever saw. She walked normally, rather than waddling the way many slender women do with large, full-term babies. That's no insult, either, it's just fact. Guys, if you don't believe it - you have a soccer ball implanted into YOUR abdomen, resting on your bladder and kidneys, and try walking normally. Ain't gonna happen. Ask your wives, if you are dads. (BTDT, four times myself as the dad.) I have a healthy respect for a gal who endures it ONCE.Eight stars out of ten.

Meanwhile the Enterprise, commanded by Scotty, has been called away by a distress call, apparently from a freighter under attack from Klingons.This is a fairly standard 'aliens with different cultures' episode although it is nice to see the dastardly Klingons again. The Capellans were entertaining enough although their dress sense is a little strange! Guest star is good as Eleen, the old leader's wife. The scenes between her and DeForest Kelley's McCoy were fun as a closeness developed between then although I'm not sure if the scene where he finally gets her to trust him by slapping her would have been acceptable if it was made now! Some unintentional humour is provided by the speed of the red shirt's demise and there are some enjoyable action scenes as Spock and Kirk use bows and arrows to defend themselves. James Doohan has a bit more to do than usual as Scotty and even though we can guess the distress call is a fake the scenes on the ship where they discuss whether to call off the search were well handled.

Akaar (Ben Gage) is leader of the Capellans, but Maab (Michael Dante) is influenced by Klingon visitor, Kras (Tige Andrews), to usurp the throne and take it. Maab leads his men in a successful rebellion that overthrows Akaar, killing him and his men, while Kirk, Spock, and Bones are forced to eventually flee (with Akaar's very pregnant wife, Eleen (Julie Newmar, not the sexpot she'd be recognized as on Batman and other projects)). Kras sees the deaths of the Federation's finest as quite the notch on his belt, but ultimately he wants the mineral rights, as a Klingon cruiser is somewhere near the planet. Scotty is in charge of the Enterprise while Kirk, Spock, and Bones try to find a location of safety while on the lam as Maab, Kras, and other Capellan warriors give chase. A distress signal draws the Enterprise away from the planet, but Scotty soon realizes that it is false, bogus chicanery by the Klingon cruiser. Finding a cave, Kirk and Spock can fashion medieval weapons (bow and arrows) while Bones delivers Eleen's unwanted child. Eleen wants to die since Akaar is dead, but Kirk prevents it, nearly perishing in the process. The planet is hot, dry, and barren, with hills and peaks, so the cat and mouse isn't easy for Kirk and company while a bomb causing collision and a strategic attack keep them just out of harm's way. Eleen isn't exactly the easiest company for our heroes, even leaving the safety of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and her newborn, surrendering herself to Maab. While Maab and the Capellans live by honesty and violence, Kras isn't above stabbing them each in the back or securing a Federation phaser to blast one of them.It is really fun seeing Scotty in command, with Uhura, Chekov, and Sulu on the Bridge assisting him during their orbit and answer of the distress signal, with plenty of analysis and intuition involved. Meanwhile you have the Three (well, the fourth is a redshirt quickly dispatched when he sees Kras and draws his phaser) dealing with the climate and natural landscape of the planet, titanic Capellans who are purposely presented as very tall and imposing (despite their rather laughable, unflattering attire), and treacherous, slimy Kras, with no honor or dignity, just wanting to take whatever his Klingons desire. The kligat is a type of throwing star favoring similarly to the boomerang which the Capellans use as a weapon, along with their daggers. Kras is almost vanquished early by Kirk, saved by Maab. Eleen is a walking contradictionshe offers her life to be taken yet wants to live. Newmar speaks as the Capellansstone-faced and with primitive words. Spock's reaction to what Eleen names her newborn as Kirk and Bones gloat is priceless. Fascinating scene has Eleen slapping Bones for trying to feel of her stomach to verify the baby's condition, with him taking a few shots before offering one across her face for good measure! Predictable conclusion, as Kras is certain to get his. Scotty challenging the Klingon cruiser and them wanting none of the Enterprise, while Kras proves time and again he's a weasel, is quite a contrast to the warriors of Worf's erahell, the Klingons of Kirk are completely different than that of Picard!

A change in power occurs on Capella IV mid-negotiation as the leader is killed by a mutineer. The mutineer takes kindly to the Vulcans. Captain Kirk & Co. are ordered to death when Kirk intervenes on the attempted killing of the former leader's pregnant wife by the new teer. The gang escapes with the pregnant lady in tow and heads for the hills, awaiting a rescue. Meanwhile the Enterprise, commanded by Scotty, has left orbit due to a distress signal from a nearby Earth freighter. The signal turns out to be fake, a distraction by the Vulcan ship. On the surface, Eleen has her baby (with the help of her new friend McCoy) in a cave before running away and attempting to sacrifice herself for the good of the others. A big fight happens, the crew versus the Capellans and the Klingon representative. The Klingon loses his cool in the heat of battle and turns on everyone. He is eventually killed along with the mutineer. Eleen takes over control of Capella IV in the name of her newborn son, the Enterprise confirms the mining contract, and everyone lives happily ever after.Anytime Captain Kirk is running into the Klingons, it's going to be an exciting time. Each episode is almost like its own little proxy war between the two sides. I enjoy that they never even name the Klingon until the credits, he's just there as a device of evil. I also enjoy the concept of these rudimentary, giant brutes known as the Capellans. Their outfits are a bit silly but their demeanor is silly as well! This warrior tribe seems to identify more with the Klingons but in the end it is Kirk that is able to secure the contract.This episode's a bit of a dumb little romp but I like it. There's a few cringeworthy moments (McCoy's ""Kootchie-coo"" comes to mind) but there's a lot to like: Scotty in control of the ship and getting some real screentime, a few fun little action scenes, etc. I also think this is one of the more Bones-focused episodes I can think of. It does a lot for his character development. Up until now, I've never really been a big fan of him; he's always giving Spock a hard time and gets a little too much too handle for me.

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. After a good run on its first season, the second season has more expectations to fulfill and hopefully they will try to develop the character a bit more and focus on the relations between the crew members on the enterprise to blend in and communicate easily with the audience despite of just focusing on more mind-numb missions that sometimes feel like they are filling their time and work in.It's always intriguing when the enterprise members interferes with the ongoing politics issues or war and addition to that, it had emotion filled in with all of it and even though the action sequences aren't that good, it works for the most part of it.",
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Deadly Years (TV Episode 1967)",Senility Strikes Kirk and his Officers,"You're not sure whether you should be sad or laughing during the course of this episode - but usually you'll laugh; it's hard not to these days. Of course, if you've ever had a parent or other close relative going through something like dementia, for example, it may give you pause. But then again, this is escapist fare - you're not supposed to take it too seriously. The Enterprise crew encounter the latest unknown space disease, a form of aging. The cause turns out to be radiation left over from a passing comet. Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty and a female junior officer all start to age very rapidly, on the order of 30 years per day. But people age differently and the female is the first to bite the dust, this episode's expendable crew member (as opposed to the usual red-shirt). Chekov was not affected at the site of the exposure for some reason and is the key to finding a solution. There's a commodore aboard, as it happens, and he quickly makes a nuisance of himself, forcing a competency hearing against Kirk (should they really have time for this with such a deadline fast approaching?).The episode manages to touch upon the fears and drawbacks of getting older, mostly from Kirk's perspective. It shows that the best one can expect as one becomes elderly is probably pity - from those who used to respect you. The affected party ages mentally even swifter than they do physically, so there are numerous scenes of Kirk being forgetful; these begin quite early, in subtle hints that all is not right with the landing party. When Kirk starts dozing in his command chair, his loyal crew looking on bewildered and embarrassed, the time for subtlety is past and the audience may stifle an uncomfortable laugh, unless they enjoy a kind of payback for all of Kirk's virile past gallivanting. The physical make-up, however, leaves something to be desired; Kirk & Spock aren't too bad, but Scotty acquires an odd mummified look, while someone placed a mop-like strange hairpiece on McCoy's head. Again, the viewer probably shouldn't laugh too much looking at these heroes deteriorate, but it's taken out of our hands due to the presentation. The central competency hearing, conducted by Spock, repeats much of what had occurred up until this point and winds up being tedious.But Shatner is great in every scene he's in: his outrage, at the hearing and, later, at Spock; his annoyance with commodore Stocker; his wandering mind, no longer fine tuned; his denial, obviously from plain fear. Kelley also turns in a great interpretation of a doddering old country doctor. Nimoy merely plays a Vulcan who seems tired all the time. Towards the climax, I found it difficult to understand how even a 'deskbound paper-pusher' like commodore Stocker would commit as grievous a blunder as he does here in regards to the Romulan Neutral Zone, but some crisis was needed to test the rejuvenated Kirk in full rescue mode. These scenes also consisted of stock footage of a Romulan ship firing its weapon from the ""Balance of Terror"" episode and lasted so long that the Enterprise should have been obliterated well before Kirk rushed up to the bridge to pull his fast one with corbomite again (see ""The Corbomite Maneuver"" from way back).",7
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Deadly Years (TV Episode 1967)",Star Trek ages gracefully,"I'm totally impressed by the makeup job for the landing party characters (with the exception of the aged Lt. Galway, who looks pretty fake). Kirk, McCoy and Scotty REALLY DO look old, especially McCoy. I'm not sure today's makeup artists could do a better job of making someone appear 30-40 years older. And the acting jobs by Shatner, Nimoy, Kelley and Doohan are top notch. They ACT like they're old...especially McCoy, who is even crustier than ever in old age and has his southern drawl magnified. One note, however: Kirk appears to be balding pretty bad when he's ""between the ages of 60-72,"" but he actually has MORE hair at the end when he's gotta be in his 80s. ""The Deadly Years"" is an all-around solid episode. The script is well-conceived, the makeup is excellent, and the actors give arguably their best performance of the series. There are a lot of other TV shows that have an episode where the main characters are really old (Cheers, The Brady Bunch), but they never seem very convincing. In ""The Deadly Years,"" I really felt like Kirk and company were 30 years older. There are several episodes I like better, but this episode definitely makes my Top 20 list.

As things get worse, the Commodore takes over the ship and blunders into the neutral zone.The problem with this episode is that it started out with a poor premise and never really improved its plot at all. It is predictable, and even recycles a plot device from the first season in the most obvious manner possible. The episode is decently directed scripted, shot and acted. But it started out with questionable material and those involved could only do so much to improve upon what they were given.",5
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Deadly Years (TV Episode 1967)",Generally weak episode with a strong finish,"This is not one of the better Trek episodes. Star Trek stands out for its emphasis on its characters, and several act well out of character in this episode. But it's rescued by its ending.Yes, Chekov is young, inexperienced and somewhat hot-headed (see Trouble with Tribbles) but his sheer terror on finding the dead scientist just isn't very believable.While Kirk would no doubt resist any suggestion that he's no longer fit for command, so much of his character is built around sacrificing himself heroically for his ship that he would have readily stepped down with a little convincing that he had a problem. He certainly wouldn't have been relieved involuntarily after a long and rather dull competency hearing in which he makes a fool of himself.Commodore Stocker is the most unbelievable character of all. He might be a chair-bound paper pusher, as Kirk says, but it is simply not at all credible that any Starfleet officer, much less one of such high rank, would be so utterly boneheaded as to violate the Romulan Neutral Zone just to get to his new job. (Then again, Captain Schettino was somehow hired by Costa Cruises, so maybe ship staffing fiascoes by upper management still happen in the 23rd century).Yet this does set the episode up for one of the more satisfying endings; it's more common to see a promising Trek episode end with a whimper. It was fun to see Kirk reuse his classic Corbomite bluff, this time in clever combination with a Starfleet code known to have been broken by the Romulans, but which fact the Romulans apparently didn't know yet.And it's been kinda fun to compare the ""aged"" characters with the actors in real-life old age.

It seems that some virus or something is making them all age extremely rapidly and soon this also affects the landing party (with the exception of Chekov). When they return to the ship, these effects of aging are first noticed, but the odd malady does not spread to the rest of the crew--just those who visited the planet. Rather quickly, senility and arthritis set in and soon a ""red shirt"" crew member dies--all the while, Chekov is inexplicably fine! The show has a creative plot and is pretty well-written and stand up as a decent episode--not super-memorable but not bad at all.

The landing party (sans Chekov) soon find themselves aging at an extraordinary pace. Spock, Bones, and Dr. Wallace (an old flame of Captain Kirk's) must find out what is causing the rapid aging before it's too late! Making matters more difficult is Commodore Stocker, on board hitching a ride to a different colony. He seizes command from a dithering, forgetful-prone Kirk as the aging takes a serious effect on him. Stocker decides to take a shortcut through the neutral zone, jeopardizing the Enterprise in Romulan territory.So it turns out that the culprit is a strange type of radiation that went undetected before. The remedy comes just in time! Kirk gets an injection and re-establishes himself as captain as Stocker struggles to cope with a Romulan attack. Kirk cleverly outwits the Romulans by sending Star Fleet a coded message about how it will self-destruct in defense against the Romulan ships that have surrounded the Enterprise. Kirk knows that the Romulans recently decoded this encryption type. The Romulans, alarmed by the Enterprises self-destruct capability back off temporarily, allowing the Enterprise to jump to warp, escaping back into Federation territory in the nick of time. The crew is reverted to their normal selves (besides one causality) and head off for their next adventure.I'm not quite sure what to make of this episode. The idea itself is actually pretty neat! Rapid aging is a nefariously horrifying thing to imagine. Unfortunately, the episode does a bad job of making the most out of it. The actors playing the crew affected by the radiation never feel like they truly commit to turning into the elderly. They mostly seem like young people in their posture and mannerisms. I would have liked to see them really go for it.I think the main issue with the episode though is the court room scene. It really slows down the pace of the episode and feels like a complete waste of time as these men have hours left remaining to live! Go figure out how to solve this crisis! The entire scene feels like someone trying to make the word count of their essay. We go over testimonies and statements that we watched live minutes earlier. Why are we replaying them? It's also clear that Kirk is no longer mentally capable of maintaining command of the Enterprise. Sulu (who I'm assuming is next in command after Kirk, Spock, and Scotty) should have taken over. Of the landing party, Chekov is the only one not to be affected. Why? Because he got spooked! I think this is absolutely silly but whatever. It also feels weird that they took one female in the landing party and she happens to be the only one that dies...The one thing I did like though was the clever ploy by Kirk. It's set up earlier in the episode and is a great bit of screenwriting. You think that they include Uhura's mentioning of the code-breaking to highlight Kirk's forgetfulness, but really it is to set up the big finale! Loved that!Besides this little wrinkle though, I wasn't too big a fan of this episode. It's a bit slow, it has a weird subplot about how Kirk's ex is attracted to him again because she has a fetish for old people. I don't know, this episode's bizarre, but probably worth seeing.",6

Kirk, McCoy, Scotty, and Spock aging rapidly, in old age makeup, losing their mental faculties to increasing senility, as the Romulans engage the Enterprise while a Commodore Stocker (Charles Drake) assumes, oh so reluctantly, command is all the plot you need to make for great entertainment. But you have Stocker, making the decision uncomfortably, appealing to Spock to remove Kirk from command after the captain forgets actions he had previously made, falling asleep at his chair on the Bridge, and barking at his officers for questioning his orders after he had made them moments prior. The captain competency hearing where an elderly Kirk angrily and curmudgeonly groans at the gall of this ""fiasco"", with Spock conducting it logically, of course, and the officers achingly must admit that he has begun to fail. So an away team beams down to a colony on a planet near the Neutral Zone, with Chekov freaking out after discovering the dead body of a Federation science officer who perished due to ""extreme old age"". Kirk and company (including a female officer) encounter a married couple, in their twenties, with bodies aged to their 80s! Soon to realize that a comet that passed through orbit causing a unique form of radiation was behind the rapid aging (thirty years a day, Bones believes), Kirk, Spock, Bones, and Scotty (the female officer succumbs to old age due to her metabolism, hearing loss her major hindrance) will need to discover a reason why Chekov hasn't if they are to survive. Meanwhile Stocker is nervous about getting to a starbase on time, assuming the captain's chair he just isn't prepared for, so he takes the Enterprise on a ""detour course"" right into the Neutral Zone, instigating a host of Romulan ships to attack. Finding out how Chekov's scared reaction kept him from aging will be the key to combating the radiation sickness. Bones - with his thick-accent hickish ""country doctor"" shtick after becoming a snarly old man - in that distinctive wrinkly makeup, had me in ribbons. Kirk combative towards those wanting to rip his command away from him, telling Spock to get out of his sight when he believes his dear friend had stabbed him in the back is just too a sight to behold. Scotty, tired and weakened, wants to be able to work in engineering but sleep and rest beckon him. Spock's body malfunctioning in temperature, with his mental strength eroding, is a cause for alarm. This episode does comment on ""age on trial"", and strokes Shatner's ego in regards to how Kirk is the only one who could guide his ship out of the hostile situation of a Romulan victory over the Enterprise, as Stocker fails miserably. The ole ""auto destruct"" failsafe trick Kirk has as an ace up his sleeve, just needing some space to warp out of harm's way. The Romulan ships on the offensive, with the Enterprise taking heavy fire, there's action to go with the aging plot. Exciting and imaginative, ""The Deadly Years"" is Trek at its best, in its prime. Sarah Marshall is yet another love interest for Kirk, from a romance between them in the past.",9

Back on the Enterprise it isn't long before members of the away team, with the exception of Chekov, start aging. At first the signs are subtle; Kirk gives the same order twice and instructs Uhura to contact Star Fleet using a code that has already been cracked by the Romulans. It isn't long before more obvious signs of aging show and if they don't discover the cause and a remedy quickly most of the senior staff will be dead within days! As time progresses Kirk's ability to command comes into question and Commodore Stocker, who was being transported to a nearby star base, assumes command despite never serving on a star ship before. This almost leads to disaster when he orders the Enterprise to head directly to the star base even though that course takes then through the Romulan neutral zone.This episode is surprisingly effective; the danger might not be visible but it is more tangible than alien threats after all we all grow old and the fear of losing one's faculties something everybody can understand. The aging make-up is pretty good although they are stated to be around seventy yet look and act considerably older; perhaps our attitude to what 'old' means has changed in the last fifty years! The cause of the very rapid aging is a bit far-fetched and the cure is even more unlikely as it appears to fully reverse the aging in a matter of minutes! The cast does a fine job; William Shatner is particularly good as we see Capt. Kirk gradually losing his mental sharpness; one can't help feeling sorry for the character even though it is clear that he is losing his ability to command. If this wasn't enough drama we get an exciting confrontation with the Romulans! Overall a pretty good episode despite certain obvious flaws.",8

""The Deadly Years"", however, has withstood the test of time and is as engaging as it ever was. I believe the graceful aging of this episode is a result of a few things: 1. Good acting. It's hard for a young actor to convincingly and seriously portray a decrepit old man without turning it into farce, but the cast did a fine job here.2.

Basically, a landing party is exposed to some strange radiation that causes all of them (except Chekhov for some reason) to age at an immensely accelerated rate. Rather than do the sensible thing and go straight to a nearby Starbase with better scientific facilities, Kirk stubbornly refuses to leave, even though he and his two chief scientific officers in this area (Spock and McCoy) are rapidly losing their ability to function.The part where the Commodore orders the Enterprise across the Neutral Zone, though, is just silly. The excuse that he has 'never commanded a starship before' hardly explains why he would act like a complete moron without an ounce of common sense. I know they had to create a situation to allow Kirk to dramatically regain control and save the ship, but the ruse used here was also rather silly and much too pat.I agree with the other reviewer that this episode is uncomfortable because it makes the elderly seem like doddering buffoons. This seems grossly exaggerated for dramatic purposes-- even at age 60-72, I doubt Kirk would be that decrepit. But, exaggerated as it is, it does highlight the horrific fact that the debilitating effects of aging can't be avoided, by anyone. This reviewer first saw this episode several decades ago and found it mildly amusing, but it is less so now, even though he isn't anywhere near that age yet.",5

It would have really been something if they had him drooling in his breakfast cereal, but that would probably have taken things a bit too far. Still, nice job Captain.Well with the crew getting grayer by the minute, this one needed a solution before the full fifty minutes of air time expired. The adrenaline fix seemed somewhat contrived, but they had to come up with something. It was a little bit of lazy writing for the rejuvenated Kirk to pull the old Corbomite Maneuver out of his sleeve once again, but if you hadn't seen that episode, or forgot about it, that was a decent resolution.

Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. After a good run on its first season, the second season has more expectations to fulfill and hopefully they will try to develop the character a bit more and focus on the relations between the crew members on the enterprise to blend in and communicate easily with the audience despite of just focusing on more mind-numb missions that sometimes feel like they are filling their time and work in.The Deadly Years has one of those goofy fun kind of premise that is predictable and familiar yet still works like a charm to which the credit goes to the writer as they indulge typical character drama and their equation among other crew members that helps one enjoy it more than it had potential to.",

Besides, who wants to watch the crew age and get decrepit? Entertainment value zero.To make things even worse - i.e. dumber in this case - we have yet another high-ranking Federation character who makes all the wrong choices and displays the typical arrogance that Roddenberry & Co for some reason deem it necessary for them to have. That makes no sense, however: if the Federation's top echelon are such incompetent, arrogant and self-destructive knuckleheads then how does that match this supposedly quite peaceful, wonderful, progressive 23rd-century future? In other words, with such people in charge, the Federation should be much more akin to Darth Vader's Empire.

Interesting that that particular rank was revived for Star Fleet, the US Navy hasn't used it for years up to this century. Drake is a passenger on his way to a star base and he orders Nimoy to order a competency hearing at which Shatner fails.This episode cheats a bit because after a cure is found Shatner shows his usual skill of command by outwitting some Romulans after the Enterprise crosses the neutral zone.

First of all, the characters look really weird as they age. Secondly, even if their bodies age, why are their minds suddenly compromised. For instance, their speech patterns and vocal qualities begin to morph into stereotypical geriatric grumblings. McCoy sounds like a character out of a Mark Twain novel. The old country doctor. Kirk is doddering and forgetful. These are things that grow out of life experiences, not a few days of aging. If you turned from 40 to 80 overnight, your body would change, but your mind would continue to function as usual. As is usually the case, the conclusion is pretty much standard fair.

0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Obsession (TV Episode 1967)",Star Trek Horror,"Obsession offers a very extraordinary antagonist--a ""monster"" that's an intelligent gas, made of an element that's not supposed to exist ""naturally"", and that's able to transform itself as a means of camouflage. Although there are some very broad parallels to this idea in other episodes, including Who Mourns for Adonais?, the material is handled very uniquely here.We are also presented with an intriguing and unusual exploration of Captain Kirk's psychology, and through that, a bit of Starfleet history. Kirk is the source of the title, Obsession. He harbors deeply buried guilt, stemming from an incident on another ship when he was still a junior officer. His guilt suddenly rises to the surface after encountering this episode's antagonist. Because of this, he becomes obsessed with conquering the ""monster"", and it affects his judgments seriously enough that his command of the Enterprise is threatened.As good as it was, the original Star Trek didn't often get close to more gut-level, scary horror material. This episode does, largely because the antagonist is unpredictable, shape shifting and nearly invisible much of the time. It functions as more of a generalized token of a threat to one's life force, made more literal in the way that the ""monster"" attacks its victims and sustains itself. At times, Obsession's structure and content--including emotional content, almost resemble later horror sci-fi like Alien (1979), which could have easily been influenced by it.This episode is also notable for some extended, unusual cooperation and agreement between Spock and McCoy.",10
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Obsession (TV Episode 1967)","""Obssessed!?""","Sayeth Captain James T. Kirk to his good friend a chief medical officer Doctor Leonard McCoy.Or, Trek does Herman Melville. I remember seeing ""Moby Dick"" on TV quite a few times, and even the mid late 1970s iteration with Richard Harris and Bo Derek with Shamu in the antagonistic role of ""Orca"". So it is that I never really fully absorbed this episode until a few years back when I bought the first DVD publication of the classic Star Trek series.It's a story about pining for a second chance, and, as the title states, obsessing about that second chance when it's presented. But the story also makes clear that the decisions we make, we make out of the best judgment we have at the time. As my former coworker told me one time ""Could've, would've, should've, who knows?"", and that's what the author of this screenplay is telling the audience. The author even goes a step further and seals the deal with a definite answer for both characters and audience by stating what would have happened.This story hit home for me when I first popped it in my DVD player. I grew up with Trek as a kid, and reflecting on my own past experiences, I can truly appreciate this story and its parable for what it is, and embrace the full value of the message. Sometimes we go through life with an astonishing amount of regrets, berating our past performances for not achieving the goals we strove for. But, as long as we gave our full best effort at the time, it is reasonable to expect any better result? In the US we call it Monday-Morning quarterbacking; i.e. looking at a game of American ""Football"", and critiquing the mistakes of who made what decisions, and the impacts thereof. We learn from our mistakes, but how much dissection is healthy? Or, to put it in simpler language, do we really need to beat ourselves up for something over which we had no control?Production Values; the monster is what it is--a cloud. Animated at some times, dry ice sunk in a pale of water at other times. It's not the most abhorrent or scary of creatures to look at, but it does give one pause when we consider its capabilities, and its true nature. In other words, again another fantastic sci-fi story carries forward some slight of hand special effects. We know what we're looking at, but the attributes of the monster as explained in the dialog and scene action and description, are what carry the story forward.Again, this is the genius of shows like Star Trek. The material future may be the polar opposite of dystopic, but it's the forces inside us meeting the challenges without that create our own spiritual and psychological desolation. This episode, like all good TV, lets us vicariously travel that path as Kirk and crew address a menace to 23rd Century space lanes; a sociopathic (or perhaps just callous and uncaring) sentient that has its own priorities: Survival.And here again we're given a pretty harsh story on top of that. In a galaxy and universe like Star Trek, where the usual baddies come in the form of Klingons or misunderstood (sometimes super powerful) alien races, will there always be room for a heart to heart negotiated settlement? And what will the ramifications of that be like? This too is worth pondering.Gripping, mysterious, somewhat belabored in the subplot department, but a good watch all the same.Enjoy.",

Soon, Kirk's obsessive behavior regarding the gas cloud has the crew questioning his sanity.Ralph Senensky's direction keeps this classic Shatner episode tight, exciting, and well shot. There are many memorable scenes and the script allows for some very good character development for the young ensign as well as the principal cast members. And unlike the standard Star Trek Space Monster story, this ends up being as much a human-military (naval) drama as it is an adventure tale.",9
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Obsession (TV Episode 1967)",It can't possibly exist...but it Does!,"Will we ever be free of our monsters, even in the 23rd century? This episode says of course not and, especially in view of what we've seen of the 24th century on the TNG show and other spin-offs, there will always be space-age demons and goblins to terrorize us. Following up on commodore Decker's Ahab-like role on ""The Doomsday Machine,"" now it's Kirk's turn to confront and obsess about his personal devil. Yet, his nemesis, in a key revelatory point of the story, is not some unthinking machine; it really is a predatory monster, killing off red-shirts left and right, like a space-faring shark with malicious tendencies (it breaks the record of red-shirt deaths in ""The Apple,"" even if one of these happen off-screen). Shatner gets to show a bit more range than usual here; he doesn't go off completely half-cocked or deranged, but there's enough edginess in him here to warrant McCoy & Spock briefly teaming up against him, recalling the key scene in ""The Conscience of a King."" The story does drive home one point probably a couple of times too many: that Kirk's guilt over not killing the creature years earlier is groundless. McCoy's scene with Kirk, where he points out his captain's possibly overly obsessive approach to the problem, is very good. But then we have Spock going over this ground over and over, it seems, both with Kirk & ensign Garrovick, another guilt-ridden character. Yes, the parallels of what's currently happening in this episode and events of several years ago on the starship Farragut are somewhat eerie, but enough already, Spock. Stop beating the audience over the head with it. Despite this clumsy aspect to story construction, it's a fairly exciting, suspenseful riff on the dangers lurking in outer space, even in Trek's quasi-utopia future. Much later, Captain Picard would be accused of Ahab-like behavior in ""Star Trek-First Contact""(96) involving, what else, the Borg. This seems a prevalent theme among starship captains of the Trek mythos.",8

Reminding him of that fact is a new ensign assigned to the Enterprise, the son of the late commander of the Farragut played by Stephen Brooks. It's with some mixed emotions that William Shatner deals with Brooks.Complicating things is the fact that the Enterprise is on a critical rescue mission already when Shatner commits his vessel to fighting the creature. Something that for once Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley are in agreement on and question Shatner's judgment. Shatner shines in this Star Trek story of the difficulties of command and the problem of weighing both priorities and options. Trekkies will love this one.",7

Really? No doubt intuition plays a role in forming critical judgments, but unless you have some solid facts backing you up, you'd have a hard time defending yourself if your decision was the wrong one. The Captain would have been all by himself in front of a real Federation competency hearing if his 'obsession' cost the lives of the Enterprise crew. Or maybe he would have died along with them. Interesting to speculate.But the hero of the show is allowed some latitude to be wrong as long as he winds up right in the end. Somehow I didn't think the script played fair with everything we've come to know of Captain Kirk up to this point in the second season. The development of his character generally called for a level headed commander who wouldn't have taken the chances he did here. What I liked about this story though was the way it worked a little more information about Kirk's background and training into the mix, setting up the inevitable comparison with Ensign Garrovick (Stephen Brooks), now in the same kind of spot Kirk found himself in eleven years earlier. Too coincidental that Garrovick's Dad was Kirk's first commanding officer, but that's a standard plot device.Watch closely as the camera comes in on the first red shirt victim at the start of the story - his eyes twitch slightly.

Instead of the usual clear-thinking stud, this time he's a bit obsessed and the crew begin to doubt his objectivity and even sanity as he risks it all to destroy a cloud that destroys by sucking the life over areas it occupies! Kirk is concerned that if the creature isn't stopped at all costs, that many, many more will die--plus, he remembers this same creature that attacked his settlement years earlier and killed many of his loved ones. Negatives about the show were the over-acting by Shatner and rather dullness of the plot. It just didn't seem all that engaging--probably because fighting a cloud just isn't all that interesting.

When Kirk was an ensign on the Farragut, the cloud attacked and killed a number of his crew members, including his captain. What haunts him is that he froze momentarily, failing to fire his phaser. Not that it would have done any good, anyways. Good part for Stephen Brooks as the Farragut captain's son, now an officer on the Enterprise. He freezes just like Kirk did when an away team beams down to a planet the Federation is interested in for a particular strong mineral looking for the cloud, with one officer dead, another fatally drained, near death. Kirk battles his inner demons and faces an obsessive desire to kill the creature he considers intelligent, needing Spock to agree/confirm. Bones challenges him often in the episode, addressing whether or not his actions will delay shipment of medical supplies where they are needed elsewhere just to conquer a ghost from the past, annihilating the cloud at the cost of lives his quest jeopardizes. Spock's Vulcan blood, containing copper instead of iron, repulses the cloud and that just might be the answer. Antimatter once again is Kirk's go-to weapon, but he'll need to attract the cloud his way, with Brooks accompanying him to a planet for one final showdown. Seeing Kirk contending with a passionate need to vanquish a creature he considers evil, as his friends are concerned for his mental well- being lends itself to fireworks, and this gives Shather complexity to chew the fat on. Spock confronting the kid Kirk confines to quarters (for the slight mistake freezing) about not accepting failure, wallowing in the agony of it, is a good little scene as are Bones' confrontations with Kirk over the obsession. Dealing with the past, and closing that chapter on a high note, allows Kirk to put it behind him. And a young officer can be salvaged in the process, not having to live with his own shortcoming as long as Kirk did. Kirk snapping off at his crew, revealing a troubled soul needing a salve for his emotional wounds shows a vulnerability perfect for dramatic effect, his character tested and persevering. The cloud gives off a sickly sweet honey smell that tips off its presence, and the attraction to hemoglobin gives Kirk some advantage in bait.",9

Smelling it on the planet he is surveying, all the sensations come flooding back to him as a pair of his crewman perish at its behalf, getting the blood sucked out of them. The son of Kirk's old commanding officer who was killed by this cloud is now a member of Enterprise's security detail. Him and Kirk pursue the cloud but Garrovick freezes in the moment, costing more lives to be lost. A skeptical Spock and Bones want the Enterprise to get back on track and rendezvous with the USS Yorktown to deliver medical supplies to an ailing planet. Instead, Kirk pursues the cloud as it heads off into space.The cloud attacks the Enterprise, getting into the ship and slipping into the ventilation. A frustrated Garrovick leaves a vent open accidentally and the cloud attacks Spock but is uninterested in his green blood. The Enterprise heads back to where it all began, the planet where Kirk first met it. He feels a connection to the cloud and for some reason knows that this is its home. Kirk plants a powerful antimatter bomb on the surface with the help of Garrovick. They lure it into a trap and transport back to the ship just in time, seemingly killing the cloud. Another day, another adventure!Ralph Senesky directed this episode. I find this interesting because he also directed the episode ""Metamorphosis"", another cloud-centric episode. He only directed 6 episodes in total so I think it's odd that 33% of his Star Trek work is about clouds attacking members of the crew.Anyways... This episode plays out a bit like a horror show (as other reviews have noted). The monster is this unidentifiable, spirit-like being that slowly comes at the Enterprise, impervious to all weaponry. It's one of the spookier images you'll get from this show. Unfortunately, there's only so much you can do with a cloud as your enemy so script ideas are a bit limited. (""I don't know? We blow it up? Sure!) The episode falls apart a bit towards the conclusion.My favorite aspect of this episode is the parallels between Kirk and young Garrovick: both are strong-headed, trying to always play the hero, hard on themselves, and have serious beef with this cloud. It would have been cool to see him featured a bit more on the show as Kirk's young protégé.

Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. After a good run on its first season, the second season has more expectations to fulfill and hopefully they will try to develop the character a bit more and focus on the relations between the crew members on the enterprise to blend in and communicate easily with the audience despite of just focusing on more mind-numb missions that sometimes feel like they are filling their time and work in.As the title suggests, the obsession isn't expressed to the extent as it should have for it would given more gravitas to William Shatner's character and helped a lot on better impact and effortless execution which is a window that doesn't come often, but overall it still is a good one.",
14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Obsession (TV Episode 1967)",What the hell was this fog vampire doing for the past 11 years since Kirk saw it the first time?,"Ok, trek fan here. I only like the original tv series. I hate the other tv series and all the movies. Real rating for this episode is a passing grade, worth the watch. But still a C rating, with 5 stars at best. 1 star given for balance.
Here's the big problem: What the hell was this fog vampire doing for the past 11 years since Kirk saw it the first time?
What was it doing on the first plant? There was no blood there to be consumed. Why didn't it kill all the first landing part, and just run away? Kirk should have been toast. Ok, it's a tv show, and we all love star trek so we have to make compensations.
But reading all the reviews here people seem to miss some plot problems. The title: Obsession. Ok, so we see Kirk getting obsessed. It's not really obsession, he knows the threat and it must be killed. Better if he made it clear to his men what they were dealing with rather than asking them to read the tapes. Kirk confines the security chief to his quarters because he froze. Once he realized that it wouldn't have made a difference if he fired or not he releases the security chief. This doesn't make sense, the man froze, just like Kirk froze years earlier. What if they encounter a different threat later that could have been killed by firing. The man froze, and Kirk froze. When Spock tells that to Kirk, that's fine. But then Spock makes a special visit to the security chief, in the middle of the crisis, to give the man comfort, this is ridiculous. Some serious rewrites were required. 
I hate this story. Too many questions. We don't need to know where this thing came from or what it is. But what was it doing for the past 11 years. And why was it on that planet, that was not inhabited with blood soaked creatures. Makes no sense. 
The acting was great. The problem is the plot/script. Real rating is a passing C, or 5 stars. 1 star for balance. Better to watch Doomsday machine.",1
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Obsession (TV Episode 1967)",Kirk vs The Intelligent Fog,"Season 2, episode 13. The Enterprise is at a planet in search of tritanium deposits. Kirk and away team has beamed down... while searching Kirk catches a whiff of a sickening sweet honey smell that he immediately recognizes from 11 years prior. He splits up the away team to search for and destroy it. The red shirts are attacked and killed but one that is dying - their red blood cells are drained of hemoglobin. Once they all beam aboard, Kirk becomes obsessed with hunting down that create and destroying it while ignoring Starfleet orders to rendezvous with the USS Yorktown. Kirk keeps insisting the creature is intelligent while Spock and McCoy have their doubts in the beginning thinking the captain is loosing his mind from a guilty feeling of all dying but him 11 years prior to this encounter with the creature. Kirk must destroy this creature once and for all.3 things are illogical or do not make a lot of sense in this episode: 1) Spock has mentioned in other episodes that he ""senses"" yet he finds sensing or intuition illogical in this particular episode. Why would he find it illogical that humans can sense things or is it simply any type of sensing illogical to him? 2) Why would the always logical Spock put his hands in front of a vent as if that would stop the fog creature? Yes he reversed the vent output aka blocked the vent so the creature could not enter into the room with him but putting both hands in front of the vent is a very illogical move for a Vulcan... well he is half human so maybe the human side of him responded in this case? 3) Why were they searching for for tritanium deposits to begin with on the planet when they were to rendezvous with the USS Yorktown to transfer urgent medical supplies destined for Theta VII? If those medical supplies were so urgent then why search for those tritanium deposits? That in itself should have had Spock reminding the captain of the urgent supplies before they beamed to the planet's surface. Kirk was clearly ignoring his priority orders.In spite of it's flaws, the episode is fun to watch. I find even lesser episodes a great joy to view and fascinating. ;) 7/10",7
16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Obsession (TV Episode 1967)",Kirk must kill his great white gas-monster,"While on an uninhabited planet looking for essential minerals Capt. Kirk notices a strange sweet odour; an odour he has smelt before. Rather than beam out he orders a trio of red shirts to investigate and soon two are dead and one is seriously injured after a gaseous entity removed their red blood corpuscles. The Enterprise is due to rendezvous with another ship to transport urgently needed perishable medical supplies but Kirk decides to remain in orbit, obsessed with destroying the entity. It turns out that Kirk has encountered it before; on his first mission as a new officer; when he hesitated before opening fire. He still blames himself for the deaths of half the people on that ship. After another fatal encounter on the planet the entity heads off into space and Kirk orders the Enterprise to give chase; it is only when it turns and attacks the Enterprise that Spock accepts it is indeed a sentient being.This is a decent enough episode although there was no prior hint that Kirk was the sort of man who would be recklessly obsessive yet here we are expected to believe that he would abandon an urgent mission without even contacting Star Fleet about the entity. As other reviewers have stated the writers clearly wanted an episode where Kirk acted like Capt. Ahab in his pursuit if his great white whale. We also have to accept that his erratic behaviour wouldn't lead to his removal from command just as he removed a red shirt (coincidentally the son of Kirk's captain in the original mission) from duty for hesitating before firing. Still despite these faults I found myself enjoying the episode; William Shatner hams it up as Kirk delightfully and it was interesting to learn something about his early days in Star Fleet. Overall a flawed but enjoyable episode.",7
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Wolf in the Fold (TV Episode 1967)","Before CSI, there was Trek.","This episode gave me the creeps because I always liked Scotty. He wasn't Kirk, Spock nor McCoy. He made sure the Enterprise ran, and made miracles happen when the ship was in peril. He brought engines back from the grave, fixed transporters, weapons, and always warned the captain about the stress and strain the ship could take. But Kirk knew his engineer, and trusted him to push the Enterprise to the absolute limit without breaking her.But then this episode happens, and Scotty's integrity is put on the line. The one you least suspect is the primary suspect in a series of brutal criminal events. Is Scotty the culprit? Is our beloved Scottsman in fact the criminal which the Argelians seek? We're given some pretty fast moving elements, and given the planetary society we're introduced to, it's a good thing, because otherwise Mister Scott might've been locked up and executed before the episode was over.The story deals with objectifying the serial killer. Who and what is he? Where does he come from? How can he be? Is he truly one of us? A proverbial, as Spock puts it, ""wolf in the fold"" (the episode's title).None of those questions is answered, but a science fiction hypothesis is proposed as well as a real world hypothesis for why some killers act the way they do. And, in the end, we're treated to Star Fleet know how via Kirk and Spock who have a solution.The real magic of this episode is that with all of the weapons and personnel and technology at the disposal of Starfleet's finest, it's the captain and his officers who have to puzzle out what went on. And Kirk doesn't pull any punches in trying to get to the truth, including grilling his friend and chief engineer. They use the computer, but it can only serve as a tool. Kirk and crew have to puzzle out the real culprit.The episode gives a real heir of mystery and suspense in act two. No amount of scanning equipment or phasers set to either stun or kill is going to solve the mystery for them. And even when the mystery of who and how it solved, the question of why can only be postulated in a science fiction like venue. There are some theories as to why some serial killers do the things they do, and this episode really doesn't even begin to touch on them. It only states that such things have happened, and the best at the time is to try to puzzle out who did these horrendous acts of evil.The thing that got me about this episode, as I stated before, is that Kirk couldn't just rely on his department heads to whip up an answer based on his own theory. He does for a solution, but the problem was a real mystery. It was CSI in space, specifically on board the U.S.S. Enterprise, and Kirk plays a detective as well as a starship captain. It was scary in that we have a malevolent malefactor that exercises power of the most horrific kind. But again, it is Star Trek, and the solution actually does come in the form of scientific and engineering know how.A definite plus for Trek for venturing into yet another genre without having to rely on staples like phasers and Klingons. An exploration of an unknown and very frightening quantity in a specific segment of the criminal population; the most vile, the most hated, and the most feared. Again, fortunately it is Trek with Kirk and crew at the helm to solve another life threatening dilemma. If you're into the whole criminal fiction thing, then give this episode a whirl on your DVD player and see what you think. It may be a little incredulous, but hopefully you'll be somewhat impressed with the boundaries that Trek was willing to push and explore in terms of story and characters.Enjoy!",
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Wolf in the Fold (TV Episode 1967)",At least the green dancer wasn't the one killed.,"This is an interesting space detective episode but with gaps in the plot. Seems Scotty is now a woman-hater after an accident on the Enterprise so what does the ship's doctor and captain do? Why, take him to a belly-dancing show, of course! Scott then leaves with another man's fiancée (the dancer) and is later found unconscious and the woman dead. Later, more women are found killed with only Scotty in the room. We later learn from a séance that this is the work of an entity named Redjac who came to Earth and became Jack the Ripper. Red=blood, Jac= Jack the Ripper, get it? Anyway, Redjac is soon dealt with by being dispersed into space. My question is, did Redjac possess Scotty and kill the girls all those times thus explaining his memory loss or did that administrator knock Scotty unconscious TWICE in 3 different places and killed the women? That's a heck of a co-incidence for the killer to know where Scotty was in order to frame him. Still, the entity's howling when it takes over the Enterprise computer is chilling but seeing a serial killer on tranquilizers saying ""you're all going to die"" and giggling was quite funny. Not one of best episodes but very good nonetheless. See it for the dancer.",7

This must be murder! We begin with a belly dancer. What's this? Is this not Trek? Sure enough, there's Kirk, McCoy and a lusty Scotty watching the show, to the tune of an old Orion slave girl dance. Next thing we know, Scotty has knifed the poor girl to death in a mist-filled alley. Then he does it again, to a poor yeoman. And again, to a local mystic. All women. And him with a recent knock on the head, caused by a female crewmember. Yes, it must be him. Murder mystery solved! Well, not quite. Just one thing to mention before we go on, regarding the 2nd murder: Scotty is the main (and only) suspect at this point; so they send him downstairs to be alone with another female in a secluded chamber; sure enough, she's dead a minute later. But, what do I know? I've never conducted a murder investigation. I guess that's how it's done in the 23rd century.This is a fun, if trivial, episode, filled with some nice touches. The alien society here is one of the most peaceful we've ever seen but they still resort to ancient customs for dealing with murderers: death by slow torture. Cut to: Scotty 'gulp.' There's a central séance which manages to be spooky as the doomed clairvoyant describes the menace - evil, a hatred of all that lives, and so on. Then we learn about this entity which was known as Jack on Earth in the 19th century and which continued to kill every few decades as mankind spread to the stars. It's intriguing, copied by Stephen King for his magnum opus, 'It,' not to mention there was that Kolchak TV film ""The Night Strangler"" in '73 - though we never learn what this timeless creature did before its escapades as the Ripper. Then the crew all get space happy thanks to a special cocktail from McCoy and, as seems customary with many later Trek episodes, a grim tone is subverted to a playful one in the last act. The episode also generalizes the fear factor in females, making them the primary (and only) targets of this cosmic killer. At least the monstrous alien killer in ""Obsession"" was more diverse in its attacks - red-shirts! Stick to what you know, Trek!",7
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Wolf in the Fold (TV Episode 1967)",different and engaging,"An excellent second-season episode, 'Wolf in the Fold' resembles a good old-fashioned murder mystery more than anything. Written by Robert Bloch (author of 'Psycho'), it has a nice spooky feeling to it and a genuinely creepy ending that makes it unique among Trek installments. Scotty is suspected of murdering an exotic dancer while on shore leave with Kirk and McCoy on the planet of Argellius II. Other murders follow and each time, Scotty is the prime suspect. He seems to black out when each is committed and so cannot honestly deny at least the possibility that he's responsible. Ultimately, with the help of the ship's computer, it is discovered Jack the Ripper no less is the murderer... or rather, an alien force who has masqueraded as that famous killer and others down through the centuries. There are a number of nice touches in 'Wolf in the Fold,' including a scary séance that would be right at home in an old haunted house movie. A well-written change of pace for 'Star Trek,' 'Wolf in the Fold' holds up well on repeated viewings.",8
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Wolf in the Fold (TV Episode 1967)",Really dumb but also really cool!!,"Okay, I am quick to admit that the idea of the crew seeking out and trying to destroy Jack the Ripper is really dumb. Sure, the entire plot is just plain stupid. It seems in this episode that although people THINK Scotty has murdered a woman, it was actually ""Redjac""--a mass-murder who targets women. In fact, this killer has apparently moved on from planet to planet doing his evil deeds and was known by many names--such as ""Jack the Ripper"". How do we know? Well, a séance told us so, so it MUST be true! Later, they find that one of the chief government officials pushing for Scotty's conviction is none other than Redjac! It seems that it can occupy bodies and so when confronted, it moved about--bouncing from body to body until it was ultimately beamed into space by the transporter.So why, despite this dopey plot is it still worth seeing? Well, this is an unintentionally funny episode and just makes me and my brother laugh--especially since the guy who is inhabited by Redjac for most of the show is John Fiedler--the guy who was the voice of Piglet from Winnie the Pooh and the perennial patient of Dr. Bob Hartley on the old Bob Newhart Show (the cute bald guy). Seeing this meek little guy as a blood-thirsty maniac is just hilarious--especially when he is shot full of drugs and he drunkly cries out ""death,...death to you all,..."" as he's laughing!! It's really a hoot. Plus, the idea of Jack the Ripper is pretty cool--just not very believable. This episode is of all the Star Trek episodes, my ""guilty pleasure"".",8

6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Wolf in the Fold (TV Episode 1967)","""There's nothing like a walk in the fog with a bonny lass"".","I found this episode, as Spock would say - 'Fascinating' - for a couple of different reasons. For starters, Captain Kirk managed to come up with the name of the gaseous creature that appeared in the prior episode back in the second season. It was called the melittus and I found it odd that the entity would have a name here and not in the show in which it first made an appearance. That would have been episode #2.13 - 'Obsession'. Of course that can be easily explained away by the time bending properties of star date chronology, so I'll leave it at that.Now the other thing I have trouble wrapping my head around is the way Kirk and crew disposed of the entity. A super wide dispersal pattern was used by the transporter beam to send the melittus' molecules out into space. But wait a minute - that was a REAL person they sent to his death out there! Unless I'm missing something, the melittus occupied the body of Hengist (John Fiedler); it wasn't a shape shifter. So basically, Kirk kills a guy for being in the wrong place at the wrong time!But the idea of a Jack the Ripper entity surviving the ages to wreak havoc across space and time was an intriguing one. In a way, this was a reworking of the concept used in another Trek story - ""Who Mourns for Adonais?"", in which it's surmised that the myths of ancient Greek gods had their origin in aliens who visited Earth in the past. Making those creative leaps of faith often results in some great science fiction. And say, who couldn't use one of those regressive memory checks every now and then?",7
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Wolf in the Fold (TV Episode 1967)",Scotty on trial,"After an accident caused by a female crew member, which we don't see, Scotty is injured and it is feared it might cause him to start disliking women. To counter this he is taken to the hedonistic planet Argelius II where he certainly doesn't appear to dislike the woman dancing in front of him. He invites her to go for a walk with him and soon we hear a scream; she has been brutally murdered and Scotty is holding the knife and has no recollection of what happened. Scotty is detained by Administrator Hengist. It is proposed that he should be empathically probed by Sybo, the wife of the Planet's prefect; Kirk agrees but also suggests that he is scanned with a psycho-tricorder to be operated by Lieutenant Karen Tracy. Things soon get even worse for Scotty when first Lt. Tracy then Sybo are killed in a way that points to Scotty. However just before she dies Sybo claims to have sensed an evil presence. Back on the Enterprise everybody who may have had a motive is questioned under analysis; the true killer is unveiled but still remains a threat.This is a surprisingly effective episode; I say surprising because I doubt many viewers will believe for a minute that Scotty won't be cleared but there is still an interesting mystery. The crime itself has a degree of everyday brutality about it; three women killed with a knife not some sci-fi weapon or a creature with strange powers. When we learn who is responsible that is where we get the sci-fi; an entity that may have been guilty of many infamous murders over the years; including possible the most famous serial killer Jack the Ripper. It was nice to see James Doohan taking centre stage as Scotty and there is also an enjoyable performance from the diminutive John Fiedler as Administrator Hengist. Overall a quality episode with a darker than normal tone.",8

While she questions she is killed and Scot lies, unconscious near the body. The prefect of the city and his wife offer to hold a kind of séance where his wife, who has some sort of clairvoyant gift is to get to the truth. Unfortunately, during the séance, the lights go out and the woman is standing, knife in the back, Scottie standing behind her, blood on his hands. Kirk knows that the ship's computer can determine guilt or innocence. The prefect goes along with it, bringing two witnesses and Hengist with him. One weird thing is that the prefect doesn't seem terribly upset about the death of his wife. Still he wants to get to the truth. It isn't long before some interesting data begins to appear. Mr. Hengist is quite combative through the whole thing. This is the third trial of one of the principle characters. This episode is entertaining and fun.

Much fun is had with an Enterprise crew happily stoned out of their minds on tranquilizers, though in any sane universe Captain Kirk would have been court-martialed for leaving a seriously impaired crew in control of phasers and photon torpedoes.Still, this episode has some of the best lines in all of Trek:Sulu (sober): This is the first time I've ever heard a malfunction threaten us.Sulu (stoned): Whoever he is, he sure talks gloomy!McCoy: You better be careful, you're gonna hurt somebody with that thing!And probably the best ""No sh*t, Spock!"" line of all time:Redjac (in computer): I shall feed, and this time I do not need a knife!

This Star Trek episode isn't real clear on exactly who or what is doing the killing. But in terms of creating an atmosphere of terror of the unknown it can't be beat.Our Star Fleet legal system comes into play with modern computer devices that have rendered perjury non-existent.

I can just visualize feminists, listening to the line about how women are far more scared and ease towards fear than men, steaming at the ears. Scotty takes a walk in the foggy streets of Argelius II with a dancer from a club, when a scream reaches the ears of Kirk and Bones as they walk to a particular ""den where the women are"" Finding the dancer dead, Kirk discovers Scotty in shock, holding the murder blade in his hand. When other murders to women happen near Scotty (an officer of the Enterprise, the sensitive who unearths the evil causing the killings), he falls under further suspicion. The Enterprise has tools which could truly get to the truth, but Kirk will need permission from the planet's prefect (Charles Macauley) and has to deal with the law officer prosecuting Scotty (Winnie the Pooh's own John Fiedler) with plenty of speculative zeal, always questioning the efforts of Kirk to find out if his engineer is guilty or not. The prefect's wife, during the séance, mentioned three names, one of which calls on Jack the Ripper! Then the episode really goes for a twist: could Jack the Ripper actually be human form subjected with a possessive evil force that moves from one planet to another, occupying bodies to violently stab women and feed from fear in order to survive?!?! Scotty's innocence should obviously never be in any doubt, but I sure didn't see the lifeform which moves from one body to another linked to Jack the Ripper coming! Robert Bloch, leave it to him to come up with such an outlandish but provocative development right out of left field. Seeing Fiedler play into the finale where Kirk must punch him out cold and flip him over (well, the stunt double for him, anyway) is hilarious. The form taking over the Enterprise controls, cackling and talking a big game of what it will do to the crew, hoping to scare them, is just plain surreal. The trial of Scotty (there have been instances where our heroes undergo questioning in judgment or potential crime that might cost them dearly) puts him front and center (for the most part), with the history of ""the Ripper"" from one planet to another, connecting specific times it went on murder sprees, is quite an ""out of left field"" wrinkle in the story. Unexpected, to be sure, and goes from a rather intense mystery to an all out comedy (unintentionally or not). Feeding a mathematical equation into the ship computers to confuse the lifeform, and then giving the crew hypos which ease them into joy without the influence of fear, the episode really goes the kitchen sink route.

After a good run on its first season, the second season has more expectations to fulfill and hopefully they will try to develop the character a bit more and focus on the relations between the crew members on the enterprise to blend in and communicate easily with the audience despite of just focusing on more mind-numb missions that sometimes feel like they are filling their time and work in.It's always interesting and entertaining to encounter lead multiple characters sit around a table while discussing a topic or solving or deducting a case which is delivered in a large amount and the rest of it works due to its newer format or structure of the plotline.",

But when a serious of grisly murders point to Scotty, it's up to Kirk and Spock to clear their chief engineer's name and find the real culprit. 
Season 2 has this weird trend of revising Earth history and mythology which I find interesting. The Greek gods are now aliens and apparently Jack the Ripper is now an immortal being which feeds off of fear and bloodshed! What a strange concept for an episode. It's a bit too out there for me but the performances in this one are at least good enough to keep your attention occupied. John Fiedler is wonderful in his bit role and plays the part of the good guy turned killer very well.A major issue I have comes from a weird throwaway line that's completely unnecessary. It's something about how the being attacks women because they tend to frighten more easily or some BS like that. For a show as progressive as TOS, it's always unfortunate when something like that pops up. This is definitely a forgettable episode. This was written by the same man as the ""Catspaw"" episode, two of my least favorite thus far in season 2, a foray into the ""whodunnit"" genre that will leave your memory as quickly as it enters.",5

0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Trouble with Tribbles (TV Episode 1967)",Tribbles and Klingons - a Match Made in Trek Heaven,"This is perhaps the most famous episode of the original Trek series and with good reason - it's also the most entertaining. I consider this part of an elite triad of superlative Trek episodes, along with ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" and ""Mirror,Mirror."" The first, ""City...,"" is the serious one, even grim, with the time travel angle which became such a staple in all the Trek series. ""Mirror..."" represents the fantastic journey to other dimensions, beyond merely space travel or time travel, an ultimate adventure. And ""Tribbles"" is the comedy. There weren't too many intentionally amusing episodes of the original series, less than a handful. This one knocked it out of the park.It's well known now for introducing Tribbles to our culture - that and their unexpected ability to bring out the worst in Klingons, the best-known alien species in Trek. The fuzzy things spawned a cottage industry within Trek: writer Gerrold published a book devoted just to this episode; there was a sequel in the animated series in '73; and, most impressively, a sly remake/follow-up ""Trials and Tribble-ations"" during the Deep Space Nine series, very clever and almost as entertaining (no surprise it's my favorite DS9 episode). But, it's not the Tribbles which make this original episode so amusing. Rather, it's the canny take on some previously established lore involving future bureaucracy in the Federation and private missions of starship captains. We've all seen Kirk go off on his personal vendettas before and also being lectured by admirals to follow orders. Here, the mundane, the banal, is thrust upon him: instead of being allowed to explore the galaxy in the grandest tradition, he's forced to guard a bunch of wheat.It's a farce, Trek style. I could see Nimoy(Spock), usually standing slightly behind Kirk, struggling to contain himself in the face of Kirk's predicament throughout this episode. All of a sudden, these two are the Abbott & Costello of Starfleet and, boy, do I laugh a lot during those A&C movies. The tempo, the pacing and the timing in this episode is brilliant, just flawless, with the actors all rising to the occasion. When you think it can't get better, the script throws in a literal acknowledgment of Roddenberry's original concept - a 'Wagon Train to the stars' - the bar fight or the saloon brawl. The scene of Scotty & Chekov enduring Klingon insults and finally reaching that breaking point is some kind of glorious epitome in striving for first class Trek entertainment.",10
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Trouble with Tribbles (TV Episode 1967)","Sure it's a bit overrated, but it's still very good","While I certainly can't agree with ""gary olszewski"" who insists that this is the ""worst episode"", I do agree that it is a tad overrated. Yes, I do like it a lot, but I have talked to quite a few people who think it's the best episode. However, I might rank it in the top five--so I still liked it quite a bit because it was a good chance to do some self-parody. I really enjoy the few episodes where the show took a break from being deadly serious and just had fun--such as this one and I, MUDD and A PIECE OF THE ACTION. So, when I'm in a non-sophisticated mood, this episode is a good choice.Kirk rushes to a star-base because the Enterprise received a message that it was a dire emergency. However, when they arrived, the base looked just fine--no evidence of an attack or an emergency. Incensed, Kirk beams down to find out what's happening. To his consternation, he finds that the ""emergency"" concerns a grain shipment that is intended for ""Sherman's Planet"" (who Sherman is, we don't know--maybe he's the one from the Mr. Peabody Show). Despite the abuse of the emergency call, Kirk is reluctantly forced to post guards and be responsible for the grain.Since this is a star-base, the crew is given shore leave. However, Klingons are there as well for shore leave as a result of a recent treaty (the Organian one from a previous episode). And, naturally, due to the animosity between them, fights break out and the Klingons work on sabotaging the grain. At the same time, although it seems perfectly harmless, Uhura brings a cute pet back to the ship (a ""tribble""). There, it multiplies like crazy and soon the ship is overwhelmed with a plague of tribbles--and so is the space station. But, this turns out to be a mixed blessing and leads to a creative solution to the plague--thanks to Scotty.The episode is pure ""tongue-in-cheek"" and never takes itself seriously. The jokes and silliness come in rapid fire and you can't help but laugh at all the hooey. A must for fans of the series.",9
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Trouble with Tribbles (TV Episode 1967)","Consistently enjoyable episode that has a good story, great sense of humour and nobody taking it seriously even once","The Enterprise respond with all speed to a priority 1 distress call on a space station but Kirk is far from impressed when he learns that the call was signalled by Undersecretary for Agriculture Baris to guard some storage compartments of a new wheat hybrid. Reluctantly, Kirk agrees but only assigns two guards, giving his other available staff shore leave on the station. The importance of the grain is brought home to him though when Starfleet command him into action and the Klingons turn up on the station for ""shore leave"". With all these pressures on him, peddler Cyrano Jones selling a strangely enchanting creature called a Tribble doesn't even show up on his radar.I rarely review specific episodes of TV series but for Star Trek I thought I would locate this specific episode and watch it with a critical eye because this tends to be the one that most casual Trek viewers quote as their favourite. Watching it again I can understand why because it is a fine example of the gentle humour that makes the majority of casual viewers enjoy the series. So while we may not always like the clunking moral messages and so on, the humour is what makes it an enduring piece of entertainment. With ""Tribbles"" the whole story has been written with his humour running deep throughout it and everyone has their tongues in their cheeks throughout with a narrative that is wonderfully silly and fun.The cast mostly react really well to this lack of action and drama. Shatner wears a great air of weary disbelief about everything and he has plenty of great lines  particularly when mocking Schallert's Baris. He is not a great actor but he shows a real comic touch here and I was rolling with laughter as he stands up to his chest in Tribbles being pelted from above by them while delivering his lines. Nimoy enjoys himself too with lots of ""raised eyebrow"" moments while Kelley, Nichols, Doohan and Koenig all get good material. Adams hams it up but within the context of this episode it works really well.A fantastic episode then. It does depend on how you view Star Trek as a franchise because I'm sure many will see this silly episode as a low point but for me personally it is tremendous fun, had me regularly laughing out loud and left me feeling like I had been really entertained.",

I guess it's the same guy who put the 'bop in the bop-she-bop', because this episode is done with sheer fun in mind, never taking things too seriously, and offering different takes on the personalities of the main Star Trek characters. For sure, Captain Kirk is totally befuddled by this intrusion into his command (""Does everybody know about this wheat but me""?), and totally vanquished by Scotty's honesty, to the point of rewarding him with confinement to quarters! Just fine with Scotty - more time for those exhilarating technical journals.I can only think of one thing that might have made this one more hilarious, and that would have been to bring back Mudd. As it was, William Campbell does return in another guest spot as a bearded Klingon, last seen as Trelane, the Squire of Gothos back in the first season. Maybe Cyrano Jones (Stanley Adams) should have been given more screen time, what with his being a licensed asteroid locator and all. But we do get to see a Trek version of a barroom brawl, one more diversion from the regular course of duty aboard a Federation starship.This isn't one of my favorite episodes, but I can't begrudge anyone who holds it in their top ten. It's a lot of fun, and a nice departure from battling space aliens and trying to figure out how those time warp stories work. Also a neat jumping on point for new viewers who might not know anything about Star Trek and are on the fence about joining the club.",8

It's also shows the rich Star Trek universe, with space stations, political characters, space traders, alien enemies, and unusual and desirable (to a point) space creatures. The tribbles themselves are an interesting alien life form, at first glance bewildering to Dr. McCoy, of little practical use to Mr. Spock, threatening to the Klingons, and with an inexplicable life cycle. The episode looks forward to the future of the subsequent series (TNG/DS9/Voyager) in emphasizing political influence and intrigue over the typical episodic phaser displays and bravado, the bar fight excepted. As such it became a great foil for DS9's time-traveling return to K7, and to a lesser degree the animated series' ""More Trouble with Tribbles.""

An itinerant trader played by Stanley Adams is also there and among the items for sale are a specifies of peaceful little furry creatures called Tribbles.The one that Nichelle Nichols buys however starts to multiply, and MULTIPLY. Seems that Tribbles make rabbits behave like Trappist Monks. Pretty soon the Enterprise is overrun with them as well as the space station. But curiously enough they prove to be invaluable at uncovering a dastardly Klingon plot. Seems as though they're allergic to Klingons and that raises them up somewhat in the eyes of James T.

Meanwhile, on the planet, a man named Cyrano Jones, a traveling merchant, peddling junk, begins to distribute a little purring animal called a Tribble. They make people feel happy at their touch. They are soft and pretty. They are also perpetually pregnant and soon every nook and cranny is filled with Tribbles. The other side of the issue is that they are voracious eaters. It isn't long before the storage bins are compromised and the grain in the bins is replaced with Tribbles. There are some great scenes between the Enterprise crew and the Klingons, who have been sharing space with Kirk's crew. There is justice eventually, but not before a series of delightful events.",9

In fact, for all intents and purposes, it's a flat-out comedy. Without any effort to inject a sense of drama, it winks its way through a breezy 50 minutes and gives its players a nice, if furry, section of turf to stand on. While the star of the episode is clearly Shatner (never more charming as Kirk than he is here), I really enjoyed seeing members of the ""secondary"" cast each get their moments to shine.

It surprisingly worked and this episode to me is one of the best examples of showing that comedy and sci-fi can make a beautiful combo.In a way the episode plays out almost (and I mean almost) like one of those animal attack horror films like ""The Birds"" and others where it was about ordinary people dealing with creatures of nature turned against them. Though here this is the enterprise crew dealing with animal like creatures only their harmless, which I like because it's a turn on cliché.I really love the tribles, there are just so cute as there simply gentle soft fur balls. However they are problematic as we see they multiply faster than rabbits. The visual humor is just really funny as we see how they are just practically all over the enterprise everywhere you turn.Though to me what adds to the humor and actually makes it effective is Kirk himself. It's just funny seeing how much grief he is receiving from these cute guys, he is trying to maintain and establish order, while the Tribbles unintentionally create chaos (well sort of). From seeing them eat Kirk's lunch, but of course my favorite when Kirk opens up one of the compartments and well lets just say Kirk doesn't exactly hit the jackpot.And of course there is the brawl scene which I found both funny and exciting. It's just funny as we see some Klingon whom is both drunk and acting like an ass at first spewing insults about Kirk. Checkov we see is close to blowing his fuse but Scotty tries to maintain order that is until the Klingon pushes a wrong button with Scotty. After what the Klingon said about the Enterprise I thought, ""Oooooo, he's gonna get it now."" and surely he does.The chirography in it was solid, even one funny moment in the fight was seeing Checkov punch a Klingon in the midsection multiple times but with no damage, I thought ""Oh s..."" and of course you can guess what comes next for Checkov. Though what adds to the brawl is that the salesman character he is practically steeling drinks from the bar and smoothly walking past the fight.For the tribbles as an old saying goes, the more the merrier.Rating: 4 stars",10

This second season episode finds Captain Kirk and the crew of the USS Enterprise summoned to Deep Space Station K-7 after they receive a Priority One emergency distress call from Mr. Lurry (Whit Bissell) to ostensibly guard a silo of grain bound for Sherman's Planet. Initially, Kirk (William Shatner) assumes that Klingons have attacked the station. Imagine his surprise when he learns that nothing of the sort has occurred. Kirk has little sympathy for the plight of Nilz Baris (William Schallert) who authorized Lurry to issue the emergency call. Baris has just arrived from Earth to supervise the development of Sherman's Planet. Baris' assistant Arne Darvin explains to Kirk that Baris is the Federation Undersecretary in charge of agricultural affairs in that quadrant of space. Baris fears for the safety of his grain and demands that Kirk post all available security guards around the storage compartments. Naturally, Kirk doesn't share Baris' paranoia about the safety of all storage compartments containing quadrotriticale. According to the informative Mr. Spock, quadrotriticale is a high-yield grain, a four-lobed hybrid of wheat and rye. Mr. Lurry chimes in to point out that quadrotriticale is the only Earth grain that will grow on Sherman's Planet. Baris wants to ensure that the grain is safely delivered to Sherman's Planet. Baris fears that Klingon agents may try to sabotage it. Baris is livid with indignation when he hears that Kirk has agreed to station ""a mere two men for a project of this importance."" Kirk tells Baris that he has never questioned the orders or the intelligence of any representative of the Federation, but he does at this juncture. Kirk is surprised when Starfleet Admiral Fitzpatrick orders him to take whatever precautions are necessary. While on shore leave, the Enterprise crew meet Cyrano Jones (Stanley Adams of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's""), and he interests Uhura in a tribble, a warm, fuzzy critter that purrs like a cat. The only problem is that these tribbles reproduce like rabbits and soon they overrun the Enterprise. Worst, they get into the grain at the space station, but mysteriously enough die. Of course, Nilz Baris is incensed by Kirk's gross dereliction of duty as does his sinister looking assistant. Adding to these woes are the Klingons themselves who show up on shore leave. Captain Koloth (William Campbell) checks with Kirk to see if it is okay and Kirk agrees. Predictably, it doesn't take long for the Klingons and Kirk's crew to tangle in a free-for-all fight. As it turns out, Scotty started the brawl because a Klingon called the Enterprise a garbage scowl. ""Star Trek"" writer David Gerrold scripted an episode that bears a great deal of resemblance to a 1952 science fiction novel by Robert A. Heinlein entitled ""The Rolling Stones."" In the Heinlein novel, twin teenagers named Castor and Pollux, who live on the Moon, have rebuilt a space ship and gone to Mars to sell bicycles. They find what is called a ""flat cat."" These flat cats are born pregnant, and they repopulate their ship. Interestingly, Heinlein raised no objections to Gerrold's episode. According to Gerrold, all Heinlein wanted was an autographed copy of Gerrold's script.Altogether, this is an entertaining episode and a departure from all things serious. Ironically, Baris was correct to fear the threat that the Klingons posed to his project. The big surprise is the revelation about identity of the Klingon agent aboard Deep Space Station K-7.",10
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Trouble with Tribbles (TV Episode 1967)","not the best, but entertaining (and corrections)","As a Trekspert and long-time TOS fan, I can't say this is my favourite episode, but since it was written for comic relief, while still tweaking the eternal bureaucratic pinhead mentality that persists into this century and beyond, it was extremely entertaining. Most reviewers get this. Gary does not. Trek writing is actually quite decent, if only because it still holds up in 90% of episodes after 40 years. And this episode is intentionally funny, if a bit slapstick, making it a nice diversion from the usual serious plots of TOS. {To correct tsf1962: It is not the first episode to introduce Chekov. (Whose name you misspelled.) There are two correct answers to that question depending on whether you go by air date or production date (hint: In Catspaw, Chekov defends himself saying ""I'm not that green""). There is no consensus as to the most popular TOS Klingon but I will wager many votes will go to Canada's own John Colicos as Kor, menacing and threatening yet utterly fascinating to watch (""Errand of Mercy""). And who is Stephen Dorn? The character of Worf was played by MICHAEL Dorn. Comparing tribbles to rats is unfair and inaccurate; although people keep rats as pets, the tribbles were disruptive but not dirty or disease-ridden. I can forgive the misspelling of Lurry's name, but actor William SCHALLERT's name is listed in the credits. And it's Nilz BARIS, not Barrett (no relation to Majel). You got Nichelle Nichols' first name (difficult to spell) right but inexplicably botched her last name??? And as for Chekov's Beatles haircut, again, please try to watch the episodes in order before asking these kinds of questions. The Klingons were ""explained"" (very poorly) in Enterprise as to how they accidentally lost their foreheads.} Overall, a very enjoyable episode, with some delightfully cringe-worthy moments.",8

The fiendishly inventive script deals with issues ranging from bureaucratic mismanagement to environmental contamination to Cold War rivalries. The Tribbles are evidently the deep-space equivalents of rabbits, though in some ways they're more like rats; their rapid proliferation underscores the dangers of introducing nonnative wildlife to an ecosystem. Still, they're so cute and fuzzy we forgive them. ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" benefits from superb ensemble acting and a gifted guest cast: besides the aforementioned William Campbell there's Stanley Adams as galactic ""entrepreneur"" Cyrano Jones; Whit Bissell as hard-pressed station administrator Mr. Lurie; and William Shallert as Neils Barrett, the embodiment of the snotty, arrogant bureaucrat. Among the regulars, Nichelle Nicole as Uhura and James Doohan as Scotty give strong performances; this is one time the Enterprise crew functioned like a team instead of mere background players for the Big Three. Two questions, though: what's with Chekhov's Beatles haircut (clearly non-regulation) and why do the Klingons in this episode look more Caucasian than usual? It's hard to imagine how this bunch of loud but essentially harmless Galactic outlaw bikers could have evolved into the bulbous-foreheaded, alien-looking Klingons of ""The Next Generation."" One theory is that the later Klingons were full-blood Klingons; the ones on the original series were a Klingon-Vulcan hybrid.",10

The silly little creatures, the barroom brawl, the humorous dialogue... Many people love this episode but I'm not one of them. I've never been a huge fan of the outright silly Star Trek episodes.

This time a Klingon warship orbits a space station containing grain important to both sides, agriculturally relevant on a planet which compatible soil. Shore leave gives plenty reason for a bar fight between Klingon and Federation officers. And the tribbles - furry, soft, purring reproductive creatures – are introduced to Uhura by a trader, buying and selling merchandise from one sector to another (Stanley Adams, known as Tybo, the giant carrot on the infamous Lost in Space episode, ""The Great Vegetable Rebellion"") looking to turn a buck or two on the station.Charlie Brill (of Silk Stalkings) is Arne Darvin, assistant to William Schallert, whose grain of interest economically is awaiting arrival to Sherman's Planet (a disputed planet desired by both the Federation and the Klingon Empire), with Whit Bissel in charge of the space station which has become (much like the Enterprise) engulfed in breeding tribbles. William Campbell (Squire of Gothos) has a less significant role as the Klingon commander, Koloth, with Michael Pataki as his second in command, Korax. Korax is the one who insults Scotty's ship which initiates the memorable barfight. Sherman's Planet is the location where the grain goes to grow crops, with a diplomatic incident potentially threatening to the Federation's interests while the Klingons obviously wish to cause a disaster affording them access to the planet themselves. A Klingon agent is loose on the station, the tribbles and poisoned grain factor perhaps in his undoing. The tribbles disliking Klingons turns out to be a help to Kirk although their breeding is certainly a hindrance.The agriculture dispute and Klingon conflict with the Federation are an outline for tribble comedy. Kirk's headaches with Klingons and Schallert's constantly complaining agriculture officer should be enough, but his ship being enveloped by tribbles makes matters even worse. Tribbles spilling out of a grain containment bin and on top of Kirk, with Shatner emerging from a pile of them embarrassed and flummoxed is one of the series' enduring moments. A very popular episode, ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" has remained a classic among Star Trek fans. It is also a pop culture darling, recognized by even those who aren't Trekkies. Deep Space Nine had a brilliant follow up to this episode celebrating the 30th anniversary. What Scotty does with the tribbles, via transport, to get them off the Enterprise (Kirk had actually sat in his Bridge command chair on one!) is fitting and ironicthey couldn't have found a better home! Adams' trader left to gather up the tribbles off the station is also plenty of proper punishment for his own contribution to Kirk's woes. A light-hearted romp, this has nary an intense moment to be had, but this episode is all the same wonderful. And it has one of the best supporting casts of B-vets you could ever ask for. When even Kirk's soup and coffee are intruded upon by the tribbles, the captain has had enough...Spock and McCoy debating tribbles and love for cute animals included makes for such good times.",10
18,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Trouble with Tribbles (TV Episode 1967)",The classic comedy Trek episode,"This classic episode sees the Enterprise responding to distress call from Space Station K-7; when they arrive they are surprised to find no sign of trouble and Kirk is furious when he learns to distress call was put out by Under-secretary of Agriculture Nilz Baris who wants a consignment of grain to be protected! K-7 is near Sherman's Planet; a planet that s claimed by both the Federation and the Klingons and the side which demonstrates they have the greater ability to develop it will be given it; the special grain is an essential part of that development. Once ordered to support Baris, Kirk allows his crew to take some shore leave; while there Uhuru acquires a cute little creature called a Tribble; its purring seems soothing to humans. It isn't long before it becomes apparent that the Tribble may be trouble; soon there are more of the creatures and it appears that they are born pregnant! Before anybody can start worrying about the Tribbles another possible problem arises; a Klingon ship arrives asking for its crew to be given some shore leave it is only a matter of time till the two crews come into conflict.Often comedy episodes are a bit disappointing but this one is one of the best. We have some great guest characters, including William Schallert, as the officious Baris, and Stanley Adams and Cyrano Jones, as the seller of the Tribbles. Both very different but also funny characters. It isn't just the guest stars providing laughs; Chekov's claims that just about everything was invented in Russia were amusing and Scotty's explanation of how he started a fight after the Klingons insulted the Enterprise was priceless. The Tribbles are interesting creatures despite just being purring fluff-balls and ultimately serve vital to exposing a Klingon plot. If you are a fan of Star Trek this is one of those episodes you have to see, and if you enjoy it you'll want to watch the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode 'Trials and Tribble-ations' which uses some impressive effects to revisit the events of this episode.",9

It usually deals with important social or philosophical issues, causing one to think, ponder and contemplate.These space heroes do have a sense of humor, but it is not of the slapstick or pratfall variety. Perhaps a wry grin is merited at times, but no guffaws. There is too much important work aboard the ship to play around. It's only a five year mission to seek out new life after all, it's a big universe and time is a wastin'. For these reasons, this episode seems silly and inappropriate. Nor did I find it entertaining.It seems incongruous, a spoof or a parody of itself.The Klingons are brought in for no apparent reason, Mr Checkov, as usual, relates everything to his native country in an odd manner not suitable to the 23rd century, and the entire episode is just boring.

The dialog is lame, the acting pedestrian, and the story itself lends nothing at all to the credence of ST, but unfortunately, does giver to the stereotype the show's detractors will point to. The tribble problem aboard the ship is but a vehicle meant to get in the way of Kirk's job of putting out all the ""little fires"" engulfing them, the Attack by the Klingons, for one, and Nilz Barris continually, acting the self-important bureaucrat, getting in the way. There's nothing humorous or funny about it, it's boring, almost painful to watch, and keep in mind that this is Star Trek! BUT: There IS one saving scene that makes it memorable: The confrontation between Barris & Kirk, where Barris tells him ""I don't think you take this mission seriously"", and Kirk responds with ""The mission I take seriously, it's YOU I take lightly, now get out of my way, or I'll have you locked up!""

'The Trouble with Tribbles' is mild farce, running Kirk ragged between testy administrators, hell-raising Klingons and furballs with rabbit-like libidos.

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. After a good run on its first season, the second season has more expectations to fulfill and hopefully they will try to develop the character a bit more and focus on the relations between the crew members on the enterprise to blend in and communicate easily with the audience despite of just focusing on more mind-numb missions that sometimes feel like they are filling their time and work in.The structure of the episode is strong, efficient and different than any other which makes it unpredictable and intriguing that allows the audience root for it as it increases the curiosity and the stakes that are placed on the table in The Trouble With Tribbles.",
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Gamesters of Triskelion (TV Episode 1968)",Your Out a Your Vulcan Mind Spock!,"Memorable in a cheesy way for Star Trek TOS, this is a weaker season two episode. This episode has many memorable scenes which still make it must see Trek. Several things from this episode are used in bits in others shows like the voice clip of McCoy saying... ""Your outta your Vulcan mind, Spock!"", an obvious joke and a very good one in the play with the word substitution using Vulcan. This episode also had a clip that was very amusing with Kirk and his ""love interest"" the green haired alien ""female"" in a kiss with the aliens cameltoe very visible, this was used in a Star Trek bloopers video I saw with the Mission Impossible theme playing in the background as the tape was spooled back and forth, very funny! As far as that blooper scene goes, I don't see it in the episode cut because they cropped the picture where as the blooper reel used uncut footage, but you can see cameltoe when Kirk lays her down after knocking her out, this blooper reel also had a scene with a man (african-american no doubt!) shoveling coal into the Enterprises engines to make it go! Chekov's ""mate"" is also a dubious female, a precursor to todays transsexual (although a real female actor, maybe her voice was dubbed with that of a male's) and Chekov definitely understood this as he was hit on by this alien, also very funny stuff. So yes, it's very cheesy and not one that would rank as best Trek, but very memorable to watch for these reasons. Interesting to note, there is a woman at the helm of the Enterprise substituting for the now gone Chekov, a science officer (yellow shirt though, I think) who assists Spock in finding the lost crew. I don't recall another woman being at the helm, I thought that was very unique. She comes across very professionally and I would have liked seeing her launch some photon torpedoes in later episodes, too bad it was not to be, but it further establishes that the Enterprise had many crewmen. 7 of 10, I'm jaded that I have watched this series so many times, but the first time I saw it as a pre teen it definitely was entertaining, and since it still is deserves a decently high rating.

I'm also a fan of the fighting shows, partially because they tend to be high on the cheese factor. The Gamesters of Triskelion is chock full of both of those elements, but my score is a couple points lower than it would otherwise be due mostly to the fact that the plot of this episode isn't particularly fresh.To an extent, writers Margaret Armen and Gene Roddenberry, along with director Gene Nelson were cruising along on autopilot. It's certainly an enjoyable autopilot, but it's not enough to garner a 10/10. Very Similar ideas can be found in earlier episodes including Bread and Circuses, Arena, Amok Time, I, Mudd, and The Cage/The Menagerie. Another slight problem is that some of the mechanics of extending the episode are fairly transparent, such as Kirk not fighting so well in the early segments.Kirk, Chekov and Uhura are abducted and diverted a few light years away while being beamed down to another planet. They become imprisoned in a ""culture"" that uses violent games for sport. Through this and developments further into the episode, Roddenberry and crew are able to explore issues such as slavery, totalitarianism, and ideas of evolutionary, cultural and intellectual superiority.But The Gamesters of Triskelion is a lot of fun for other reasons, including the fight choreography and the often-ridiculous aliens, including a Grand Poobah who looks something like Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey. This episode also has one of Kirk's more questionable love interests.",8
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Gamesters of Triskelion (TV Episode 1968)",Gladiatorial School for the Enterprise Crew,"It's time to set aside the philosophy and kick some behind with your weapon of choice; this is gladiatorial combat, boys and girls, 23rd century-style. Kirk and two key officers, Chekov & Uhura, are shanghaied from the good ship Enterprise while about to beam down and whisked a dozen light years away to a planet ruled by so-called Providers, disembodied prime brains whose only means of diversion is kidnapping various aliens for their amusement as space-age gladiators. This could have been a serious indictment of slavery, represented by those intense collars-of-obedience, but, despite Kirk's seething display of resentment as he finally rips his off near the end, this episode is best known for its cheese factor rather than any deep commentary on such a provocative issue. If anything, it reminded me of a typical, action-oriented episode of the ""Lost in Space"" TV show - cheesy and somewhat laughable. It's best remembered now for the outfitted gladiatrix Shahna, played by actress Pettyjohn, who went on to adult-film roles.There are a lot of different aliens on display in this one, with the usual limitations of the make-up FX back then; to get a truly distinctive alien in the sixties, they would cast a giant actor (Morton), for example, but Ruskin as Galt manages to be truly alien in a creepy, eerie fashion, sometimes seeming to glide along rather than just walk around. Overall, it's average escapist fare, with sometimes silly dialog, Shatner over-emoting (""You're Killiinnng Herrrr...!"") and not much thought put into such issues as what these all-powerful brains do with their version of money, quatloos (I assume, hearing their betting frenzies, it's their version of monopoly money), boiling down to a final combat where Kirk breaks all the rules and wins anyway. It's also typical of the episode that Kirk spends a lot of time seducing Shahna, his, uh, drill thrall, in almost touching scenes, but ends up clocking her. Despite the cheesy entertainment, for my quatloo, the best scene is on the Enterprise with Spock, McCoy and Scotty. There, Spock shows he's ready to be a full time commander when McCoy & Scotty try to team up against him.",7

We have intellect obsessed with competition. So much to the point of using other living creatures to gratify their blood lust for sport. Remind you of anyone or any society current or historical?Beyond that, there's not much more to talk about. We have enslavement, gladiatorial games, a sexy alien babe, a dark ominous master ""chief thrall"", and some action.It's an entertaining episode. Try not to over analyze this one because you'll just give yourself a headache. In the end Kirk pulls another rabbit out of his hat by using the gamesters of Triskelion's own psychology against them. And for all of their higher ""intellect"" (which proved not to be so high after all), they still succumb to basic instincts in the end.I guess you might say that the one regret is that Kirk never came back to visit Shauna again, but hey, it's Trek.A good hours entertainment.

4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Gamesters of Triskelion (TV Episode 1968)","A mixed bag--some of it really, really cool and some of it kind of dumb","When the episode begins, Kirk, Uhura and Chekov are being beamed by the Enterprise's transporter. However, instead of ""sparkling"", they disappear and are transported by a fantastic force well across the galaxy. The Enterprise looks for them but don't realize that the seemingly impossible has occurred and only later does Spock play a hunch and begin searching well beyond the transporter's range--to other star systems.In the meantime, the three find themselves on a bizarre little world where slaves fight--often to the death--for the delight of the unseen ""providers"". It seems the providers brought them here to be an addition to their gladiators and to improve the ""breeding stock"". For Chekov and Uhura, the idea of becoming breeders is nauseating--especially since the mates picked out for them are gross or violent. However, Kirk being a super-stud of galactic proportions, goes about in earnest wooing his strange-looking would-be wife (big surprise, huh?). To get the compliance of the three, the foreman of the compound (who looks so very, very cool with his bald head and cool clothes) uses his cool glowing eyes to cause pain when they don't comply. I am a school teacher and really would love to have this ability! Later, the Enterprise find the three but because the providers are so strong, there isn't much they can do. In fact, the providers plan on bringing the entire crew down to the planet to fight in the arena. However, this awful fate is averted when Kirk accidentally makes a wager that the gambling-loving providers can't resist. Naturally, Kirk wins (after all, he is the Kirk-meister) and all the slaves are freed.While only an average episode, one reason this stands out is due to the SIMPSONS TV show. In the episode where Homer and Barney try out to be on the space shuttle, one scene is a wonderful re-creation of a scene from THE GAMESTERS OF TRISKELION!!! However, the idiots who syndicated the show chopped out this wonderful scene!!! See it on DVD if you get a chance.",7
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Gamesters of Triskelion (TV Episode 1968)",Kiss... punch.,"TGOT is a legendary episode, if for many wrong reasons. (But is cheesiness that ""wrong""?) The plot is more-or-less idiotic and linear, being a mere excuse to have Kirk-Fu fight-scenes, which no doubt pleased the younger viewers and the NBC top echelon - both of which are/were at about the same level of mental development. While the aliens are silly, they aren't a match for the camp factor of the Mugatu (""A Private Little War""), or the pizza-monster in ""Devil In The Dark"" (that episode always made me hungry), nor is the dialogue anywhere near as unintentionally amusing as it is in ""The Galileo Seven"" or ""That Which Survives"". The sets look nice, though. Perhaps I'm a little miffed that Kirk's love-interest looks like Barry Manilow. Angelique Pettyjohn later did porn. Funny, that, because usually it goes the other way round: first porn and then legit acting stuff (which around 0.0001% of all porn stars succeed at).So what else happens? Not much... Uhura almost gets raped. (But really, she should be glad they didn't send Kloog to mate with her.) Chekhov has to deal with a woman with a man's voice, and Kirk gets to argue with three pieces of jelly (yellow, green and red) that impersonate advanced brains. The irony is that the conversation between Kirk and the brains reveals that the latter are probably just as underdeveloped as the gray matter of NBC executives, hence the whole premise of the intellectually superior adversaries falls into water. The three ""super brains"" get duped and patronized to by Kirk in a manner that is more reminiscent of Kirk talking to his own daughters. (Well... reminiscent to Shatner, of course. I assume he talked that way to them when they were as young as these jello brains.) There is also something of a first(?) in TV, when Kirk first kisses and then PUNCHES the porn Manilow. (Perhaps Captain Kirk learned this trick from she-android Andrea (""What Are Little Girl Made Of?""), from the way she kissed and then slapped Kirk...)Something tells me that this scene was very popular on a sub-conscious level since so many of us wouldn't have minded seeing that being done with the real Manilow.Plus, if you're a fan of Spock vs. McCoy (one-sided) bickering, there's plenty of that here. Nearly every scene on the bridge is McCoy bitching about something, and when he tires of it, taking a brief breather, Scotty jumps in to help him. That is what is known as ""creating conflict for the sake of it (the drama)"", because it makes no sense that two intelligent people such as Scotty and McCoy would be so adamantly against every logical decision Spock makes.Still, even an average ST episode is quite fun.If you want to read ""The Chapel Factor"" and other ""lost ST episodes"", contact me by e-mail.",

As we've seen in episodes past, (The Squire of Gothos, Who Mourns for Adonais?), members of the Enterprise crew are hijacked in order to provide amusement for their captors, this time as gladiators a few galaxies removed from their original orbit. It always amazes me how the show manages to push the envelope on the old needle in a haystack routine. This time Spock has to figure out that Kirk, Uhura and Chekov have been transported some number of light years away, and wouldn't you know it, he guesses right. Fascinating.And speaking of Spock, his association with humans has begun to show some contamination in this story - he expresses hope that the Captain and crew can be found. Not the sort of characteristic I would expect from a Vulcan conditioned to pure logic. Though he did acquit himself well against the ramblings of Scotty and McCoy.This just might be the episode that cinched Captain Kirk's reputation as the Romeo of outer space, as he actually put the move on the Thrall Shahna (Angelique Pettyjohn), she with the green pouffe hair. It was hard to decide whether she was good looking or not, but the Captain didn't seem to mind. Too bad she didn't crack a smile every now and then, it might have made a difference.I guess it was only a matter of time before one of the characters got to utter the line in my summary above.

They soon learn that they are to be trained as Thralls on the planet Triskelion. Thralls are gladiators trained to fight for whichever of the unseen 'Providers' buys them. Collars are placed around their necks and any infringement of the rules leads to severe pain. Each of them is given a trainer Thrall; in Kirk's case Shahna; a green-haired beauty in a silver bikini! After impressing the Providers the trio are purchased and trained further. Meanwhile back on the Enterprise they are searching for the missing trio; there is no sign of them in the local area so Spock orders the ship to follow an anomalous reading. When the Enterprise arrives at Triskelion it loses power and the providers threaten to destroy it; Kirk has a proposition though the providers like to wager and he suggests one that could see the end to these brutal games. The only problem is he will have to face three Thralls in a fight to the death!This episode doesn't have the deepest of plots; it could easily be summarised as 'Kirk, Chekov and Uhura are kidnapped and forced to train as gladiators while Spock and the Enterprise look for them'. That doesn't mean it isn't fun though. The fight scenes are entertaining and it was amusing to see Kirk flirting with his trainer. When we finally learn the true nature of the Providers it is laughable to say the least but somehow it suited this rather camp episode. There is more humour provided by Chekov's reaction to the formidable woman who clearly wants to do more than train him. The regulars do a decent job but the guest stars are a bit wooden.

Kirk, as always, goes where no man has gone before. Did he or didn't he? We'll know in 9 months! So Kirk wages that he can take 'em all on at once, and is outnumbered 3 to 1. Of course he wins.

The planet is full of captive races from across the galaxy broken down into 3 groups of thralls for the 3 providers. Obedience is forced by shock collars attached to each thrall. The three crew members must think up some way to escape. Meanwhile back on the Enterprise, Spock has taken over command and must locate the trio. Despite the wishes of Bones and Scott, Spock takes the Enterprise on a course following a strange beam of light from many light-years away.Eventually, the providers reveal themselves as three autonomous brains sitting in a glass case making bets on the gladiator games of their whimsy. Kirk uses their gambling addiction against them, betting on everyone's freedom against the captivity of the entire Enterprise crew. He takes on 3 thralls at once, beating them soundly and freeing all the slaves. The Enterprise heads off into space as the thralls contemplate their newfound freedom.It doesn't matter how many times Spock is right in a situation. McCoy's always going to be a jerk about it and denounce logic and so on and so forth. If Kirk and the gang didn't make it to the planet then obviously they're somewhere else. Bones doesn't seem to get this. He's a doctor, what does he know about commanding the Enterprise? (Can you tell he gets on my nerves sometimes?)Anyways, this episode fairly average by Star Trek standards. The fact that these ""providers"" are so evolved that they've shed their bodies is cool. You'd think that these ultra-intelligent beings would be full of compassion and wisdom instead of wasting their days making sports bets and killing other beings. How unfortunate.I wonder how long the thralls have been there? Shahna was born there so at least 30 years, but it could be centuries; a scary thought! Half of me wonders if the brains re-enslaved the thralls as soon as the Enterprise left. Hopefully Star Fleet cruises by from time to time to check out the planet's progress.A forgettable episode.

They aren't sexist, they like their women warriors too.So for new warriors when William Shatner, Nichelle Nichols, and Walter Koenig go on an away mission in the transporter they're snatched mid transport and dropped light years away on a barren planet where the Providers provide for the feeding and training and other creature comforts of their Thrals and then wager their bogus currency on who lives and dies.I guess the Thrals are above humanoids, but below Organians in the evolutionary stage. In any event Kirk appeals to their sporting instinct to get out of this predicament.Kirk is provided one shapely trainer in Angelique Pettyjohn.

Thankfully Captain Kirk figures a way out of it, with his bravado, along with his diplomacy and famous fighting skill. He kisses a pretty alien girl, Shauna, a few times as well along the way. Kirk overcomes the evil aliens, and forces them agree to release all their people from slavery, and teach them survival skills so they can be independent. There is a tearful pang at the end, when Kirk and the alien female Shauna must say good-bye.

Above ground, they use their power to conduct gladiatorial games, with ""punishment"" collars around the necks of Kirk, Uhura, and Chekov, forcing them to train for a combat to entertain the providers. Those already formidable combat warriors with collars around their necks are assigned to train them, with Kirk trying to devise an escape planbut how? Kirk's trainer, an obvious lovely (with green hair and silver, scantily clad costume), begins to submit to his romantic advances as he tells her of what freedom is all about where he comes from, instilling in her ideas she's never thought of. Meanwhile a slight ion trail encourages Spock's logic to follow it, believing that this is the means behind where Kirk, Uhura, and Chekov were taken. Bones and Scotty believe Spock should have sent away teams to the previous planet before following what they believe was a hunch. Those disagreements, and Kirk trying to get his officers off the planet Triskelion, make up the plot for this episode.Kirk having to outsmart three supposedly higher intelligent superior lifeforms is nothing new, and seeing him talk to three pulsating blogs in a dome is a bit cheesy. Kirk and Angelique Pettyjohn becoming smitten with each other is another expected development. Mickey Morton, as the ""Master Thrall"", looks like Ming, the Merciless, from Flash Gordon, doing the bidding of the providers with a cold-blooded presentation. As the collars dole out intense pain that brings our heroes to their knees, he looks on without a care in the world. Memorable scenes include a scary possible rape where Uhura fends off a ""selected mate"" as Kirk can do nothing, helpless in another cell, and Pettyjohn punished with the collar for telling Kirk about the providers. The mechanical bidding as Kirk, Uhura, and Chekov must listen in restraints, enslaved and expected to fight or die, is quite unsettling. Kirk pitted against three thralls (games combatants) with the Enterprise and his crew's lives at stake once again allows the captain to get all the glory. Seeing Spock and Bones go at it never gets old to me. This reminded me of the Lost in Space episode, ""The Deadly Games of Gamma Six"".Still good to see Chekov and Uhura getting to be a big part of the action, joining Kirk, instead of Spock and Bones this go-around.",6

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. After a good run on its first season, the second season has more expectations to fulfill and hopefully they will try to develop the character a bit more and focus on the relations between the crew members on the enterprise to blend in and communicate easily with the audience despite of just focusing on more mind-numb missions that sometimes feel like they are filling their time and work in.The Gamesters Of Triskelion spends most of its time on action sequences whose motivation is admirable but due to lack of execution it fails to create the anticipated impact whilst the rest of it is something one can do with, the mystery, the conversations and the good old drama.",
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Piece of the Action (TV Episode 1968)",More Realistic than you'd Think!,"A few months after I moved to Japan to teach English in the late 90's, I was starting to get a bizarre Star Trek Deja Vu. Rather than wearing Kimono and wooden clogs and all the traditional stuff they show in the guidebooks, everyone, EVERYONE, wore Western clothing that was all slightly offkilter. Western boots with high spiked heels, 10-inch platform shoes, died blonde or orange hair, T-shirts with English messages that made no sense, a predilection for uniforms, black business suits that belonged to morticians, ubiquitous high skirts and stockingless legs for women between 6 and 40, to name just a few examples. I was especially taken aback by the commonplace adoption of English words into Japanese that were used, pronounced and spelled wrong dozens of different ways. A friend of mine held out his hand in a light drizzle and said to me, ""Look, Penny Rain, like in the Beatle song."" Finally I said to myself, ""Now, this is a highly imitative Alien culture."" Then I thought, ""just like the Iotians in 'A Piece of the Action.'"" For the next ten years, I kept my sanity only by imagining myself in the Reality TV version of ""A Piece of the Action II."" I've often wondered if the author of this script-- was it D.C. Fontana?-- had visited Japan. But really, when Old Commodore Perry first landed in Japan in 1853, crew members reported finding blueprints of devices and weapons pilfered from the ships for sale in the local markets. It could easily have been blueprints of Federation-issued phasers. Talk about your highly imitative Alien cultures. I think the creators of this episode were right to make it a comedy-- it IS a comedy!-- and if the clowning around in pinstripe suits and tommy guns --I remember Fizzbin well!-- eclipses the core anthropological idea, so be it. Its still one of Star Trek's Classics, and it still makes me chuckle whenever I think of it.And remember, all Japan wants is a piece of OUR action.",9
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Piece of the Action (TV Episode 1968)",Some are Mafia Camp,"Star Trek is often very cheesy and/or campy. That's part of what I and many other fans love about it. But it's difficult to say how aware Gene Roddenberry and crew were of just how cheesy/campy it often was, because occasionally, they did a show, like A Piece of the Action, where they're clearly trying to be cheesy/campy, and on top of the strong dose that's ordinarily there, these shows become very over the top--and very fun. A Piece of the Action may not win the award for the campiest show of the lot, but it at least ties--no other episode could trump this one. Well, not unless it's holding three Queens on a Wednesday night in October when the moon is full.The Enterprise responds to a call from another ship 100 years after the fact, because the call was made from ""old fashioned"" radio. One hundred years ago, there was no Prime Directive (the Starfleet philosophy of putative non-interference with explored cultures), and the previous ship left a large tome behind--a study of the Mafia in Chicago in the 1920s. Unfortunately, the culture they left to deal with this alien text was highly adaptive and imitative. When the Enterprise crew happens upon them, they're in a near-anarchic state, ruled only by warring gang bosses.The idea of such a highly imitative culture is an extremely interesting one with a lot of clout philosophically and scientifically, which makes it surprising that it's not been explored more in science fiction. Here, in addition to weightier ideas, it also provides a perfect staging ground for a wacky episode of Star Trek where Kirk and Spock get to don flashy pin-stripe suits, tote around machine guns, and for the coup de grace--speak in ridiculous, affected gangster accents. It's particularly funny to see Spock try to fit the act, although not surprisingly, Leonard Nimoy doesn't ham it up as much as William Shatner does.The amusement doesn't end there. There's a running-down-the-hallway-in-and-out-of-closed-doors-styled cat and mouse game as Kirk, Spock and McCoy bounce back and forth from the Enterprise to the planet surface, and in and out of custody of two different gang bosses. Kirk, who is always amusing for off-the-cuff scheming, comes up with some doozies here, including a very funny card game. The make-it-up-as-you-go-along aesthetic permeates the episode, all the way to what's probably the most ridiculous jokey closing banter of the series.Although it has influences and precedents, including Star Trek itself--in the Season 1 episode, City on the Edge of Forever--and it has maybe influenced other, later works--I couldn't stop thinking of the computer game, Mafia, which I just finished playing a couple weeks ago, A Piece of the Action has a very enjoyable, unusual, tongue-in-cheek and slightly crazy approach to this material. Even if you don't watch every episode of the original series, make sure you see this one for a taste of comic relief.",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Piece of the Action (TV Episode 1968)",Da Federation gets a cut of Forty Percent,"OK, here we go...a hundred years ago (funny how it's almost always a clean century back?), a Federation ship, The Horizon, visited this planet and left behind a book about the Chicago mobs of the 1920's. This book is the contamination, as Spock terms it, a bible on which an entire civilization has based its culture on. See, these people are imitative. The concept could be scary, an unsettling reminder of how an entire society of people can be deluded into following a certain doctrine, whether it makes sense or not. Well, whatever turns a profit makes sense to most people. But, the Trek-makers decided to go the comedy route on this one. Most of the humor stems from all the catchy phrases that Kirk and his boys get inundated with during the course of the adventure. They get 'bagged' by Bela, the big boss, almost immediately; they break free, but Kirk is soon put 'on ice' by Krako, the second most powerful goon. Then Tepo gets a ride to Bela's flop while on the other end of his blower. Check? Right! The whole thing is ridiculous if you step back and look with a fairly objective eye but, by the 3rd act, we're so immersed in the escapades it doesn't matter. Here's Kirk's chance to play God once more, served up to him on a platter: the Federation itself is responsible for this culture getting out of whack years back, so Kirk, rubbing his hands together in anticipation, knows he has a great chance here, a duty really, to rectify matters. A rationalization? Maybe. But, so what? So soon we have 'Kirk-o' and 'Spock-o' dressed to the nines, toting their machine guns, re-organizing an entire culture - not in theory, but in practice; Kirk's a field commander, after all, not some deskbound pencil-pusher. He plays the game of the locals and, because he's Kirk, he plays it better. Speaking of playing games, his creation of the Fizz-bin card game is an instant classic, especially as I could swear that Shatner was ad-libbing the entire scene, changing the rules with each card played. My favorite scene, however, is with Scotty & Krako, their conversation about cement overshoes.",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Piece of the Action (TV Episode 1968)","Hilarious, Tongue-In-Cheek Episode","In what must be one of the funniest episodes of the series (and a great indicator of the series' intentional comedic possibilities -- brought to fruition in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home), the Enterprise crew visits a planet that has taken a historical text on 1920s Chicago gangs as its bible. As the residents of the planet are remarkably imitative in nature, the planet's residents have divided themselves into a series of criminal gangs, two of which are headed by Bela Oxmyx (Anthony Caruso) and Jojo Kracko (Vic Tayback), and Kirk and Spock find themselves in the middle.What makes this otherwise frivolous episode work is the fun Shatner and Nimoy have with the historical disconnect -- most notably in Kirk's efforts to drive a car (and Spock's reactions thereto) and his subsequent efforts to pick up the lingo of the planet. Needless to say, Shatner plays this for all it's worth, and Nimoy's gift for understatement complements it beautifully.Truly a joy to watch -- just don't spend too much time analyzing it.",7

It was hilarious to see Kirk talking like a gangster, then setting up a mob syndicate--to stop a spate of out of control gangland shootings--and negotiating the Federation's 40% 'cut' or share from the syndicate. Kirk later unconvincingly justifies to Spock that the money will be directed towards an ethical fund to guide the Iotians to a more normal existence...that is until he learns that Dr McCoy lost his tricked back on Sigma Iotia II which means the Iotians might demand a piece of the Federation's action in the future!Great comedy and hilarious acting throughout. Of course, Kirk is only sorting out the mess that the last Federation starship, the USS Horizon, created 100 years ago before the prime directive came into effect. The Horizon's crew left behind several publications including a book on Chicago Mobs in the 1920's which the intelligent Iotians quickly imitated. This was really Star Trek's last comedy episode since season three started with Fred Freiberger who was a 'serious' science fiction producer.

Guns are everywhere, and incessant warfare between rival gang bosses has brought their civilization to the brink of ruin. Kirk's solution is to take over the planet in the name of the Federation and force the rival gangs to work together. Anthony Caruso and Vic Tayback (Mel in ""Alice"") are quite convincing as mob capos, Caruso in particular resembling Don Vito Corleone in his manner and bearing. The set design and costumes are dead on for the period. Add William Shatner doing a bad Marlon Brando impression, and you find yourself wondering, ""How did they do that?""

The ship reported an intelligent, developing alien species prone to imitation. The Horizon left behind a tome about 1920's Chicago and the Mafia which became the Iotians sacred text. When the Enterprise arrives, it finds a planet ruled by mob bosses with machine guns and an old-timey gangster dialectic.After beaming down, Kirk, Spock, and Bones find themselves in the middle of a turf battle. Both sides take turns holding the three hostage and demanding the Federation's firepower in order to take control of the planet. Kirk must do his best to fix the wrongs of the Horizon without interfering too much with the development of the planet's evolution.Kirk's solution is to transport all the crime lords into one room and threaten them with the power of the Federation by stunning a city block's worth of cronies. That really whips everyone into shape. Kirk informs the bosses that the Federation is taking over and will be back on a yearly basis to take their cut. He creates a syndicate to make the planet a more peaceful place. As the Enterprise leaves orbit, Bones remembers that he left a communicator behind, jeopardizing the Prime Directive. This episode is so silly... but I kind of like it. The fact that they are able to figure out and recreate 1930's mafia culture by having just a book with some pictures is ridiculous but if you want to enjoy this episode, you have to play along.
Seeing Spock in an old gangster suit and hearing Kirk's impressions and lingo are both great comedic moments. I think a lot of TOS's comedy tends to fall flat with a modern eye but this episode is probably the most genuinely funny I've seen thus far.The crew getting mixed up in a planet's gang wars is such a weird idea for an episode. The Federation is concerned primarily with the galaxy at large, but in this episode we really get micro with it. I enjoy that.All the performances hold up.

While this planet uses a Chicago Mob book to model an entire society, today on Earth we are taking an entire generation of people and molding it into a society where everything is centered on Video Games and Computers. We even have a ""boss"" running the earth right now who very much resembles Bela Osnicks. With NBC pushing the budget lower & lower on this series, the result here is fantastic.

At first, Kirk, McCoy and Spock are at a loss at what to do when they are taken prisoner and threatened with death unless they provide one of the ""bosses"" with weapons so he can conquer the planet!!!

It is a good example of how good writers can take a situation that could be rather grim-think of ""Patterns of Force"", where there has been a major violation of The Prime Directive -OK, it wasn't in force at the time, but it was situations like this that led to its adoption-and make it funny and effective.

14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Piece of the Action (TV Episode 1968)",kind of funny,"I sometimes wonder whether William Shatner ever really 'got' Star Trek. As partial evidence, I submit his stated preference for 'A Piece of the Action'. He has said it's one of his favorite episodes, and generally prefers the work of Gene L. Coon over that of Gene Roddenberry. This suggests to me a basic misunderstanding of what 'Star Trek' was all about. 'A Piece of the Action' reminds me more of countless other '60s action/adventure/spoof/comedy TV shows, like 'The Wild Wild West.' In this episode, the science-fiction element is only the flimsiest of excuses for the Enterprise crew to clown around in a 1930's Chicago-like mob setting, wear gangster-style clothes and engage in a lot of stereotypical 'youse guys' dialogue and machine-gun shoot-em-ups. It could have been worse, I guess. There are some amusing moments. And to be fair, Roddenberry himself had a thing for setting ST stories in places that resembled the Roman Empire and Nazi Germany. In 'A Piece of the Action,' the Enterprise investigates a planet where the society is based on a book about Chicago's gang wars and mobsters that was left there by a previous Star Fleet vessel years ago. Kirk and company discover the only way to interact with the inhabitants is to act like gangsters themselves; they end up taking over the planet in order to bring a kind of peace to it. Some of the dialogue is funny, some is painful. The so-called 'prime directive' is ignored yet again; it wasn't a very good idea in the first place, as Kirk circumvents it almost any time they visit a new planet. After a while, you ask, what's the point? So back to Shatner saying he thought this was one of the best episodes. It's really not, and it's not one you would pick to show someone who knew nothing about 'Star Trek' as representative of what the series was all about.",5

And imagine the usually unflappable Spock being scared out of his wits by the ineptness of Captain Kirk's efforts to drive an old jalopy with a stick shift. Most of all---there's ""fizzbin"", and thereby hangs a tale. I remember an innovative psychiatrist of the last century, Dr.Milton H. Erickson, who pioneered some highly unusual and effective approaches to working with hypnosis---including what he called the ""confusion"" technique---and as I watched Captain Kirk's improvisation of the game of fizzbin I suddenly realized that he was using a version of this technique, which made the whole sequence even funnier!

This is harmless fun, to be fair. The cast look as though they are having a good time and that's one way to encourage the viewers to do the same.

The Enterprise has orders to investigate what is going on on Sigma Iotia II. 100 years earlier, the U.S.S. Horizon disappeared shortly after leaving the planet's area - reported missing. Bela Oxmyx, an Iotian mob boss, has contacted the Enterprise and promise to give them information about the Horizon. Kirk, Spock and McCoy beam down to quickly learn the inhabitants have patterned themselves after the 1920s Earth era. They are met by Bela's mob and they bring him to Bela. What Bela wants is ""heaters"" or phaser weapons so he can completely take over the everything. There are other mob bosses and gangs that want to take over as well. Kirk and crew must bring peace and a solution to the problem and Kirk comes up with an odd plan that works for all of them but leaves Spock questioning the future outcome.Neat, odd and fun episode... one of my favorites due to it's quirkiness.

Kirk, Spock, and McCoy do so, hoping to ""correct"" the ""pollution"" that ""corrupted"" the Iotians, but such lofty goals will be difficult. The plan is to get two rival factions (Vic Tayback and Anthony Caruso) who operate separate gangs on the planet to unite and be as one, ending non-stop violence between them. But both Tayback and Caruso want ""heaters"" (phasers) as superior weapons to gain control, with Kirk and Spock seemingly always duped into capture over and over. Can Kirk and company right the wrongs of an Earth ship who left them ""worse for wear"". The lingo, set design, tommy guns, cars, and costumes imitate those ""old Earth gangster movies"" exceptionally well. Kirk and Spock adapting accordingly makes this all the more entertaining. The dialogue is especially worthwhile, as Kirk really gets into the part, with Spock, bless his heart, also trying. Spock in his own language within such an environment is too much fun. I couldn't stop laughing every time poor Scotty tries to decipher the gangster speak, with Kirk having to go from the mob language to Federation speech across the communicator to help him out. The made up Kirk card game ""fizz bin"" to outsmart a gangster cracked me up to no end. How Spock and Bones beam down into a trap, while Kirk has to get out of a jam when it appears he's about to be ""put on ice"" continue to underlie just how complicated it can be untying the knots of past ""interference influence"". Kirk and company must somehow speak in the language now firmly engrained in the Iotians, adapt to the surroundings in order to strategize how to coordinate a coup that would bring all of the planet's inhabitants into one fold, and avoid being ""dusted"". You can clearly see that Shatner is having a grand ole time. A real hoot.Bones leaving behind a communicator, the Enterprise used to ""blanket stun"" gangsters, the transporter moving gangsters from one place to another, Kirk getting help from a youngster in return of what the kid believes will be a ""piece of the action"", and plenty of Vulcan neck pinches and Kirk punches to the kisser are just some of the funny bits.",10

Records show that the people of Sigma Iotia II are an intelligent but highly imitative race but nothing indicates the sort of society they discover when they beam down. Rather than finding a peaceful society they discover a world that could be prohibition era Chicago with tommy-gun wielding thugs carrying out hits for rival bosses. Kirk, Spock and McCoy find themselves captives of the most powerful boss who demands that they supply him with a hundred fancy Federation heaters (phasers)! Here they learn what happened to the Iotian society; when the Horizon crashed a number of books were found; many were just technical manuals but one was a history of Chicago in the Twenties and the Iotians used it as a template to build a new society!This is one of those episodes which could quite easily have turned out to be an embarrassing disaster but instead it is an amusing triumph. Seeing Kirk talking like a cliché gangster was priceless as was the reaction of a rather confused Scotty as he tried to understand him William Shatner was clearly enjoying himself in these scenes! Guest stars Anthony Caruso and Vic Tayback do fine jobs as the rival bosses, the delightfully named Bela Oxmyx and Jojo Krako, taking the roles just seriously enough to make this episode as good as it is. There are plenty of hilarious moments such as Kirk inventing the convoluted card game 'fizzbin' and later demonstrating that the ability to captain a starship doesn't qualify him to drive a car.

20,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Piece of the Action (TV Episode 1968)",Gangster World,"Culture can be a very strange thing indeed from not just difference in region but how each constantly changes from time to time, making even our own home seem like a whole different world. This is another comedy episode for the show, and one of my personal favorites if you believe that.I really like the concept which I think is interesting and kinda cool on an alien society that imitates any culture or sub culture perfectly. I can't help but think what would happen if it was the Wild West or even just a mere TV series like ""Game of Thrones"" or comic book series like ""Batman"" yeah that would be something. This society is clearly amoral from the hits and territorial wars that go on everyday, but to them it is a way of life. We see they've mistaken a history book on Gansters to be sort of their Bible or law book; which is understandable if your culture isn't familiar with history, law or religion. However these aliens aren't totally evil they do have a genuine goal which is to create a functional society the problem is their on the wrong track.I like certain little moments like seeing the gangster bosses Oxmix playing pool and Crackle throw a dart at a board incorrectly . It's suttlely funny but just shows how both truly are aliens despite all they built and achieved, their not perfect there is still a lot they haven't learned yet.But of course what really makes this episode is the comedy. I like how the characters react and their inexperience with the culture which makes sense; despite knowing the history of that era they've never lived in that era so certain customs and technology would be unfamiliar to them. This also in a way reminds us that even the Starfleet officers are also aliens to not just alien culture but their own as well.I really like seeing how confused Scotty and even Kirk for a while are with the gangster lingo. Even seeing Kirk start to use it when he gives a speech to all the bosses which I can't help but snicker to. Though my favorite moment was seeing Kirk trying to drive stick shift on a old 1920 car and both Kirk and Spock go to their destination very slowly; you could literally just walk past their car and get their ahead of them.This episode has enough fire power for laughs.",10
21,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Piece of the Action (TV Episode 1968)",Classic Star Trek,"Such an entertaining and thought provoking episode! Our three heroes beam down to a planet, where the culture (they soon figure out) is based on a book, written supposedly in 1992, about 1920's Chicago gang lifestyle.The book had been accidentally left behind by other explorers. We see the book, prominently displayed,ie the ""Bible"" of their society, which does look like a large coffee table history book, said to have been written in 1992. Rather eerie that this program was made in the 1960's. The very amusing thing in this episode is the 1920's gangster vocabulary and accent, which Captain Kirk picks up with amazing alacrity, and, as a result, he is able to take charge of the situation. Of course, the slang and the criminal swagger seem hysterical in the mouth of our beloved Captain. Kirk and Spock truly look great in their gangster threads. Although Kirk has much difficulty in driving a stick shift vehicle, alarming Mr Spock, he is able to invent a card game called"" Fizzbin"" on the fly to dazzle the rather dull witted gangster minions. By picking up on the lingo and the attitude of the culture, Kirk is ultimately able to negotiate an appropriate agreement that will further the best interests of the society, get back into his regular Captain duds and zoom off in his space ship. Love it.The moral of the story here concerns the book about the old-time Chicago gangs that happened to get left behind, and as a result, became the society's blueprint for their civilization. Beware of who you idealize? Beware of unintended consequences? Food for thought.",10
22,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Piece of the Action (TV Episode 1968)",I've Got A Grudge Against These Guys!,"I can't say this is the worst Star Trek episode, not when there's stuff around like ""The Squire of Gothos,"" ""Shore Leave,"" and ""I Mudd."" But it's really bad. And I have a grudge against it that's hard to define.STAR TREK was a show that dared to dream about the future . . . that dared to imagine an era when man overcame evil, greed, and corruption and set out to discover the galaxy in peace. Well, that's a wonderful vision, a wonderful achievement. But the drawback is that ""evil"" in these original episodes is either seen as a relic, or a joke. And that sometimes makes Star Trek itself seem shallow. Not often, but certainly this time around. And the irony is that the ""evil"" of the mob, of organized crime, proved to be a lot more resilient (at least in popular culture) than Star Trek ever suggested!When this movie aired, mob movies had become a joke, and quality mob shows had disappeared from television. Yet less than five years later, THE GODFATHER began an extraordinary Renaissance for mob drama, a Renaissance that has lasted right down to the present day. In retrospect, playing the mob ""for laughs"" was tone deaf because there was still a lot more to say about what crime has meant, can mean, and will mean, in America and the world.""Do I think that organized crime will pack it's bags and go the way of the Dodo?"" No, I don't. I think this episode plays for cheap laughs, where a show like THE SOPRANOS provides plenty of laughs and still asks universal and uncomfortable questions about the nature of evil. What I'd really like is to see a piece of full-length fan fiction where James T. Kirk goes head to head with Tony Soprano, not in some campy goof but in deadly seriousness.Because that's what fan fiction is for!",3

24,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Piece of the Action (TV Episode 1968)",but in all the confusion..,"Star TrekA Piece Of The ActionA cultural hub and by far one of the most loved and respected tale, Star Trek is created by Gene Roddenberry who wrote this brilliant concept, ahead of its time and is probably why it still doesn't fail to entertain us after these many years. It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. After a good run on its first season, the second season has more expectations to fulfill and hopefully they will try to develop the character a bit more and focus on the relations between the crew members on the enterprise to blend in and communicate easily with the audience despite of just focusing on more mind-numb missions that sometimes feel like they are filling their time and work in.Unlike any other episode, A Piece Of The Action doesn't spend its time on mindless action sequence but rather on offering concrete material and a hint of a politics in it but what it fails to achieve is hold the audience through it as it lacks a gripping screenplay.",
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Immunity Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)","Well-written, visually-striking, mind-blowing.","One of the best and most memorable episodes of the original Trek series.First off, the ""star"" of the show: the gigantic space-amoeba critter was such an impressive sight in the original series, that when it was re-released in the recent ""enhanced"" episodes with remastered HD format and state-of-the-art effects, the creature itself was left virtually unchanged. In fact, IMO, the critter looked better unenhanced.This is doubly impressive in light of the show's budget limitations, being a relatively inexpensive process put to very good effect.On top of that, the writing doesn't fall into the bogus-science 'treknology' gibberish and continuity problems that plagued and dragged so many episodes into mediocrity. The science in this episode is rock-solid, one of the few Trek episodes that qualifies as true hard-core science fiction.The story itself is slowish for Star Trek, more brooding than action, but it works without insulting your intelligence in the process.",10
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Immunity Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",A Fantastic Voyage,"The plot of this great episode, insofar as the antagonist goes, at least, is something of a combination of the then-contemporary Jules Vernish Sci-Fi film Fantastic Voyage (1966) and past Star Trek episodes of more exotic extraterrestrial life forms, such as Obsession, which immediately preceded The Immunity Syndrome if you follow the production rather than the broadcast order.That doesn't mean that this is a rip-off (not that I'd deduct points from it just for that fact alone, anyway), but just a very Trekkian way of doing an interesting idea. And at any rate, as with most Trek episodes, what really makes it work are the character dynamics (stemming from both the writing and the performances).Especially beginning in the second season, Star Trek writers (surely including creator Gene Roddenberry and under his guidance) had a lot of fun exploring a yin-yang dynamic between Spock and Dr. McCoy. Spock, as even many people who aren't Trek fans know, represents a ""cold"", logical way of looking at everything, although Trek fans know that he's much more complicated than that (providing a bit of his yin-yang opposite within himself), and it's not just because he's half-human--other Vulcans are more complicated than that, too. Whereas McCoy, emphasizing his ""I'm just a country doctor"" attitude, is often highly emotional--ready to fly off the handle at the drop of a deflector shield, and ready to make a sarcastic crack the moment he sees Spock, at least. The presence of his yin-yang opposite within himself can be more difficult to see, but surely it's in his vocation and vocational activities.The Immunity Syndrome is as good a place as any in the second season to watch that yin-yang tension and harmony between Spock and McCoy unfold, and it's brilliantly set up and justified here by both an event (the fate of the Vulcan ship) that immediately proceeds our main dilemma and the facts of the main dilemma as they are figured out.This episode also hits you in the face with a surprising side of Spock that was shown many times earlier, but usually in a way that seemed less contradictory--he basically has psychic abilities, to an extent where some humans around him are highly skeptical of the skill, and where it's obvious that at least as humans and Star Trek viewers understand the mechanisms at this point, the abilities aren't exactly logical.At any rate, for various reasons, this episode should keep you on the edge of your seat for much of its length. The antagonist, which at first cleverly seems something like a black hole, embodies a fascinating idea, and something that would be very dangerous if it could be true. There are gripping sacrifices being made, near impossible technical/technological difficulties to overcome, and the situation has everyone psychologically strained to a near breaking point.And there's something else worth watching out for in this episode, especially for those who like to point out some of the shows often-funny quirks on a meta-level, since it's one of the best examples of this--just why did Starfleet not have the foresight to install seatbelts or harnesses on its ships and shuttles? The Immunity Syndrome features many great scenes of actors flailing about, throwing themselves on the floor, and in one case, even doing an impressive flip (watch for a minor character in the background on the bridge towards the end of the episode) as the camera rocks back and forth to represent turbulence.",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Immunity Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)","""I recommend survival"".","I had an interesting thought as Spock described how he had a 'deep understanding' that allowed him to feel the death of four hundred Vulcans aboard the Intrepid to start the show. It reminded me of Obi Wan Kenobi experiencing a 'tremor in The Force' a decade later to kick start a new franchise that came to pit Trekkies against fan-boys. Personally, I enjoy both universes and would call it a toss up, though George Lucas had the advantage of an additional ten years in the way of technology.You know, for a while there I couldn't figure out what was wrong with Captain Kirk. With the zone of darkness getting stronger and the Enterprise getting weaker, Kirk is fishing for options. McCoy offers his survival recommendation, which is always a good one under the circumstances, but then the Captain remarks on the show's opening mission statement and goes for the gusto. Got to forge ahead and see what makes this giant space amoeba tick.This one offers some scintillating dialog between Spock and McCoy discussing the merits of Vulcan dignity, with each digesting food for thought as Spock gets the nod to man the shuttle-craft into the belly of the beast. It's always amazing to me how these danger episodes always brought the Enterprise right to the brink until the very last second, and it always turns out favorable. Of course there'd be no more show otherwise, but you know what I mean.I couldn't help chuckle while watching today as I thought back to the era and how TV played into the popular culture back then. That space amoeba could just as easily have been the backdrop for Steppenwolf or Iron Butterfly on the Smothers Brothers Show or any other popular variety format back in the day. At times I felt the psychedelic effects were either overkill or unnecessary to enjoy the music, but today it's just another one of those cool reminders of a decade gone by that enjoyed their own unique characteristics.",7
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Immunity Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",The Enterprise vs. a very Huge Cosmic Germ,"It's a cosmic threat to the galaxy which the Enterprise crew faces this time, an unusual invader, to say the least (see the previous season's ""Operation Annihilate!"" for another far-out invader). This episode gains a point or two for the almost mind-blowing observation, voiced by Kirk & McCoy, that mankind's sole destiny may be in repelling such invaders of our galaxy; our species may, in this theory, act like antibodies of the galaxy-body, fending off invading cosmic viruses. As the story begins, we're too late to save a solar system and one starship, manned by Vulcans, has also fallen victim to the invader, a one-celled organism about 11,000 miles long, surrounded by some black nega-field. Conceivably, were this creature to reproduce, as the crew discovers it is about to, it would eventually fill the entire galaxy. Pretty wild. The pace is a bit slow in this episode, sort of reflecting the lethargy the crew becomes afflicted with - the space creature drains energy, including the life functions of human beings.Much of the tension in the story stems from the rather strange competition developing between Spock and McCoy. Both seem a little too eager to be the one to pilot a shuttlecraft into the gelatinous mass of the creature and conduct analysis, even though this little mission is regarded as a one-way trip, a suicide mission. Kirk has to pick one of them for the trip and, though Spock accuses McCoy of having a martyr complex, they both hint to Kirk, 'pick me! pick me to die!' in the same fashion. This episode takes the often-volatile Spock-McCoy relationship to the next level, binding them together in an odd death wish syndrome. Whether they're both attempting to impress Kirk or seeking to discover new scientific concepts, their efforts to outdo each other is taken to ludicrous levels here, as it boils down to which one wants to die more. I also got the uneasy impression that certain men join a service such as Starfleet to escape normal life with the goal of giving up their own in a glorious pursuit of the fantastic, like walking barefoot into a live volcano on the chance they'd learn something no one else knows.",7
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Immunity Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",good plot; close analogy to the Doomsday Machine,"Its sometimes hard to get excited at fighting a giant amoeba compared to the terrifying looking Doomsday Machine! This show seems to be partly modelled on the previous Doomsday Machine episode where the Enterprise was also engaged in conflict with a creature of immense power that threatens to destroy all life in the galaxy. Unfortunately, there is no Commmodore Decker to bring added excitement to the episode though it was nice to see Spock volunteer to sacrifice himself on a near suicidal mission to save the Enterprise towards the end of the show...shades of the Wrath of Khan. I notice most people rate this episode an 8 out of 10 and I tend to agree. The special effects here are OK for a 1960's show.",8
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Immunity Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)","Trek does ""Fantastic Voyage""","I usually watch the episode and read a few other reviews before extolling an opinion. I also usually contemplate what might be the ""inner story"" of whatever it is that's bubbling under the surface of the plot.But not this time.This episode feels pretty contrived, but still entertaining in a science-fiction sort of way. At the time colored oil effects at dance parties were just coming into vogue, and it looks like the creative powers took that discovery and injected it into an episode of Trek. Essentially what was happening in culture at the time was young hip people were purchasing colored oil at the time and putting them on clear plastic sheets on overhead projectors during dances. They would then manipulate the colors by jostling the sheets. Well, here we have an amoeba incarnate via that bit of cultural artistry.Beyond that there isn't a whole lot to say about this episode. We see Kirk struggle with decisions, and we get the usual passionate verse logical persona conflicting for the task that will save ship and crew. We're also treated to a bit of an homage to ""Fantastic Voyage"", where a miniature sub and crew are injected into a human body. Trek does something similar, but blows stuff up to colossal proportions to utilize the same theme; i.e. the amoeba is titanic in scale, verse the Enterprise being shrunk to explore one.It's a good simple adventure yarn that passes the time. Not really a sterling episode, and somewhat worthy of a smirch, but Trek fans like myself will watch to pass away the hour by spending time with some of our favorite fictional characters.Give it a shot.",
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Immunity Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)","Intelligent, brooding episode that takes some getting used to.","The Enterprise flies out to investigate why the starship Intrepid and an entire solar system have been destroyed, and gets sucked into an energy-draining field. There, they find a giant organism, like a germ, that drains all life - including the Enterprise and the life energy of the people on board - as it pulls things towards it. The ship and crew are being drained slowly down to the point of death, and on top of that it looks like the organism is going to multiply, posing a danger to the whole galaxy. The crew races against time to find a way to destroy the organism before it is too late for everybody.The episode is excellent because it shows the Enterprise crew working as a team under pressure against an unknown and overwhelming threat. It touches on the idea of what it might mean if we really do explore the vast universe beyond our solar system, and presents the fascinating idea of a giant organism, like those that cause diseases in our own bodies, and the even more fascinating idea that perhaps we ourselves are antibodies protecting the vast body of our universe against foreign germs. And it presents the solid drama of Spock and McCoy competing to see who gets to be the pioneer/hero in the research of the threat. And it does all this with intelligence, eschewing hokey melodrama, embarrassing attempts at romance, or inane attempts at humor.At the same time, this episode is an acquired taste. There is no standard action and no bombastic plot twists. It is just a lot of atmosphere, carefully doled out foreboding, character development, and dialogue. There is also a lot of scientific and medical talk you have to listen to carefully in order to keep yourself updated on why you should care what is happening. It can be a little too dense for some people who are used to the kinds of dorky sci-fi lite episodes that Star Trek is sometimes guilty of.So, it gets a nine from me, but I can appreciate why some might want to rank it lower.",9
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Immunity Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",Star Trek: The Original Series - The Immunity Syndrome,"Going into ""The Immunity Syndrome"", I knew I had never seen it, and what joy I had to behold as it unfolded to me. What is truly special is that, as a Trekkie, I haven't yet watched every Original Series episode. I have watched a majority of them, for sure, but to see really, really great episodes (I think this one is a masterclass of Trek television) like ""The Immunity Syndrome"" makes the 50th anniversary re-visits all the more special. Every Trek fan has those key episodes that fit within their own personal criteria of what makes the very best the show had to offer.Every last minute of ""The Immunity Syndrome"" fit my own. The seemingly inexplicable killer that is out there in space ""absorbing"" stars, solar systems, and 400 Vulcans on the USS Intrepid (exploring that solar system which had billions of lives within it!). The knockout introduction of what lies ahead (Spock realizing that his own died, sensing their ""astonishment"" at the moment the space killer ""ate"", this is a fine piece of acting from Nimoy), the lack of answers Spock has for Kirk and how the ship is not only being drained of its energy and pulled towards this ""hole in space"" but also the life support systems are diminishing, how these feverish tremors rock the Enterprise and result in officers/crew deteriorating health-wise. Stimulus is injected in the Bridge crew (especially Kirk) to keep them going despite exhaustion from a previous mission that had taken its toll on the crew (the Enterprise was on their way to a well deserved rest and relaxation). Trying to find answers and getting ""insufficient data"" from Spock, the chief science officer, just leaves Kirk angst-ridden. How could it not? You have Bones trying to keep members of the crew (increasing in number as the ship loses to the space killer precious power, with Scotty having to deflect from one area to another, shields and warp and impulse) from passing out and /or dying. Bones and Spock continue to talk about their differences (Spock's comment about the Vulcan and human heart especially potent), and the competition for going into the shuttlecraft mission to study the space killer, with Kirk having to decide, is only bettered by the two leaving some passing words about ""who is the right man for the job"" and ""wishing the other good luck"".The mystery of the space killer, how it behaves irregularly, the ship not drained as quickly as the Intrepid due to the energy that had already been absorbed, how ""antimatter"" is discovered to actually be a deterrent against what emerges, and just the idea of this ""virus in space"" that could actually reproduce builds to quite an hour of television. Spock taking it upon himself to leave to study the amoeba-looking solar system eater and the information returned to the Enterprise suffering from interference, with Kirk having that ""aha"" moment when he thinks about what they're dealing with (Bones in this conversation helps to get to the possible answer), deciding to take the Enterprise right into it, it is an episode that never loses its grip. Good complementary moments where logs are made by both Spock and Kirk regarding their excellence, and the Enterprise finding the shuttlecraft, bookend this sterling example of Trek gold.That this virus was not a villain that purposely caused harm to our heroes, just functioning like a cancer, surviving by being drawn to energy, a negative energy being, makes for quite a unique threat.",10
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Immunity Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",I Recommend Survival.........,"The words Dr McCoy (one of my favorite characters on Star Trek) as he tells Captain Kirk to get the hell out of dodge, ""I recommend survival"", describes the gravity of the danger the Enterprise is in against the giant ""cell"" that has already killed BILLIONS. OK maybe the best line now that I am finishing this again is Spock saying ""Why thank you Captain McCoy"" sarcastically. Yes Trek fans, this is a major threat to all life as we know it in the Federation. A great episode in the best season of Star Trek. I would watch this show as a pre teen and teen in the 70's after school in random sequence and in that context it was hit or miss since a lot of season three would follow the great season one and two. Now watching this in order on DVD, I realize just how great season two was, there aren't really any ""bad"" episodes here, maybe a ""medicore"" one like ""Obsesion"", but all the rest in my book are very good to the best. This episode has great trilogy dialog between Kirk, Spock and McCoy when they rationalize who would take the suicide mission to pilot a shuttle-craft into the ""cell"". The exchange with Kirk telling McCoy to prepare the shuttle-craft and him thinking he would be going and than Kirk telling Spock he is sorry that he was chosen is great, as is the McCoy/Spock farewell. It further establishes the friendship/rivalry of the two, one that would also be used to great effect in the season three episode ""The Empath"". McCoy was determined to be as Mr Spock said here ""a martyr"". Some observations from me, having watched this series and episode many times, Mr Kyle is at the helm, wearing a yellow shirt, not his typical red, this must have been when George Takai was making the movie ""The Green Berets""; he received a special commendation from Captain Kirk along with others, so he was a kind of a lost Trek cast member who looking at his bio here wasn't so lost after all since he became a Commander in Wrath Of Kahn. Also, the argument for having seat belts on the ship is well noted in this episode as a crewman is thrown quite hard over the railing as the Enterprise enters the cell and also Mr Spock in the shuttle-craft. Great subtle sexual ending where Kirk is eying a hottie crewmen saying he is looking forward to some rest and relaxation as Scottie and McCoy smile, you have got to love the 23rd century! Probably why I joined the Navy and the saying ""Sailors have more fun"" is definitely true! Those younger viewers than me (I am assuming they are) who are watching this episode and put off by a cell conquering the galaxy should take into account that this was still new science with a color image of a cell being so detailed, color TV was also very new, thank God Trek was made in color, and on film! I would also say that I enjoy sci fi more than some because I have a suspension of belief, I like to think that what I am seeing could have happened, so it is real.Only a few Redshirt crewmen of the Enterprise were harmed in this episode (though several hundred Vulcan ones died aboard the Starship Intrepid).LLAP",9

In fact it was life in its most basic form after exponentially increasing to the size of a couple of solar systems.No doubt in the world about what to do with a one cell organism that size. It can't think and reason, all it does is eat and reproduce and we don't want more than one of those roaming around the galaxy.Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley do take their rivalry to some absurd levels in this episode. Nevertheless the whole Enterprise team pulls together as a team to beat this thing.How do you deal with an organism? Go back to biology one for the answer.",7
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Immunity Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",Very poor plot but exceptional dialog and characterizations,"This is a very unusual episode because the main story idea isn't all that good and the episode is mostly stuck on board the ship (no cool alien species here) BUT it's still a good episode. That's because while the idea isn't so hot, the execution comes off very well. In particular, the dialog is excellent with some very memorable lines and the character development is excellent--the depth of the characters and their love and concern for each other are given a chance to be more fully explored. When the chips are down, the traditional three-some of Spock, Kirk and McCoy have some great moments such as when the decision to leave the ship on a certain-death mission occurs and when McCoy and Spock exchange some funny barbs. In particular, I loved it when McCoy was barking out orders from the bridge when Spock was in trouble and Spock said ""thank you CAPTAIN McCoy"". It was just one of those moments you had to see and hear for yourself.",8
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Immunity Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",Another decent episode,"Once again, the crew are tired after several difficult missions, and they are off to seek some ""shore leave"" R and R, when trouble mysteriously and suddenly erupts. Mr Spock's psychic powers are on display as he senses the horrific deaths of 400 Vulcan crew members on the Intrepid. It appears a giant one celled organism is destroying everything in sight. How to combat it? It seems to operate illogically. Our Science and Medical officers spar with each other verbally to see who will get to go investigate the situation in person, via the Shuttle craft, although there is a high likelihood of death for the person involved.There are some very poignant moments here, as both Mr Spock and Captain Kirk anticipate their probable demise and recommend post- humous commendations for officers and crew members in their ships' logs. OK, I got choked up. Fortunately, the commendations were not necessary as the ship destroys the organism and Scotty pulls the ship away, just in the nick of time, using a paper clip and a post- it note. Mr Spock also returns unharmed.",7
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Immunity Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",The Enterprise encounters a deadly Space-Amoeba,"One their way to so well deserved R&R the Enterprise and her crew are sent to investigate what happened to the USS Intrepid, a ship crewed entirely by Vulcans, that suddenly died. Further scans show it wasn't just the ship was lost; there is no sign of life in a system that previously had billions of inhabitants. Upon arriving at the scene they discover a dark area of space. When entered the ships energy starts to drain as does that of its crew. Inside this area they find a gigantic single cell creature; like a giant amoeba, which seems to feed on energy. To investigate further Kirk must decide whether Spock or McCoy should pilot a shuttle mission to examine the creature more closely.This episode might not feature strange alien worlds or a battle of wits against an intelligent foe but it more than makes up for it with a good character driven drama. The space-amoeba is suitably threatening and nicely sets up a dilemma for Kirk; both McCoy and Spock provide him with good reasons for flying the shuttle to investigate the creature, whichever he chooses it is likely that he will lose a friend and he can't choose neither as without vital data they would lose the Enterprise. The acting from leads William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley is great in these scenes. The special effects look pretty good; at least they do in the remastered version. The plot may be simple but there is plenty of tension and the threat is one of the most dangerous they have faced given that it has already killed billions. Overall I'd say this was pretty good even if it isn't quite a classic episode.",7
14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Immunity Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",Another Roadblock in the Path of the Enterprise,"The primary force to be dealt with is a giant one celled organism (a amoeba). it has destroyed a Vulcan ship and all on board. It is up to Kirk and the gang to figure out what to do. It seems that this thing thrives on energy and when attacked simply absorbs it, destroying anything that it encounters. The problem, along with the obvious threat, is that it is beginning to split, and like other mono-cellular entities, it will divide again and again, eventually expanding throughout the galaxy. It is decided that someone must take a shuttle and investigate the interior and a find a way to prevent its forming a second creature. There is quite a bit of byplay between Spock and McCoy. McCoy wants to go into the thing and Spock accuses him of having a martyr complex. Spock is correct when he says he has the qualifications to take the shuttle in. This is a human story where men who know and love one another must make life or death decisions. Kirk chooses Spock even though he knows it is probably a suicide mission. A weakness, I guess, is the reason this thing exists in the first place. If it is a cell, shouldn't there be more of them around. What gave birth to it. It looks just like the one we drew in a biology class lab my sophomore year of high school. This is a tense episode and works pretty well.",8
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Immunity Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",The Enterprise attacks a giant amoeba,"The Immunity Syndrome"" feels like a first-season episode  not a lot of action, but plenty of drama. In most other TOS episodes, the villain is an alien race or some psychotic member of the Federation. In this episode, the villain is a giant amoeba. Not one of Trek's more memorable villains. I hated this episode when I was a younger. Not enough action, no planet to visit, Klingons to fight or Trek babe to drool over. But it seems to grow on me as I get older. I can appreciate this episode for the drama and certainly don't consider it a stinker anymore. However, I wouldn't put in the top half of best Treks, though it's probably somewhere near the top of the bottom half. I'm giving ""The Immunity Syndrome"" a C+ grade.",5
16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Immunity Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",Enterprise vs. Amoeba,"In ""The Immunity Syndrome"", the Enterprise is en route to shore leave when they receive orders to investigate the disappearance of the Klingon vessel the Intrepid. Spock's Vulcan ""intuition"" makes him realize that the ship and its crew is dead. The Enterprise finds a blotch of dark, empty space where stars and galaxies used to exist. After getting sucked into this empty space, they find themselves being pulled in by some type of giant amoeba. The amoeba feeds off energy, sucking the power out of the Enterprise and slowly killing the crew.Captain Kirk needs to figure out who to escape the clutches of this organism. To do this, they must send a manned probe via shuttlecraft into the amoeba. Bones and Spock both volunteer, leaving Kirk with a tough decision. Spock is the one ordered to go and take scientific tests on this suicide mission; they hope that this will lead to a way to kill the organism. Through data gathered by Spock, Kirk realizes that the organism feeds off energy and matter, so an antimatter bomb should do the trick.The Enterprise allows itself to be eaten by the organism so it can place the antimatter in the amoeba's nucleus. The antimatter tears the organism apart; the Enterprise grabs the shuttlecraft via tractor beam at the last possible second, saving Spock. The crew heads for shore leave once again.There's something terrifying about being pulled towards this deadly thing at a snail's pace. It doesn't immediately attack you, it's a slow, dreadful process. This really works in the episode's favor, probably my favorite part.Everything else about this episode felt fairly pedestrian. The acting is fine, the plot moves along okay, the visual effects of the amoeba are a bit dated (as to be expected) and very of their time period. Spock and Bones jockeying to make a ""big scientific discovery"" seems kind of weird since it's regarded as a suicide mission. It negates the dangerous elements of the episode a bit, lowering the stakes for the viewer. I do like when he tells Spock to shutup, he's getting saved. Great line.",7
17,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Immunity Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",believe sufficient charge of..,"Star TrekThe Immunity SyndromeA cultural hub and by far one of the most loved and respected tale, Star Trek is created by Gene Roddenberry who wrote this brilliant concept, ahead of its time and is probably why it still doesn't fail to entertain us after these many years. It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. After a good run on its first season, the second season has more expectations to fulfill and hopefully they will try to develop the character a bit more and focus on the relations between the crew members on the enterprise to blend in and communicate easily with the audience despite of just focusing on more mind-numb missions that sometimes feel like they are filling their time and work in.The scrutiny is convoluted, electrifying and contains some good conversations that helps The Immunity Syndrome enter it onto a major league where it redefines the series and its ingenious and meticulous approach to the simplest thing possible and still creates something colossal out of it.",
18,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Immunity Syndrome (TV Episode 1968)",If it wasn't for the Doomsday Machine this would be a better episode.,"Basically it's a solar system killer. A disease to the galaxy. If it wasn't for the Doomsday Machine this would be a better episode. Doomsday was much better because of the originality, the acting/characters, the machine itself. But what we have with this is a living creature that can reproduce. The acting is solid here. But what they should have concentrated more on is how it came about, and are there more out there. In the remastering they could have even shown it splitting in two just as the Enterprise was blowing it up. It's not in the original script but that would have added more tension and visuals.Great idea, again without the Doomsday Machine, even though it's a solid idea but not completely original.Best parts are the acting of Spock and McCoy. Great conversation.",7
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Private Little War (TV Episode 1968)","War isn't a Good Life, but it's Life (and a Mugato)","This is the serious attempt to present the impact and ramifications of interfering with the natural progression of a culture (the comedic take was ""A Piece of the Action"" a couple of episodes earlier). In this case, the culprits are (surprise!) Klingons: on a peaceful planet, the Klingons supply one side, Villagers, with flintlocks/rifles, while the Hill People, led by an old friend (Tyree) of Kirk's, continue to use bows & arrows. The balance of power has been upset, not to mention that Kirk's memories of a 'Garden of Eden' world have been corrupted. This is actually an interesting glimpse into Klingon strategy: they build up one side of a civilization as a puppet kingdom, to be a part of their growing empire. See also ""Friday's Child"" for the previous Klingon-Federation conflict over a planet. What this episode was soon known as by Trekkers is as the 'Vietnam' parable of the series.This allusion to Vietnam doesn't stay subtle - Kirk even makes reference to the 20th century 'brush wars' on the Asian continent to spell things out to the audience. There's a sometimes preachy tone and flowery references to serpents (the rifles) which overlooks the awful true impact of war, that being widespread bloody death. McCoy addresses this as best he can, but Kirk merely waves away such dire consequences with a trite comment about what war is. Despite a rather simplistic 'kill or be killed' theme for such a politically charged episode, it does drive home the point well that once something like flintlocks are introduced into such a civilization, you can't just take them back. Pandora's Box, such as it is, has been opened and it's too late to close it. And there are no easy solutions. McCoy represents the liberal side here with his protests and he offers no other solution. Kirk is the conservative view - Klingons started this and it's out of his hands now. As such, they have one of their more intense arguments in this episode and neither wins.Then we have the Mugato. It's a white apelike animal with a lizard-like spine and tail. The monster suit was probably effective in the sixties; now it looks like some goon escaped a Halloween parade to chase Shatner and Kelley around the wilderness (OK, it did scare me a bit when I was eight years old). Add to this the whole witch-woman routine by Tyree's wife and we're in unintentional amusement territory. However, quite intentionally, this episode also presents a 'B' storyline up on the Enterprise, where Spock is recovering from a gunshot wound. My favorite scene is Nurse Chapel slapping the bedridden Spock as Scotty runs in, quite alarmed. This all explains another facet of the Vulcan mystique and physiology. Rather inspired.",7
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Private Little War (TV Episode 1968)",Cheesy-waxing philosophical about war,"The cheese factor is very high in this one, but that's part of what I find attractive in the original series.This episode waxes philosophical about war--a fairly common theme on the original series, which was made all the more poignant because it aired smack dab in the middle of the Cold War. Like usual, Gene Roddenberry (along with story writer Judd Crucis) has apt things to say about war and the necessity of taking up arms should an opposing group choose to do the same. More strongly, and this is especially relevant in retrospect, here in the early 21st Century, the crux of the episode is really superpowers creating/supporting/funding wars among third world peoples.But as good as it can get on philosophical content, Star Trek excels because of its peculiar mixture of often cheesy or at least cheesily played elements, and this episode has that in spades. Not one, but two principal cast members almost die as they visit that same rocky scrub brush location in California again that always stands for some different planet. Another principle cast member is injured. This time they meet up with some ridiculously wigged primitive folks--one of whom Captain Kirk became friendly with on his first mission to another planet over a decade before. While there, they meet and fight with a ridiculously costumed ""mugato"" (maybe the problem was that they forgot the traditional ""Domo arigato, Mr. Mugato"" greeting?), and a ridiculously hot and beautiful Nona (Nancy Kovack), a member of a ""witch tribe"". This latter fact leads to some romantic scenes for Kirk, of course, and even a pretty racy (for prime time television in 1968) ""healing"" scene. This episode is also the source of a very humorous way of waking Vulcans out of a particular kind of ""meditative"" state.",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Private Little War (TV Episode 1968)","""He is mine now"".","Aside from the barely disguised political commentary, this episode is almost unintentionally funny with it's blond coiffed hill people, and a creepy mahko root that's used by a Kahn-ut-tu woman to nurse Captain Kirk back to health following a near fatal battle with a Mugato. That Mugato was interesting, I kept thinking a cross between a gorilla and a prehistoric Stegosaurus, you know, one of those Stegorilla's.This might have been the closest the series ever got to delivering actual soft porn, what with Nona's (Nancy Kovack) tantalizing healing dance over Kirk's prone body. Nona caps it with her analysis of the procedure - ""It brought up evil beasts from my soul"". Evil beasts indeed, giving particular new meaning to the term soul-mates.One thing I like about the show's mythology is the way the scripts kept bringing in new facets of Vulcan character and physiology. In this one, it's revealed that the Vulcan form of self healing involves physical pain to regain consciousness in extreme cases. The story gives Nurse Chapel another chance to show that she pines for Spock's attention, but as usual, that goes nowhere. Slapping him around would have been the next best thing I suppose.With the Vietnam War picking up tempo in the late Sixties, the show's political lens takes a look at the Balance of Power argument used by analysts to describe the way nations seek to level the playing field when they're not seeking outright advantage. In that respect, Kirk has no problem violating the Noninterference Directive to help out old friend Tyree (Michael Witney) and his hill people. I had to chuckle though, when the opposing side was called by name. With a little better costuming, they would have fit right into their description as the village people.",7
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Private Little War (TV Episode 1968)",Campy commentary on wars of conquest,"Gene Roddenberry was obviously interested in the theme of technologically more advanced superpowers taking over developing societies. This and ""Friday's Child,"" another not-so-good episode, both feature the Klingons and Federation duking it out over a planet harboring a less technologically developed civilization. The Klingons in this episode are much like the Europeans who invaded North America, and ravaged the indigenous people with guns, diseases... (OK, the indigenous people were not just peaceful nature lovers, they hunted all the American megafauna to death, and warred with one another.) Roddenberry was also interested in 1960s wars, such as the Cold one and Vietnam, and the story equally well serves as a parable for Chinese and Americans duking it out in Vietnam. Indeed, the episode ""Assignment: Earth,"" which is much better than ""A Private Little War,"" takes on the same subjects but with the opposite point of view. Gene must have done well in debate class before he joined the LAPD. That is actually a plus in my book: Roddenberry did take on touchy topics in TOS, and ultimately good SF is about real human problems and relationships, not imaginary hardware.In this episode, Kirk revisits a planet he scouted 13 years earlier. Back then, he recommended it be left to develop in peace. Now the Klingons are arming one indigenous tribe against another. Spock and McCoy both counsel Kirk against escalation. Spock points out it is against the prime directive, McCoy explains that escalation is never a solution - although he can't think of anything better to do. Kirk escalates, the McNamara of this episode. It's now 40 years after Vietnam, and we have learned that escalation is never a good solution. So Spock and McCoy were right, as was the leader of the culturally less contaminated tribe, who abhorred guns and killing. We still have not learned the lesson; otherwise, Bush the younger might have acted more like his father, who got out of Iraq immediately after ending their invasion of Kuwait. The episode is filled with some of the campiest effects, costumes and writing in all of TOS. Women with makeup that would be impossible to conjure on a pre-technology planet, even by a witch. Mugato lizard-apes that look like bad Godzilla costumes. Wigs on the tribesmen that make the Monkees look bald. (If you don't know what the Monkees are, this episode is too campy for you to watch.) The unintentional humor is quite humorous, as is the intentional. Like a scene where nurse Chapel, lusting after Spock as always, holds his hand while he's 'unconscious' in sickbay, and later has to slap him on doctor's orders.This episode shows that Roddenberry was really an idea man with commentary about humanity's problems, but he was not a gifted writer when it came to scripting it with the right level of human interest, leaving out what could not be done well on the available budget, etc. Fortunately TOS had many better writers, both in the humor department (like David Gerrold) and in the drama department (like Harlan Ellison).Watch this one if you must see all episodes; otherwise, check out Gary 7 and his cat in ""Assignment: Earth.""",5
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Private Little War (TV Episode 1968)",What happened next?,"What happened after Kirk (unusually) seemed to 'give-up' at the end of this episode? Earlier, he had said to Bones that if they found evidence that the Klingons were involved in arming the black-haired ones, there would be inter-stellar war. Well, Kirk found evidence of a Klingon's chin when he punched it in the forge. So why no inter-stellar war, that's what I want to know! There is also definite evidence here of a recyclable blond 'nice alien inhabitant' wig. At least one of the wigs worn by the goodies in this episode was worn in an earlier episode by an unrecognisably young David Soul. The wardrobe mistress (it was always 'mistress' then) could at least have combed the things down rather than leave them perched on top of the actor's head like a bird's nest just dropped out of a tree!",
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Private Little War (TV Episode 1968)",Prime definition of a bad day,"I didn't think much about this episode till I saw the end of it, then it hit me. It's seems no matter what the problem is, Kirk wants to solve it. He's determined to take care of it no matter how difficult it may be. Many of us can relate to his dilemma, especially towards the end. Life throws us obstacles every chance it gets, making things worse unless we deal with them on our terms.As you could plainly see in the end in this marvelous episode, nobody wins. Those are the moments where you can only tell yourself ""f*ck this, I'm going home"". You throw in the towel, accept defeat, try to figure out the lesson you were given and move on. Its the prime definition of a bad day.",8

Kirk spent time there 13 years earlier. Kirk, Spock and McCoy beam down. McCoy is fascinated by the medicinal plants on the planet, Spock is attacked and beams back up, Kirk looks for his friend Tyree. Kirk suspects Klingons has intervened with the natural progression of the planet by giving them weapons more advanced than they should have had for they are a primitive planet of people. None of the Enterprise's crew are allowed to use their phasers or other modern technology. Kirk is attacked and is dying... Nona the witch, Tyree's wife, heals Kirk and expects him to be grateful by giving her ""knowledge of the stars"". Once well, Kirk continues his investigation into Klingon interference and has to balance the power on the planet. Nona is still after the information from Kirk she seeks using her witchcraft. The Klingons contaminated the natural order with guns to their friends on the planet leaving the other half without means of equal defense. Kirk wants to even the score.Interesting enough episode. The struggles of power, a witch, Klingons, a friend of Kirk's and more... I like it.7/10",7
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Private Little War (TV Episode 1968)",More Than A Vietnam Allegory -- Coming of Age in a Fallen World,"Fifty years ago this was one of my top ten episodes of Star Trek. As a six year old kid I wanted action, fist fights, gunfire, and adventure. I wanted Kirk in action with his fists, fighting the bad guys. I also loved the low-tech feel of the muskets and the powder horns. This episode to me has the perfect balance of action, adventure, romance, and heartbreak.Now a lot of reviewers judge this episode solely on what it says (or fails to say) about the war in Vietnam. Certainly you can fault Gene Roddenberry for failing to take on the human cost of war -- this isn't Born On The Fourth of July. (Imagine a sequel where the Federation signs a peace treaty with the Klingons, and Kirk finds a wheelchair-bound Tyree in a bar, cursing Kirk for persuading him to enlist!)But the thing is, this episode may not have the ""answer"" to what went wrong in Vietnam. But it raises a lot of timeless questions about loss of innocence, the end of childhood, and the price of change. Many, many Star Trek episodes show Kirk running across someone he liked or admired before his five-year mission with the Enterprise. Usually the other person fails Kirk in some way -- they've become corrupt, or crooked, or simply gone insane.This time around, though, Kirk's friend Tyree is just as pure and just as innocent as Kirk remembered. The two of them were boys, once, hunting and fishing in the wilderness just like Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer. But now Tyree is a man, and a leader -- like Kirk. And that means he has to change in ways that are genuinely tragic. The arc of Tyree, from helpless and innocent to hardened and ruthless, really mirrors the price Kirk has paid to become a legendary star ship captain. And Kirk's sadness only makes the tragic journey more profound and meaningful.Tyree is the most likable and sympathetic companion of Kirk's ""younger days"" that we ever meet in the original series. I would also argue that of all the deadly, seductive women Kirk ever encountered, Nona is the most alluring and the most memorable. She's initially presented as being much more strong-willed and street-smart than her husband, and it's hard not to admire her genuine outrage at the way Kirk puts the Prime Directive above her husband' s survival. (""Then he has the wrong friends -- and I have the wrong husband!"") But the way she over-estimates her own charms and fatally under-estimates the brutal cruelty of the villagers makes for some of the most graphic and disturbing violence in the series. And watching Tyree deal with what follows is genuine drama.Everything is great about this episode -- even the big and furry Mugatu adds just right unintentional comic relief, a touch of campy silliness to offset the genuine sadness and the explosive drama!",8
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Private Little War (TV Episode 1968)",Awful ideological apologist episode to brainwash Americans,"If there had been too many like this one I would not have been enjoying watching the remastered series. And I don't mean the bad hairdo wigs the two tribes were wearing. This is such a blatant piece of US right wing self-justification for war mongering I'm surprised more people have not been appalled. I wouldn't have noticed when I first watched it when I was a teenager but as an adult I find the arguments simple minded pseudo-philosophical tripe of the silliest kind - all probably to justify what the Americans were doing in Vietnam. Even in terms of the fictional plot the conclusion to the dilemma is not logical. The Balance of Power must be maintained by arming the other side, naturally the other side are the good guys - blond naturally as an Aryan philosopher would have it. What other solution could there be? Well, obviously, destroy their weapons and prevent the arming of anybody would be an answer. And anyway Kirk already reminded us that the earthlings were nearly totally wiped out by the logical result of such an arms race - nuclear annihilation. And he wants them to suffer the same fate? It's all ridiculous. Thank goodness such ideological insertions were not too frequently overdone in the other episodes though of course it is clear that the values of the ""American way"" are what the Enterprise (=Private Enterprise) is carrying into space.I don't normally allow the now obvious ideological content of the original series to spoil my enjoyment of one of my all-time favourite TV series but in this case it was a bit too much.And that girl didn't need a potion to get Jim going- long eyelashes and sexy clothes were always enough for him!",
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Private Little War (TV Episode 1968)","If you don't laugh out loud at either the Mugatu or the wigs, then there is something seriously wrong with you.","Within the first 10 minutes both Kirk and Spock are near-mortally wounded. That's a bit much. In ST that was always a sign of lazy or uninspired writing: when the main characters get badly wounded or ""killed"", this being supposedly ""dramatic"". However, even that wasn't enough for the episode's writer, so later on even McCoy gets injured, albeit only slightly (it's one of those ""the bullet just scratched me"" movie-bullet injuries). And as if it weren't bad enough for Spock to be lying half-dead in sick bay, he has to endure the touching of that Gene Roddenberry bimbo harlot, Nurse Chapel, when she feels up his hand with her masculine paws.A planet of wig-wearing buffoons, easily manipulated by both Klingons and cheesy-looking witch-women, are the focal point of APLW. (Are you surprised? This is, after all, yet another shoddy Roddenberry script.)And yet Uhura tells us that these people are highly intelligent and are predicted to develop very rapidly. I beg to differ. They might become marginally successful as makers of silly B-movie wigs, but otherwise forget it... Or perhaps the wigs got there when they traded with the Space Swedes (""The Apple"" episode). The Swedes showed them how to make funny wigs, and in return the Mugatanians showed the Swedes how to write bad dialogue for themselves.Typically, we have a blond tribe - the goodies - and their enemies, the black-haired tribe: the baddies. Just like in all those laughably bad cave-people movies of the 60s and 70s. Blond is good? Hitler would have been proud... (Just kidding.) Dividing up tribes by HAIR COLOUR, just so the presumably moronic audiences can follow the story more easily, was a bit too campy, even for ST.Strangely enough, the planet's evil apes aren't black but blond (the wonderful Mugatus). The Mugatu is an unusual cross between an overgrown rooster and a female albino gorilla. Maybe the rooster and the gorilla met at an annual ""Animal Planet"" ball or something, then hijacked a NASA space shuttle, and flew to this distant planet for their honeymoon. But whether the Mugatu crows at the break of dawn or merely eats bananas we never get to find out; the Mugatus' appearances are brief, courtesy of the Enterprise phasers. So much for the Non-Interference Directive, which seems to only apply to intelligent life...APLW also features some rather unnecessary, preachy, political commentary in the form of a barely-disguised Cold War analogy. The conversation between Kirk (representing the Republican credo) and McCoy (playing the bleedin'-heart liberal Democrat) was the kind of ""socially/politically relevant"" (and now often dated) banter that I'd have preferred hadn't been used in ST at all. True sci-fi does not need to preach about present-day issues - in fact, it shouldn't. But, just like in real life, when Kirk asks McCoy if he has a better suggestion than starting an arms race, he says that he doesn't. Liberals never have (practical) solutions to problems: they're only good at being anti.In this episode, Gene Roddenberry tends to support the balance-of-power viewpoint, and yet in ""Assignment: Earth"", which he also wrote, he seems to take a different view. Go figure! Still, the man was a cop once, so that might explain the confusion in his head...APLW is an unintentionally very funny episode, with monsters, wigs, and spunky, adulterous witches (I thought for a moment the episode was called ""A Private Little Whore"") that should provide some good moments in what is generally a crap story.Most episodes with Klingons are sup-par. Thankfully, they're more talked about than actually seen in this episode.",
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Private Little War (TV Episode 1968)",Definitely sub-par but still watchable,"This is a pretty silly episode and it's pretty preachy as well--definitely NOT a good combination. As for silliness, some of the props were pretty bad, such as the guy in the white ape costume who was the dreaded ""Mugatu"" and the curative root that looked for all the world like a piece of quivering poo! Plus, the silly costumes were pretty bad--with the silly moppish wigs and the sexist hippie costume the main female character wore. And as for preachiness, the show is obviously a not very well-veiled morality tale about Vietnam and the whole notion of the Russians and Americans arming intermediaries in a proxy battle. Kirk and McCoy find that the peaceful people of the planet are inexplicably at war. The dark-haired guys are shooting the blond guys for sport--even though technologically, the planet had only recently been centuries away from the development of flintlocks. Now, Kirk is seriously considering giving the pacifistic blonds weapons to even the balance of power. There is a lot of action and excitement, but that's really about all the episode has going for it.",5
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Private Little War (TV Episode 1968)",Illogical - not up to par,"This episode is notable for the Mugato and for raising some important issues. However, it doesn't live up to the folklore of Star Trek as challenging the status quo of its time (sexism, racism, sexuality, and other social policies). Well, it did challenge some minor sexual taboos of its era.The big disappointment is that the forced resolution is not logical at all. Perhaps Spock's illness explains why Kirk could not find a real solution, but he recovered in time and should have set things straight.McCoy and Kirk confirmed that the flintlock forge was a sham. The metals used were too pure to have been made by the villagers; the techniques such as cold-rolling were too advanced for the tools on hand; they had drill bits that were impossible to make locally; and it was clear that the Klingons were violating a treaty by providing any of this. In what way could Kirk think that the situation was fait accompli?Another reviewer claimed that it was too late to take back the weapons - once introduced, there's no way to remove them. I disagree completely. It would seem that Star Fleet would have had the power to embargo the planet, protect it from further contamination, and forcibly take all of the existing weapons and tools from the villagers. Their scanners should have been able to locate all of the weapons, and a quick wide area stun would render everyone unconscious long enough to deprive them of their weapons and advanced tools. Considering the poor forging tools, there's no way the villagers could have actually manufactured their own weapons. Even if they could, it would take a while for them to develop actual skills to make weapons that wouldn't explode in their faces, and The Federation would have had time to come up with a better solution. Certainly Star Trek is generally known for suggesting better solutions than arming a peaceful hill people with weapons that would have already been behind the next stage of technology that the Klingons were planning to provide to the villagers on their next trip.Sorry, but this one is not up to par - and that's already accounting for the poor science in the original series.",3

As the team prepare to leave Spock is shot and seriously injured. While he is being treated a Klingon ship is sighted and Kirk is convinced that they are responsible for arming the people on the planet. Leaving Spock in the capable hands of Dr M'Benga, Kirk and McCoy return to the planet to investigate further. Soon after landing Kirk is attacked by a creature with a poisonous venom; unable to return to the ship McCoy takes him to the village of his old friend Tyree where he is cured by Tyree's wife. We learn that there are two main tribes; the peaceful Hill People and the Villagers who are using weapons against them. Tyree's wife wants him to press Kirk to supply even better weapons and she who, with the help of a few select plants, can be very persuasive. When it is confirmed that the Klingons have helped the Villagers Kirk has a difficult decision; does he stay uninvolved or does he arm the Hill People to create a balance of power?This isn't a classic episode but it is entertaining. Thanks to Spock's injury we learn more about the Vulcans; in particular how they consciously fight to heal themselves. The story on the planet was interesting too; clearly a metaphor for the various proxy wars of the cold war era where the East and West would arm allies in third world countries rather than getting involved in direct conflict. The yeti-like creature which attacked Kirk was pretty laughable; clearly a man in a costume and the hairstyles of the native population was pretty funny. Tyree's wife, Nona, is perhaps a little too sexy in her furry bikini top I don't imagine she'd really need strange herbs to distract Kirk! The conclusion was most satisfying; it was interesting to see Kirk having to go with the least bad option rather than being able to solve the problems caused by Klingon interference on the planet.

It's the same here on this planet where many years ago before he was the captain of the Enterprise Kirk spent some time incognito studying the primitive planet and making friends with Michael Witney who was leader of the 'Hill People'. They were basically just coming out of a stone age culture then. Coming back Leonard Nimoy is wounded by a musket ball from a flintlock rifle. Clearly someone is messing with the culture.It turns out to be the Klingons, but they don't know of the Enterprise's presence in the area. It's William Shatner and DeForest Kelley who go back and in native attire to investigate.They also have a run in with Nancy Kovack who is Witney's wife and a witch woman with some marvelous healing and erotic powers. When she gets a look at the phasers that Kirk and McCoy have she knows that whoever possesses those is definitely on top of the heap in that planet.Of course in all of this Kirk is violating the Prime Directive, but the Klingons did it first so we have to keep things in balance for this culture to develop as normally as possible considering they accelerated several hundred earth years.As for the natives, like the Hawaiians destined to be pawns in the imperial designs of two super powers.",8

In this episode of Star Trek, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy beam down to a planet the captain spent time on a decade before, looking at soil samples and plant life for their possible medical achievements. However, two ""tribes"" of people seem to be at the cusp of war, fueled by flintrock primitive guns on a violent-preferred group called the Mugatos who are inspired to overthrow the peaceful people led by Kirk's friend on the planet, Tyree (Michael Witney). Tyree kept silence about Kirk and the Federation (they were studying the planet and their development, similar to Earth's centuries ago), but the Klingons, also orbiting the planet, decide to pollute the development of the people with their knowledge of advance weaponrypressing Kirk to do so with the disadvantaged Tyree's tribe. Bones brings up the Prime Directive, and Kirk assuages this with what the Klingons done to shake up the ""balance of power"". This leads to violence, death, and hate. Spock, for chrissakes, is shot in the back by one of the Mugatos' flintrock rifles! Dr. M'Benga (Booker Bradshaw) is a cool character, a Vulcan medical specialist who is quite vital to Spock's survival once Kirk and Spock beam down to the planet (disguised as Tyree's tribe) to try and ""update"" their situation (maybe ""upgrade"" is a better term to use) since the Klingons have provided weapons ""advancement"" to the Mugatos, a tribe hungry for using violence, with little regard for the lives of another people. Tyree is a pacifist, against violence, while his mate, Nona (the feisty, delicious Nancy Kovack), seeks for his tribe to overcome the Mugatos so she can be queen to a superior leader. Nona sees Bones using his phaser to heat bricks near the dying body of Kirk (he was attacked by a creature native to the planet, its bite poisonous to the human body), inspiring her to gain knowledge of this considering it could be used to help her man usurp the Mugatos. A root she has, along with her blood as a mix, helps to cull the poison in Kirk's wound. She also has this root that can influence as an aphrodisiac, giving her an advantage over the men, doing so in instances with Tyree and Kirk. Even securing Kirk's phaser, Nona seems like she'd betray her own if the Mugatos took her to their leader, but they're primal lust is more important to them. Kirk and Tyree's men engage in fisticuffs with the Mugatos, with Nona taking a blade to the torso. This is the catalyst in Tyree, now no longer a pacifist, filled with hate, requesting rifles from Kirk to do battle with the Mugatos. It leaves a bad taste, but when Kirk asks Bones what other solution is possible, he has no answerthe Klingons have soiled what was ""Eden"". Kirk must now bring more ""serpents to the once perfect garden"". A message that is loud and clear, preaching from the pulpit. Truthfully, I get the point, and seeing Kirk tired and depressed of what his actions have only inflamed, not discouraged, is purposefully a drag. Violence solves nothing, and that is left with us after the episode ends.",5

The planet is a primitive one, with villagers and ""hill people"" living in peaceful harmony. But the crew arrives and finds a much different culture than the one Kirk left. The villagers have somehow quickly progressed enough to develop flintlock rifles, an absurdly quick evolution that Kirk finds hard to believe. Battle now rages between the townspeople and Kirk's friends the hill people. Kirk suspects Klingon intervention. Him and Bones investigate the situation while an ailing Spock, shot earlier in the episode by a villager, fights for his life. Kirk is attacked a wild beast, only to be saved by a hill person witch doctor who tries to convince him to give her people superior weapons for their war. Bones worries about escalating the fighting further and disobeying the Prime Directive.Kirk's suspicion of Klingon involvement is correct. A proxy war between the Federation and the Klingon Empire begins to take shape. The witch doctor steals a phaser from Kirk and becomes a turncoat, attempting to assist the villagers against a pacifist hill people. She is eventually killed in a melee, causing anger from the hill people. A revived Spock returns to the planet with the Enterprise. An all-out war seems imminent as the Enterprise extracts itself from the situation, a dark cloud hanging over the planet.Star Trek has never shied away from a political allegory and this episode lays it on thick. This feels like less of a metaphor for the Vietnam War and more of a full-on homage, right down to the ""good guys"" having white hats and the ""bad guys"" having black ones.Despite the heavy-handedness, this episode is still fairly enjoyable. The monster is a bit silly looking but in a fun way. Learning more about the Vulcan culture is always a plus for me and we get to learn a decent amount about Vulcan physiology in this one. Plus, we see a few fun fight scenes and a weirdly gross scene involving some type of root.There is this weird sub-plot about the witch-doctor now owning Kirk which never really comes to fruition. She ends up having to put an odd spell on him, completely separate from the local legend hinted at. I'm not really sure what that's all about.This episode might be a bit forgettable but, in the moment, it's an enjoyable 50 minutes.",6

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. After a good run on its first season, the second season has more expectations to fulfill and hopefully they will try to develop the character a bit more and focus on the relations between the crew members on the enterprise to blend in and communicate easily with the audience despite of just focusing on more mind-numb missions that sometimes feel like they are filling their time and work in.A Private Little War is witty and most importantly a mature one that makes it stand alone than any other episode as it manages to keep it off-the-point with an engaging distraction for the audience and still keeps it to-the-point where all the credit goes to the writer.",

It has a kind of fast working venom that leaves him delirious and sick. Spock is also shot in the back by one of the men with the rifles. The people that rescue Kirk are a peaceful lot, generally. Among them is an old friend of Kirk's, a guy who will only fight as a last resort. He has a dark haired wife who wears fur underwear. She has her eyes on Kirk's phaser (sounds kind of nasty, doesn't it?). She figures if she uses her witching techniques on him and heals him, she will be rewarded with the weapon. Kirk can't allow that. This gets complicated when she hits him with a rock and takes it anyway. The issue ultimately involves whether Kirk should give weapons of equal strength to this friendly race.

In a region of space where no other Federation ship has yet been, the Enterprise comes across a planet with three impressive survivors. All that remains of these beings is pure energy, their bodies lost in some cataclysmic war fought 500,000 years ago. They're somewhere between the Metrons (""Arena"") and the Organians (""Errand of Mercy"") in terms of unimaginable power, their minds capable of feats that 23rd-century humanity can scarcely dream of. So they've been waiting around in these containment globules for half-a-million years, waiting for their probable descendants to start exploring the spaceways (this is one of those episodes, echoed in a TNG show, which might explain the proliferation of similar humanoid lifeforms throughout the galaxy).So what were they waiting for? To simply borrow three humanoid bodies in order to construct android shells for themselves. They borrow Kirk's (now call him Sargon), Spock's (now Henoch,from the 'other' side) and Dr. Mulhall's (now Thalassa); have no fear, Sargon is here. All very simple, as McCoy sarcastically puts it. But, there's a kink in the plans. Apparently, Henoch hasn't spent the past half million years contemplating peaceful pursuits; we learn this in short order when Spock's face assumes an uncharacteristically evil grin as Henoch confidently makes plans to remove Sargon from the equation and take over (I guess) everything. Now, for purposes of this story, Henoch, for all his supposed brilliance, proves to be very short sighted and impatient. If he really wanted to rule the galaxy...but, I suppose Sargon just stuck in his craw and he couldn't wait (half-a-million years of frustration spilling out). And we get to see Nimoy act out a sadistic villain - there's a creepy chilling tone to at least one scene.I was also puzzled as to why, for all their amazing abilities, these beings were unable to construct androids with receptors for feeling. This was the crux of their ambivalence at the halfway point in the story, that the sensations experienced by their temporary human bodies would be lost in android form (see ""Catspaw"" and ""By Any Other Name"" as other examples of aliens becoming seduced by our surprisingly addictive bodies). And with Henoch out of the way, shouldn't that have opened the door for Sargon & Thalassa to proceed? Oh, well. Then we have Kirk's speech, about risk - yes, this endeavor was risky, no kidding. Others may jump at the chance to point out Shatner's over-emoting. But, it's a great speech. It sums up the goal of the entire series, the TNG series, and, to a lesser extent, the subsequent follow-ups - all in one fell swoop with about 5 minutes of wondrous trailblazing and preaching to a faltering choir. Hell, it summed up the true destiny of all mankind. Where else on TV can you hear such a speech? 'If Man was Meant to Fly...'",8

No, it is not just love. If Sargon loves his wife and vice versa, they'd love each other as energy contained in a receptacle, as minds contained in androids bodies or in any other place. But in their human bodies they can ""feel"", which means kissing and touching each other, which is the way of depicting sex in 60's television. In the beginning, Sargon threatens the crew telling them that if they let him perish, human race would have to perish also. Apparently, the writer forgot he wrote that line, because from then on the man is nicer than bread, and claims he'd like to teach humankind great technological advances and how to avoid committing the same mistakes they made. Well, I actually would have love to see some of those advances came true and how the crew would deal with these superior minds they brought back to life and who were now transforming everything as they pleased. But, instead, they ended up depicting them as humans who only wanted to express their love physically... which is fine, but it's a theme that has already been explored repeatedly in this series, and I was hoping more sci-fi here than cheesy romance. Kirk kissing all chicks around is fun, but it gets kinda tiresome the 100th time. Spock playing evil is fun to watch.

Shatner, as we'd expect, hams it up, but that's what I like. It's sublimely enjoyable to watch him writhe in agony, build up to an eventually shouted, crazy monologue in even more bizarrely stilted speech than normal, and sweat like an overweight nerd on his first high school appointment with the backseat of a car. As good as that is, Nimoy's performance is even more fun, because he has another excuse to wallow in emotions, and he takes advantage of it to treat us to one of the most twisted but cordial and smiling psychopaths ever. Other performances in this episode are just as entertaining, even if they're not stretching as much. DeForest Kelley has many opportunities to fly off the handle as McCoy, and Majel Barrett gets to play the ultimate ""wooden"" towards the end of the story.On a smarmier hormonal note, I know I just commented on how gorgeous Barbara Bouchet was in By Any Other Name, but holy cow, Diana Muldaur is just as breathtaking here. I guess Star Trek had more clout by the middle of the second season to snag unbelievably beautiful actresses for one-off parts.By the way, am I the only one who thinks that the Kiss song, ""100,000 Years"" may have been influenced by this episode?

Dr McCoy's objections are warranted and well expressed, but a final centerpiece speech by Kirk explains the risks and rewards of flight, space flight, sciences and alien encounter. He states ""Risk is our business"" in a well written and delivered plea. One of the best staff briefing scene in all of Star Trek, I would even say.The rest of the episode deals with the concepts of awareness, android, consciousness, love, loyalty, life and eternity.

They have been in these spheres for centuries and they would like to become corporeal for a while. After McCoy issues his usual paranoiac message, Kirk gives a speech, and the good doctor succumbs.

The problem is that the guy who is in Spock's body has designs on the pretty young woman. He takes over the brain of nurse Christine Chapel.

At that point I only liked the episodes where Kirk got into a lot of fistfights and fired his phaser. And especially the episodes where the Enterprise fired all its phasers at another ship!Fifty years later . . .This episode, which I hardly noticed as a little kid, is now a favorite. It's haunting, tragic, deeply romantic, dream like, and sensual. The idea that god like aliens long to be human, to have all the feelings and emotions we take for granted, is deeply inspiring. It's all the more poignant because they speak to us in the voices of people we already love, like Kirk and Spock and the incomparably lovely Ann Mulhall. I loved how the ""temptation"" of Thelessa was so Biblical, with the suave Henoch in the role of the serpent.People joke about the plot, but from an acting perspective it must have been so liberating for William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy to take on these ""dual"" roles as aliens inhabiting the bodies of Kirk and Spock. Shatner gets to play a man who is quite different from James T. Kirk. Sargon is a great leader, a hero, but he's no playboy. He's dignified and caring and his scenes with his lost love are unbelievably touching. And for Nimoy to be able to step out from behind Spocks' shadow and play a truly Satanic villain must have been a real thrill. I think Henoch is one of the best Original Series villains and I think Leonard Nimoy deserves a lot of credit for bringing him to life!Private joke: when Sargon talks about spending thousands of years searching the universe for passing ships to help, he says something like, ""Always waiting, always probing, probing, waiting, probing.""

It turns out Sargon is a being of pure energy; a consciousness stored in a glowing sphere. He 'possesses' Kirk and explains that he and two similar fellow survivors must occupy the bodies of Kirk, Spock and Mulhall so they can build androids to act as permanent hosts. There are two problems; while possessed the human bodies are put under potentially dangerous stresses and one of their number has decided he would rather keep Spock's body than live in an unfeeling android body.This is an entertaining episode even though it was clearly cheap even by the standards of the series; we don't see the surface of any strange planets, there is no alien makeup and most of the action takes place in a few rooms on the Enterprise. It is the fact that the dangers come from aliens possessing the bodies of crew members that the danger somehow seems more real; we might know that Kirk and Spock will ultimately survive but the same can't be said for the previously unseen Mulhall; even Kirk didn't seem to know who she was! The cast do a fine job playing the possessed characters; Shatner hams it up delightfully and guest star Diana Muldaur is good as Mulhall but it is Leonard Nimoy who steals the show as we see his normally emotionless Spock start smiling in a most creepy fashion while possessed by the entity Henoch.

They need to borrow some of the bodies of the Enterprise crew in order to then fashion android bodies for themselves. You'd really think that being that powerful, they wouldn't need to go through all this rigmarole! Well, regardless, there are three super-beings still alive after all these many, many millenia and so Kirk, Spock and Diana Muldaur's character allow the three beings to use their bodies temporarily.

Not that he could have prevented it as the story line went, but he could have shown a bit of angst over the idea.What's cool here is seeing a possessed Spock plotting his takeover of the Enterprise and who knows, the entire known galaxy and beyond. It's probably just a bit too convenient the way the Henoch entity was disabled by a simple shot to the arm; what happened to all that mental energy building power over a half million years? But having the 'real' Spock share his essence with Nurse Chapel was a clever device. You know she thought so too; didn't she look positively giddy over the idea that she wound up spending some quality time with her favorite Vulcan?For Kirk's part, not only does he get a chance to be chummy with a member of the crew (Diana Muldaur as Dr. Ann Mulhall), but he doesn't have to take responsibility.

They want to exist in the bodies of the humans they have chosen as they set out to create robotic bodies to house their forms, but Henoch is eyeing Thalassa for himself, loving the body of Spock, initiating a scheme to murder Kirk's body and hopefully rival, Sargon, as well. Nurse Chapel (Majel Barrett) is to help Henoch kill Kirk by using a Vulcan mind manipulation without her knowing what he has her doing.This will probably best remembered for a couple of key scenes and performances. Nimoy did get chances to evoke emotion besides the cold and analytical Vulcan. ""Return to Tomorrow"" allowed him to play a scheming, mischievous, cold-blooded sociopath with a twinkle in his eye and a cat-that-ate-the-canary grin. Thalassa angered at Bones, insulted at his ""not into peddling flesh"" comment and defying her attempt to reason with him to keep the secret of her holding onto the body of Mulhall, causing him purposed pain to prove a point about how easy it'd be to harm him (that he should be on his knees worshipping at her feet). Henoch outsmarted by Sargon who he thinks is dead. The episode actually having Kirk dead (and later Spock), with Bones realizing this with startled astonishment. Shatner's performance as Kirk's body is taken over by Sargon for the first time, and that re-introduction to human flesh and blood providing great satisfaction, forgetting how great it feels. The love story between these god-like beings reliving yesterday at the present in these bodies which allows them to feel each other after so long. Kirk's speech about what Sargon could provide them in terms of its knowledge and superior intellect. Chapel (always smitten with Spock with her infatuation falling on deaf ears) getting to share her body with Spock's consciousness. All the chicanery by Henoch, often mocking Thalassa, as he plots to keep his Vulcan body and all its pleasantries. And on and on. It is an episode with lots going on, giving Shatner and Nimoy a real chance to go outside their comfort zones and do something different with their characters. That Kirk and Spock suffer technical deaths only to be spared thanks to the power of these beings which can inhabit even the Enterprise (!) produce some knockout moments.",8
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Return to Tomorrow (TV Episode 1968)",I suppose in a way it is a criticism.,"Could never figure out how a race who could preserve their consciousness in vessels for a half million years were not technologically advanced enough to build androids as sophisticated as those portrayed in the 3 episodes I Mudd, What Are Little Girls Made Of, and Requiem For Methuselah, granted it was like 30/35 yrs. later when Dr. Noonien Soong began creating androids, but even they possessed all 5 senses. It is obvious that Flint, Soong the race that created the androids that Dr. Roger Corby and those that Harcourt Fenton Mudd stumbled upon were more intelligent in Cybernetics able to design and build androids far more advanced than anything Sargon's people were capable of building. Guess they were not as advanced in every field as the writers of the episode tried to convince us of.",5
14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Return to Tomorrow (TV Episode 1968)",A little off.,"I was originally going to title this review as ""Worthy of Season Three"", with the implication that this episode of Season Two Trek is spartan in presentation, and has a lot of clichés aimed at Star Trek from onlookers who are not fans and fans alike. The music is canned, the episode takes place entirely within the ship (no location shots, not interior studio shots of other locations outside the ship), and the script is borderline vapid. This script needed some doctoring before being committed to film. The shortcomings; one of the myths created by asinine social psychologists in the 60s and 70s was that we only use ten or twenty percent of our minds. Completely false on every level. There was no bigger lie foisted on the public. The reason this is important to this episode is that the animal mind (in this case the human mind) is an integrated data storage and processing unit made up of a massive network of microprocessors. If you dump another data set into it at the mid-thirties or mid-forties age bracket, the person in question might not be able to function. But, it is science fiction, and no one new data storage and processing limits at that time. Still, there is a kind of psychological arrogance that pervades and reeks of this episode.The other aspect is that the episode needed a bit more pizazz or energy to make it sing. We're seeing a love triangle of sorts, or rather a competition between two males for the attentions of a female. One man wishes to keep his people thriving, the other is willing to do anything to win the female. It sounds like an interesting story premise, and it is, but again we're limited to the interiors of the ship and a proxy use of the characters by another set of characters that we only see as orbs with blinking lights.The acting carries the episode, but only far. In short the technological limits of both the production and the knowledge of the screenwriter, hold back what could have been a better episode. Nimoy does a superb job of portraying a very Machiavellian entity, and Shatner and the rest of the cast give excellent performances, but we're still stuck on the ship with characters that should have been both more cinematic and dynamic at the same time. The lack of SFX and the lack of locations couple with the already listed shortcomings to give us a very watered down version of a tale that should have been far more dynamic. If I had shot it I might have had Spock going around taking over the ship and sabotaging efforts to stop him, replete with special effects and exterior shots of the Enterprise. But, that'll have to wait for another time and another place.As it is it's a run in the mill episode. A sort of ""Oh, this one's one..."" installment of classic Star Trek.An episode that should have had more impact, but didn't. Oh well.",

They enter into a zone that has never been explored by humans nor anyone else. Sargon communicates telepathically and wants Kirk, Spock and Dr. Ann Mulhall to beam down... McCoy wants to join for medical interests and Kirk has 2 security guards on the transporter to join them when they beam down. Sargon does not allow the 2 security guards to beam down but allows McCoy to beam down. Sargon takes over Kirk's body and also wants Mulhall and Spock's bodies as well for his wife and friend so they all 3 can live again. They want to construct robots to but themselves in and need to be in physical form to do so - that is their need for the bodies. They do not want the ship's crew to do it because they do not have the knowledge to construct exactly the android bodies they want. Sargon leaves Kirk's body leaving him with some knowledge of who and what Sargon's kind are. Kirk and crew are given a choice to help or not... if they refuse to help they are free to leave. McCoy protests helping the aliens because of the danger involved but finally agrees to it. Now Kirk, Spock and Mulhall are suspended while the aliens take over their bodies to do what they must do in creating their new android bodies but they love being in a human form but there are medical complications involved all except Henoch in the Vulcan body. It is Henoch that is the ""evil"" one.Interesting concept for an episode. Spirits taking over the bodies of the 3 while the spirits or souls of Kirk, Spock and Mulhall are in a state of suspension.7.5/10",7
16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Return to Tomorrow (TV Episode 1968)",Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"In ""Return to Tomorrow"", the Enterprise encounters the remnants of an ultra-intelligent, long forgotten race who requires the crews' assistance. The 3 remaining aliens have taken on the form of pure energy to survive for half a million years; they want to borrow Kirk, Spock, and a female doctor named Ann Mulhall's bodies temporarily so that they can build themselves android shells and lead a semi-normal life. There are a few issues with this: 1) these lifeforms can only survive in human bodies for short periods of time without killing there surrogates; they come narrowly close to killing Kirk multiple times. 2) While the leader and his wife are cool, the third member named Henoch enjoys life in Spock's body and has plans on keeping it. To do this, he also plans on killing the Sargon the leader whilst Sargon is in Kirk's body, trapping Kirk's consciousness in a ball of energy.Luckily Sargon is able to outwit old Henoch and gets him to kill himself without harming Spock. Sargon realizes that the temptation of the flesh (in more ways than one) is too much for him and his wife after thousands of years and they agree to fade out in oblivion, leaving the Enterprise to continue its exploration.I thought this episode had a good idea going: ancient aliens needing humans as conduits to rebuild their society. In exchange, they would teach us their technology and wisdom. But as it turns out, these guys might not be as superior as they make themselves out to be. Their chief concern (besides Sargon) is maintaining their fleshy bodies. They all seem to have some pent-up sexual energy (and who could blame them?) and this allows them to wander into the temptation of trying to keep their human bodies.The episode is okay but there are a few issues with the script. Sargon's constant reference to the crew as his ""children"" never amount to anything. There's also no payoff as to why he says without his help, the human race will perish. I guess he means they need his wisdom but that's half-baked at best. Henoch's such a villain, he doesn't even try to hide it. Nimoy might as well be twirling his mustache!Anyways, a fairly forgettable episode with one exception: this was George Takei's first episode filmed since returning for Season 2. I look forward to more Sulu hijinks in the future!",6

Between wits impassioned delivery and the scene with Kirk being possessed, there's some nice Shatner overacting here.Outside of that, this is a pretty average episode offering a good story about ancient beings needing new bodies to live on.

19,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Return to Tomorrow (TV Episode 1968)",but he did fly..,"Star TrekReturn To TomorrowA cultural hub and by far one of the most loved and respected tale, Star Trek is created by Gene Roddenberry who wrote this brilliant concept, ahead of its time and is probably why it still doesn't fail to entertain us after these many years. It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. After a good run on its first season, the second season has more expectations to fulfill and hopefully they will try to develop the character a bit more and focus on the relations between the crew members on the enterprise to blend in and communicate easily with the audience despite of just focusing on more mind-numb missions that sometimes feel like they are filling their time and work in.Return To Tomorrow has a fresh concept that is supported well with gripping screenplay but the writing isn't as strong and lacks the essential crisp and the unpredictability that makers think it does which makes it more disappointing no matter how much entertaining.",
20,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Return to Tomorrow (TV Episode 1968)",A seminal episode,"Perhaps the most damning of all Star Trek critiques is the impossibility of sapient races originating on different worlds to mate and produce young. Yet the series opens with a vulcan/human hybrid (the inimitable Mr. Spock).In this episode, however, the character Sargon states that in his race's antiquity, many, many worlds were ""seeded"" (not his word) by denizens of his anthropomorphic genotype - similar to that of standard earth humans. This allows the possibility of similar DNA arising from many worlds that could be similar enough to fruitfully mate. It doesn't actually matter whether advanced forms of life survived on these planets, but the mere unavoidability of multi-cellular entities, and even strings of nucleotides being incorporated in the DNA of all creatures' genome at least allows for possibilities.",7
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Patterns of Force (TV Episode 1968)",Patterns of Seriousness,"This is the episode that somewhat undermines my theory that a lot of the cheesiness and campiness of the series was unintentional. Roddenberry and company get very serious in Patterns of Force, and understandably so--this is the episode about Nazism.Nazism is broached through a very common theme for the series--an alien culture has been corrupted by an outside force. In this case, as in many others, the outside force was a previous explorer from the Federation, one who chose to ignore the Prime Directive of non-influential interference.For most of the episode, Star Trek doesn't have anything very unprecedented to say about Nazism. It's a fairly literal presentation/examination, with a race from a neighboring planet serving as a barely veiled representation of Jews. Towards the end of the episode, however, there is a pretty controversial stance taken towards Nazism--it arrives in the justification for breaking the Prime Directive. Scripter John Meredyth Lucas and Roddenberry are clever enough to wrap their controversial point in an undermined character who is potentially interpretable as a villain for his decisions.But the reason this episode is so good and unusual isn't because it has profound things to say about Nazism. It's because it does a lot of typical Star Trek things--like Kirk and Spock being held captive, having to bluff their way out of jams, and so on--in a very unusual, very serious way. We usually have little worry that Kirk and Spock will be shortly out of a locked cell, but here, director Vincent McEveety films a very familiar scene so that it is very suspenseful. Likewise, Spock in incongruous disguises or modes often causes laughter, and frequently the threat of him being revealed when he needs to be disguised is just as promising of humor as tension. Here, there's nothing funny about it, it's instead nail-biting. With laudable help from the make-up department, McEveety also manages to truly make Spock feel alien. Even Shatner gives a serious, intense performance rather than hamming it up this time around, and the same goes for DeForest Kelley. In fact, McEveety so successfully achieves a weighty mood that even the typical, somewhat comical bickering between Spock and McCoy takes on an edge of nastiness in the final scene.I love Star Trek's normal campiness and cheesiness, but Patterns of Force goes to show that it's just as excellent when they try to keep everything on the straight and narrow.",10
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Patterns of Force (TV Episode 1968)","Strong Entry, Based on Ludicrous Premise","The Enterprise is approaching two inhabited planets, Ekos and Zaos, hoping to find out what happened to Anthropological Historian John Gill (David Brian). Kirk is a former student of Gill's and Spock is duly impressed by Mr. Hill's teachings, but nobody has heard from him for a long time. A nuclear warhead is the Enterprise's welcoming committee, and the ship fairly quickly comes to understand that Gill has become involved in the creation of a cultural duplication of Nazi Germany on Ekos. So, the conflict seems to hinge on TOS' most powerful self-created cliché  Morality and the prime directive.This background is very pithily crammed into the five minute opening sequence. The episode proceeds somewhat more leisurely afterward, but remains, essentially, an action/adventure story. Kirk and Spock are captured and have to escape, as usual, but the plot does involve a couple of nicely executed twists. The support cast deserves special mention here. This episode could not have been as successful as it was without really nice performances by Richard Evans, David Brian, the mysteriously MIA Valora Noland (not seen in film since 1971), and Skip Homeier. The sets are also excellent and very convincing.There are a couple of troubling and interesting points that this episode, whether intentionally or not, raises. Aside from the usual clichés about absolute power corrupting absolutely, etc, the episode praises Naziism for its efficiency (a compliment somewhat at odds with the real economic and political history of Nazi Germany) and seems to suggest that in the hands of a benevolent dictator, totalitarianism isn't necessarily a bad thing. Also, I wasn't sure whether to be amused or disturbed by the fact that the most Aryan looking actor in the entire cast  by far  Skip Homeier  was cast in the role of the of a scheming, manipulative, sociopath. I am not sure what statement, if any, this was intended, but it certainly was affective. Homeier's performance is very memorable.All considered, this is a memorable episode for its difficult and intelligently handled subject matter, strong acting and sets. The script and directing are sort of average for TOS, but nevertheless adequate. Director McEveety would later make a name for himself with the TV show Dallas.",7
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Patterns of Force (TV Episode 1968)",Kirk and Spock vs. the Nazis,"Following on the heels of ""A Private Little War,"" this is another serious stab at presenting the dire consequences of interfering with the natural progression of a culture. This time, the contamination is Nazism, a plague of thought / speech spread on a planet called Ekos. The Ekosians, a warlike primitive people, are subverted to channel their aggression against their peaceful neighboring planet, Zeon. The Zeons were more advanced up until a few years ago; but now, Ekos has the same technology and plans are made to exterminate the Zeons. It all started innocently enough. It's a bit strange. The Federation has had this non-interference directive, the Prime Directive, in place for at least a century or more. I understand a sometime aggressive hotshot like Kirk rationalizing around this directive at times of intense situational imperative, but now an elderly Federation historian, a supposed expert on what tampering with history means, decides to re-arrange a culture's status quo on what appears to be a whim - a chance to play God, as McCoy puts it.The main problem with episodes such as this has to do with constraints related to budget, make-up and so forth. The show is unable to capture the atmosphere of an actual alien planet or culture. Rather, it appears as if Kirk and Spock have transported themselves into Earth's past yet again, to Europe during World War II when it was dominated by Nazi Germany. There is no make-up involved for the supposed two alien races here; they are, for all practical purposes, other humans. The Ekosians are the Nazis here, where-as the Zeons are stand-ins for the persecuted Jews. The episode does succeed in capturing some of that brutality associated with the Nazi regime and there's plenty of suspense as Kirk & Spock attempt to infiltrate the Nazi HQ to see their Federation rep, now Fuhrer. If anything, this is the serious version of ""A Piece of the Action"" - the scary contemplation of how an entire society can be deluded into following a certain doctrine. But, did we need a sf version of actual history to get the point across? The most intriguing aspect is Melakon, the deputy Fuhrer who is, in fact, the actual incarnation of Hitler or Himmler - take your pick.",7
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Patterns of Force (TV Episode 1968)",Star Trek 'Patterns of Force' use of Nazi terminology,"The Star Trek study of how Nazis happened was just on G4TV. The show's use of terminology is skillful and usually meant to disguise something not exactly tasteful for 1960's TV. Like the ""Komms"" vs. ""Yangs"" in one other episode which were yoofamisms for Communists vs. Yanks. This episode was about ""Zayans"" vs. ""Ekosians"". The Zayans, the Jews, is obviously a reference to ""Zion"", but can anyone help with how ""Ekosians"" refers to Aryans, Germans, etc.?? Oh, by the way, Star Trek isn't like any of 'the other 1960's sci-fi shows' such as Voyage to Bottom of the Sea, Time Tunnel, or anything else. It was beyond television, beyond pop culture, and would be ahead of its time by a few centuries if it came out today.",9
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Patterns of Force (TV Episode 1968)",The usual Star Trek 'Why?',"I enjoyed this episode but throughout I was distracted by the usual Star Trek question 'Why?'For instance, Kirk and Spock beam down to face the unknown (like in most episodes) yet THIS time Kirk order transponders to be injected into the skin and to be beamed up automatically if they lose their communicators and do not answer after 3 hours.Are you ready?...... WHY don't they do that all the time? How many episodes had them losing their communicators and not being able to beam up when that would have been a very good thing to do?Also, Kirk cut out the transponders from their arms using a bed spring and attached them to the spring in order to cut their way out of the cell. But then they throw the spring AND the transponders away, before steeling themselves to fight their way through many guards to reach the Fuhrer.Are you ready?........WHY didn't they keep the transponders, beam up, quickly get their wounds cleaned , then beam down into the Fuhrers office,thereby bypassing all the guards?I know, I'm picky aren't I.",
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Patterns of Force (TV Episode 1968)","With a historical error at its core, not one of the better episodes","This is, arguably, the most disappointing of Second Season episodes. Not only for its poor execution and bad special effects (see the ridiculous flogging ""wounds"" on Spock's and Kirk's backs), but for the flaw at the heart of the story.Also naming the victims of the Ekosian Nazi's ""Zeons"" (as in Zion, a Jewish term for Israel) could hardly be more transparent. Star Trek fans don't need road signs telling them who the players are supposed to be.But it's just a mediocre episode, not even relieved by the usual verbal sparing between Spock and McCoy. With an episode this silly, there better be some really good comic relief to make it tolerable. But there's no spoonful of sugar for this medicine--and it goes down hard.It's even more annoying that this was the second use of ""Hodgkins' Law of Parallel Development"" in the same four episode run (see ""The Omega Glory"", Episode 2.23, where the ""Enterprise"" encounters a post-apocalyptic planet whose inhabitants not only speak English, but carry the American flag, have a copy of the Constitution, recite the Pledge of Allegiance and call themselves ""Yangs"" (""Yanks""); while their enemies are called ""Kohms"", as in ""Communists."" Roddenberry uses the same device for a THIRD time in the season finale, ""Bread and Circuses"" (Episode 2.25) where an exact duplicate of Imperial Rome has survived 2000 years to develop Twentieth Century technology (i.e. machine guns and swords).""The Omega Glory"" is about on the same quality level as this episode. ""Bread and Circuses"" is much better. This plot device wears thin quickly--much as Time Travel was beaten to death in TNG, DS9 and even Voyager and three of thee ten movies. ""Bread and Circuses"" would have been believable by itself, but the other two just aren't up to par; as a result all three look like the product of desperation to meet ""air dates."" Indeed, a constant theme in the extras about the show's production was how often they came to missing those dates! These shows have the feeling of ""quickie"" scripts, slapped together in order to deliver the required 25 episodes to NBC.""Bread and Circuses"", at least, features character development and an interesting religious development that perplexes Kirk & Co. The first two episodes are just excuses to show off Spock's usual cleverness MacGyver-style: he uses the ""transponders"" implanted in his and Kirk's arm to create a primitive ""laser"" powered by a light-bulb (!) to cut through the lock on their cell door. Shatner (and his stunt double(s) are given an excuse to show that he's Macho Man and kicks bad guy behind with his usual relish. BORING.I almost have the feeling I can hear a big sigh of relief at the time bought by these truncated, half-written scripts for the perennially over-worked, over-budget, behind-schedule crew and cast.When Kirk is finally able to confront Prof. John Gill about why he chose to infuse Ekosian culture with National Socialism, Gill calls the Nazi regime, ""The most efficient in history..."" This is flat-out wrong. Nazi Germany was terribly, purposefully inefficient. In order to ensure that absolute control remained in his hands, Hitler encouraged inefficiency, overlapping authority between agencies, built his own personal army that rivaled the regular Wehrmacht, and fostered rivalries among his inner circle (Goering, Himmler, Bormann, et al).He also used every excuse he could to centralize military command ever more tightly into his hands. He blackmailed, framed, and bullied the generals he inherited from the Weimar Reichswehr until he was ""commanding"" armies hundreds of miles away as though he were on the spot. German troops suffered as much from his arrogance and stupidity as they did from Soviet and Allied military action.A further demonstration of wild inefficiency was the existence of TWELVE separate foreign intelligence gathering agencies. Naturally, the intelligence gathered was often contradictory.Despite the use of the most brutal methods imaginable, the Nazis were never able to stamp out resistance movements inside Germany (as the three known attempts on Hitler's life demonstrate), let alone in conquered nations such as France, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.Hitler twisted the Germany economy toward one purpose: a quick conquest of Europe and the Soviet Union, a goal quite beyond Germany's capacity--especially once the US was involved. Like Napoleon, Hitler depended upon plundering his conquered victims to fund, fuel and feed his war machine.Hardly what one would call a paragon of efficiency.",5
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Patterns of Force (TV Episode 1968)",Space Nazis!,"When I was younger and first saw this episode I was watching a lot of ""Hogan's Heroes"", catching ""Tobruk"" and ""Guns of Navvarone"" every now and then, and a number of other films and TV shows that had Nazis as the bad guy dujour. I drew American tanks and planes and all other manner of things kicking the crap out of Nazi this and Nazi that. Cool huh? And when you see Kirk and crew take on the space Nazis, it just drives home the point that much more.""Patterns of Force"" explores the notion that fascism itself was not the lead cause of the diabolical industrialized slaughter of a people that had done nothing but to help a weakened Germany develop. It offers to the audience that it was not the leadership of the national socialist party that lead them to murderous policies, but the centralization of power that could not be checked nor questioned by anyone. True.The episode parallels the formula that lead Germany to war under the Nazi regime, and also parallels the policy of mass killing of the Zaeons by the Ekosian military leadership. The episode suggests that under the proper leadership things could get done, and for the benefit of all, but, when the wrong leadership gets into power, even those who are benign but are surrounded by ""self seeking adventurers"" like Melakon (probably a sociopath), things go awry, and common people, people who are too busy putting bread on the table to think about national policy, will blindly follow that twisting of leadership.True, but under the condition that the people in question know not enough to question the leadership's roles and policies. But, that's what the ceremony of the Nazi regime is designed to do; unify the super- majority of the masses into a cohesive unit that trumps and dominates all.Kirk reminds the characters and professor who and what the Nazis were, and where he doesn't destroy the Nazi regime, he helps remove the cancer within, and steer a totalitarian state towards a more moderate existence. Good? I have my doubts, but there's only so much a starship captain can do.Me, I'm a little tired of hearing about Nazis in movies, TV shows, comic books, radio, novels and even on the net. My personal commentary is that maybe we should move beyond obsessing about Nazis, and learn to avoid unchecked power structures. I think that was missed in this episode of Trek, for even though Kirk sets things aright, things could go wrong once again. But, is that a result of the power structure or the power base? Is is the supporters who fail to check their own social order to correct and remove malefactors, or is it really an unsolvable problem with that kind of social regime?Me, I really don't care to dedicate too many brain cells to the problem, but, needless to say, Kirk and Spock have yet to come across a corrupt parallel of the United States of America (""The Omega Glory"" not withstanding). Well acted, so-so typical 1960's era Trek SFX, some outstanding thesping (as usual from the series), with a great plot but iffy execution. I'm tempted to call it hackneyed because of the use of Nazis, but that's the 2013 person speaking here, and not the younger 1968 viewer.Give it a shot.",
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Patterns of Force (TV Episode 1968)",Breathtaking Lead Performances,"Science fiction is usually about the present or the recent past. Fanciful new technologies are used, and mis-used, just as real ones have been exploited in the real world, setting up moral paradigms for our heroes to resolve correctly this time. Setting a story on some alien world and changing the names of the players usually doesn't hide the underlying message to anyone mindful of the historical parallels.""Patterns of Force"" follows in this tradition, though it takes the somewhat unusual route of transplanting real situations of Earth's past to the requisite alien world. Skirting the risk of taking the easy route and simply condemning the unredeemable, making the lesson a bit too didactic, the episode instead veers in another direction entirely and becomes a wonderful critique and examination of enduring human nature and frailty.The Starship Enterprise, lead by the redoubtable Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), is looking for lost historian John Gill (a barely-there David Brian) when it is fired upon by a missile from a planet that shouldn't have that capability. Kirk and his Vulcan sidekick Spock (Leonard Nimoy) beam down to investigate. In rapid sequence, they find out that the planet is controlled by real, honest-to-goodness Nazis, are captured and almost killed, and then find themselves in cahoots with an active resistance movement.So, we have the set-up, that this is going to be an examination of bad, bad Naziism, right? Well, perhaps, but that is not the episode's real target. Wisely taking the brutality and illogic of Naziism for granted, instead, our heroes use that system's inherent weakness against it as they retain focus and search for the lost Gill.Valora Noland, born the day after Pearl Harbor to parents who had fled Wiesbaden after Kristalnacht, and named after a speech by Winston Churchill, reportedly (understandably) hated playing a Nazi figure. However, she is the episode's blazing star. She plays Daras, a Nazi propaganda hero. However, is she really a Nazi, or something else? That answer is provided quickly, and emphatically, and thereafter Daras becomes more of a meditation on the media than anything political. Watch her preen as Kirk holds a camera in her face, and flounce up the stairs of the Nazi headquarters as if going up the red carpet at the Academy Awards (almost an inside joke there, I think). Valora knew how to act with her eyes, watch them closely throughout for some real emoting. Some may decry the lack of facial prosthetics and so forth (so painfully over-used in later incarnations of the series) to make the aliens look ""different."" However, this supposed negative turns into a major asset when it permits you to experience the emotions flitting across Valora's face as she first holds a gun on Kirk, then abruptly and surprisingly turns and fires at someone else. Strong females on Star Trek seldom fared well in the final analysis, but Daras defies that peril against all odds. A fabulous role played fabulously.A fascinating aspect is the casual, almost backhanded slap taken at the reality of Naziism. For instance, the Nazis are shown to be infiltrated with the very people they were persecuting. Many real Nazis had, for example, Jewish origins, including perhaps Hitler himself, and they wasted a great deal of time investigating or justifying each others' phantom racial purity. This subtly supports the series' recurring message that we are all morally interchangeable and thus responsible for our moral choices. The absurd use of physiognomy to categorize and denigrate is completely sent up when arch-villain Malakon (Skip Homeier, in one of his several awesome guest star turns in the original series) pompously derides the smartest man on the planet (Spock) for his ""low forehead, denoting stupidity."" But the target is much wider than simply an indefensible political system and its self-serving justifications. The ending takes a sharp jab at modern media in general as being simply a tool to be mis-used even with the best of intentions. Daras is hailed for the cameras as a great hero (again) despite the fact that everyone in the room knows that she indeed may be a hero, but certainly not for the reasons the media will state.The episode is about Nazis, yes, but that is just the launching pad for the real insights. Everyone in the cast gives a rousing performance, and I wouldn't be surprised if they felt something personal about the entire experience. This wasn't the only time TOS Star Trek mentioned Nazis (see ""The City on the Edge of Forever,"") and its treatment of them is extremely honest and, dare I say it, even-handed as a sort of aberration that somehow crept out of the Id's cage. Some will decry this episode as politically incorrect and the notion that anyone at any time could fancy Naziism as ""efficient"" as completely insane, but it certainly is possible that some future (and possibly wacky or senile, we learn absolutely nothing about the man) historian could completely misread history. And that reveals another point to this tale, the danger of misreading history from a distant vantage point. Never forget.... Human nature and enduring reality is the larger target, one that is hit dead center by a stellar cast and script.",10

As they approach the planet they are surprised when a nuclear missile is fired at them; the people of Ekos are known to be war-like but their technology shouldn't be anywhere near that advanced, even the more advanced but peaceful neighbouring planet of Zeon doesn't have the ability to make such devices. Kirk and Spock beam down to Ekos and make a startling discovery; their society is clearly modelled on that of 1930s Germany; right down to the uniforms and insignia as well as the xenophobia, this time aimed at Zeonian members of society. They have an even bigger shock when they learn that the Führer of this world is none other than John Gill. Wearing stolen uniforms they attempt to get to Gill but are soon captured and tortured. They manage to escape with a Zeonian who is a member of the resistance. With the help of a resistance that includes a noted member of the Nazi party working to bring the party down from the inside. As they get close to the Führer they learn of the Nazi's proposed 'Final Solution' to the Zeonians.This is one of the classic episodes of Star Trek, like the mob themed 'A Piece of the Action' it is based on an alien society that has deliberately copied part of Earth history. This time it turns out the changes have been deliberately made by Gill who thought he could use the Nazi's efficiency but neglected to curb its darker elements. Some of the parallels to 1930s Germany are a bit too obvious; if uniforms and xenophobia weren't enough the subjugated people's role as the Jews in this tragedy are from Zeon (Zion) and they even have Jewish sounding names I doubt many viewers would have missed the parallels without them being driven home so hard. Despite the lack of subtlety this is a fun episode; the bad guys are genuinely bad and our protagonists undergo torture rather than just getting into danger. It is also entertaining to see Kirk, Spock and McCoy dressed in Nazi uniforms; uniforms that once brought terror to millions now seem surprisingly camp. The regular cast all perform well and guest star Valora Noland is great a 'good Nazi' Doras. The final resolution is a bit weak; as soon as the main villain is exposed everybody seems to give up their Nazi views instantly. Overall though this is pretty good episode; definitely one you'll remember.",8

Not only because of the great acting, character interaction, a rather believable premise, don't get me wrong; those do contribute. But this episodes strongest factor is that it's a poignant, accurate and strong testament to one of the darkest, most infamous chapters of human history: the Nazi regime.Here's the story: kirk & spock beam down to Ekos to find a federation historian kirk once knew. They beam down straight into the arrest of Issak, from the neighboring planet Zeon. It seems that kirk's old mentor has implemented a Nazi regime identical to the one of our past, only their bent on wiping out zeons, instead of Jews. No disguise there, but isn't that the point? Once arrested, they break free and take Issak with them to find the underground (and an explanation). Long story short: the federation historian, though responsible for the uniforms and stuff, wasn't responsible for all the bigotry and destruction of the party on that planet. He manages to call off the attack and things go back to the way they were, with perhaps a new acceptance of differing views and cultures. Some final thoughts for you to chew on that are well shown in this episode: ""we must never forget or it will happen again"" and:""even historians, fail to learn from history.""",

He had intentions of being a benevolent Fuehrer, but some very ambitious underlings led by Skip Homeier turn the Nazi movement on their planet of Ekos to what it resembled on Earth. They're also more powerful than what they were on Earth as witness by the fact that the Enterprise is attacked with hydrogen bomb missile.That's a taste of what the Ekotians plan to do to their neighboring planet of Zaon. Zaon hating and scapegoating is the favorite past time of the Nazis of Ekos.After that attack and seeing how the Prime Directive has been violated the mission and the duty of the Enterprise is clear.

11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Patterns of Force (TV Episode 1968)","""You should make a very convincing Nazi""!","This is probably the most overtly political Star Trek episode, wearing it's anti-Nazi theme boldly on the sleeves of those German officer uniforms. Not much is left to the imagination regarding historical analogies, as the Ekosians as presented are the ultimate anti Zeon-ists, inspired by a former Federation cultural representative who wound up violating the Noninterference Directive. Funny, this was the second mention in the series' run as the ND, (#2.17 - 'A Piece of the Action' was the first), and I've got my ears peeled for it's initial description as the Prime Directive.An interesting takeaway for me in the early going was Spock's observation of Professor Gill's (David Brian) method of history, directed at causes and motivations rather than a dry reading of dates and events. The 'causes and motivations' idea led me to consider how liberal writers and analysts of present day use America's history as pretext for claiming why terrorist nations hate and want to destroy us - presumably because we're the bad guys. You can buy that argument if you want, but it makes no sense at all. Present day bad guys, like the Ekosians, are evil because they want to instill their ideology on the rest of the world, destroying anyone or anything that stands in their way.With frequent use of terms like Fuhrer and Fatherland, the story leaves little to the imagination regarding Roddenberry's analysis of Nazi attempts to exterminate the Jews (anti-Zeon/Zion). Where the story gets murky is the ease with which various Ekosian revolutionaries managed to infiltrate the party hierarchy. One wonders how far they might have gotten had Kirk and Spock not appeared on the scene. Certainly John Gill would never have been revealed for his Earth origins, and Deputy Fuhrer Melakon (Skip Homeier) would have eventually achieved supremacy. Consider the Enterprise intervention a reminder of America's entry into World War II, assuring the defeat of Nazi Germany and it's Axis allies. The troubling aspect of this episode however, is the idea that history doesn't learn from it's mistakes of the past, as all one needs to do is observe the ascendancy of tyrannical regimes around the world today, while inattentive nations make the same mistakes in dealing with them all over again.",7
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Patterns of Force (TV Episode 1968)","Dark Subject, Classic Trek, Even With Punches Pulled","As a boy I rated this as one of my favorite TREK episodes, just because there's plenty of action, lots of gun play and because Kirk genuinely does make (in Spock's words) ""a very convincing Nazi."" Interestingly, when I began to recreate my Star Trek collection on video, twenty years later, I found that PATTERNS did not live up to my memories. I think part of the problem is that the treatment of Nazism is meant to be challenging and serious but actually pulls some punches.Several reviewers correctly pointed out that the real Nazi Germany was in fact NOT ""the most efficient state earth ever knew."" But the differences between the ""real"" Nazi Germany and Professor Gill's Ecosian variety are also interesting. The horror of the real Holocaust is toned down in several ways.1.) The Zeons have a planet of their own, and presumably could always find some way to hide and/or fight back in an emergency, (such as an extraterrestrial invasion) however ""peaceful"" they might be.2.) The Zeons we meet on this planet, Isok, Abram, and the rest, are all openly militant, determined to fight back, well organized, and completely un-intimidated by Brown Shirts and SS. There's not even a hint of passivity, terror, or a state of denial comparable to what crippled Europe's Jewish population with such tragic results. (i.e. ""this too will pass, they can't be serious, they really need us."") 3.) The anti-Nazi resistance in Germany was pathetically ineffectual (with apologies to the brave Von Stauffenberg.) But the story line here softens the historical truth. It seems the Ecosian Nazi party is riddled with resistance members, double agents, and free spirits of all types. One minute it's lovely Dara who's switching sides, and the next thing you know Party Chairman Enig is ""one of us"" too. Kirk and Spock could have stayed on the Enterprise and ""phoned it in"" if they had known defeating the Nazi menace would be this easy! 4.) Given that there are plenty of heroic Zeons and noble Ecosians to do the heavy lifting, it's a real shame Kirk couldn't have had a love scene or two with Dara, the ultimate Kitten With A Whip. Come to think of it, if SHE had been in charge of the ""whipping"" scene this episode would have definitely broken new ground!",8

I was born in 1961, so I was quite young when this was on. However, I immediately fell madly in love with Spock.Today, now being an adult, I really appreciate this episode even more with Spock running around without a shirt on. Mmmm he is so handsome. All that wonderful chest hair.Now to the actual episode: I liked how they explored how it isn't necessarily just a particular person that is the cause of an entire society getting to the point of wanting to stay separated from other groups, even to the point of wanting to kill anyone that is not the same, but that it takes a situation where the entire power structure has nothing to keep it in check. They were given carte blanche and this allowed the whole thing to get completely out of control. There could have been a lot of good to come from the setup of the type of government that Gill was trying to accomplish. But, he had people that had other ideas that were in power with him. The citizenry was too easily persuaded to go along with this madness and the whole thing got out of hand.Spock and Kirk were finally able to get access to Gill. They find out that Gill was just trying to unite a divided planet. If it had all been kept benign as he intended, it would have worked, but his second in command (Melakon) was power hungry. He drugged Gill and took over and perverted the plan for his own ambitions. They were finally able to get Gill alert enough to let people know the true message of what he was trying to do and Melakon was killed. Both peoples were now going to be able to work together and would try to find ways for both cultures to live in harmony.The very end was quite amusing. The banter between Spock and Bones was great.

It's quite efficient for the powerful, but, as usual, there has to be a scapegoat. This is a peaceful civilization which becomes the target of the final solution. There are so many things that make one's eyes pop in this episode. For one thing, the Nazi's are an intercontinental organization (stock footage of thousands greeting the Nazi leadership). Yet, Kirk and Spock beam down, are picked up by a single soldier, and demand to see the Fuhrer (who just happens to be around). Eventually, the get hooked up with an underground movement and use them to infiltrate the headquarters. Even more amazing is that Gill has been drugged and his body propped up in a chair, a microphone concealing his mouth. He supposedly is the source of the usual hate talk.

The crew, upon discovering this hell, know it is incumbent upon them to put things right and stop the madness! Only on Star Trek would you have seen an episode where a Nazi planet would be encountered! This isn't really a huge criticism, but obviously this sort of ultra-fanciful episode could never have appeared on most other sci-fi series that were more attempting to give a more ""realistic"" view of the future.

One is more technologically advanced and peaceful. The other is more crude and prone to violence. When the Enterprise arrives, it has found the primitive race has taken on the role of oppressors. The Ekosians have somehow learned about the Nazi party and have used its ideology to control and slaughter then peaceful Zeons. The Federation's historian John Gill is now serving as the Ekosians' leader in this genocide. Kirk and Spock must head down and figure out what has happened to Gill and this society. They need to figure out a way to reverse the current path.As it turns out, teaching brimming societies about the efficiencies of WWII-era Germany doesn't work out as planned. Gill's message is perverted by his second-in-command who drugs Gill and uses him like a puppet. This new despot embraces Nazism to the extreme and begins to systematically capture and kill the Zeons. Spock and Kirk disguise themselves as officers to infiltrate the party and find Gill. They run across a group of rebels who help them. In the end, they snap Gill out of it for long enough that he spills the beans. Both Gill and his second-in-command are killed in the melee and the two races are left to pick up the pieces of their now ruined society.Sometimes I think Kirk makes dumb decisions when dealing with interference on an evolving planet but Gill might be as dumb as they come. Why would he ever think mirroring a culture with two distinct races (one peaceful and one violent) after Nazi-era Germany would be a good idea? Of course it went sour! Leave to the Federation to come into a planet and muck things up!The amount of times Spock's ears have gotten him and Kirk in trouble is absolutely comical. They keep ending up on these humanoid planets with no notable differences from Earthlings. Spock sticks out like a sour thumb.While this episode's plot is okay once you get into it, it's the getting into it part that's difficult. I'm growing tiresome of these aliens that have zero distinguishing characteristics from humans. I know money is tight but come on guys, maybe just a few blue dots on the forehead or something? Anything! Also, the entire premise of a historian doing this is laughable (as I've mentioned above). Despite this, the plot moves along at a good pace and we get to see TOS's take on Nazism in the modern age.Note: Chronologically, this isn't the Enterprise's first run-in with Nazis.

The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. After a good run on its first season, the second season has more expectations to fulfill and hopefully they will try to develop the character a bit more and focus on the relations between the crew members on the enterprise to blend in and communicate easily with the audience despite of just focusing on more mind-numb missions that sometimes feel like they are filling their time and work in.Patterns Of Force is another one of their political episode where our heroes meddles between some planet's war and saves it which is something they have tried multiple times and is wearing off now even though there aren't any mind-numbing action sequences.",

But Gill brings the Nazi ""efficiency"" to the Ekosians, hoping to perhaps stabilize them, but soon the power of his position as this outside influence and intellect corrupts him, with a second in command, Melakon (Skip Homeier), taking advantage, slipping him a drug until he's a puppet to use in order to further the cause of this ""Nazi regime"". The Zeons are to be exterminated by the Melakon-led Ekosian regime, not what Gill envisioned before being drugged into a stupor. It takes major McCoy hypo-injecting and the Kirk face slap(s) to sort of awaken Gill enough to spirit the Ekosians out of their kill-mode and focus on how Melakon muddied the waters of the real intentions. Seeing Spock and Kirk in Nazi garb is surreal, but the laser prison escape by Spock was neat, even if having to stand on the whipped back of Kirk (who, like Spock, had to take some whips to the back from one of Melakon's Nazi interrogators). Richard Evans as Zeon underground prisoner of war, Isak, and Valora Noland as Zeon spy, Daras, really contributes to the episode, bringing the integrity and dignity that exists in those who defy sadistic ideology, resistant towards those who attempt to use ""patterns of force"" in order to gain power and rule a world. The script pushes as close as it can on a television show, with machine gun fire assassinating one leader, and a pistol eliminating another.

Guess we know where these Kelvans stand, don't we? Or, perhaps not. For, they have taken human form. Actual Kelvans are 'immense beings' with a hundred tentacles. Such beings would have problems with a turbolift (and sixties FX would have problems depicting them). So, hearkening back to the aliens of ""Catspaw"" and ""Return to Tomorrow,"" these Kelvans have set themselves up for major seduction trouble by assuming our treacherous human form. And, strictly speaking, they're not invaders, merely an expedition force on its way back to the Andromeda Galaxy, where radiation levels will make life impossible there in about 10,000 years. Once back home, they'll tell the rest of the Kelvans to go ahead and proceed to our Milky Way galaxy and then conquer the hell out of it. But, the Federation would have no immediate worries; the invasion force probably won't arrive for at least 600 years (the round trip). If they ever create a Trek show set in the 29th century (or even the 26th), there's at least one story arc ready to be used.So, I'm not sure why Kirk and his officers were so worked up. Of course, their personal situation was a bit grim: the prospect of being stuck on the Enterprise for the rest of their lives as it hurtles towards Andromeda is kind of a downer. Though there are only half-a-dozen of these Kelvans, they easily take over the ship with their paralysis field weapons. They also modify the ship's engines. We're back at the galactic barrier first seen in the 2nd pilot episode, ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" - and through it. Then most the crew are turned into small weightless tetrahedron-like blocks. When I first saw this as a kid, a genuine chill ran thru me when one these blocks was crushed to dust, thereby killing a crew member in a rather horrifying manner. This was super-science employed as a war tactic, as an instrument of terror. This was alien invasion thrills and chills, no doubt, and these Kelvans seemed a step up from the usual baddies encountered on the original show (Klingons, Romulans, etc).But then, as was customary with many episodes after the first season, a grim tone changes to a playful one in the 2nd half of the episode. Then we get games of seduction and inebriation, of Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Scotty using their wits rather than their brawn, though in a manner befitting a Marx Brothers comedy instead of a sf adventure. It's still entertaining, sure, but I would have preferred some payback for that first half of terror, and the episode is rather uneven as a result of the precious ploys. The sugary ending is so cloying, so convenient, I usually need a shot of Scotch to get rid of the taste. On the plus side, Kelinda (Bouchet) is probably the sexiest alien we see on the original show and Kirk's super-stud status was assured with this episode. Scotty has the best scenes - it's green, indeed - and rumors of his alcoholism might have started here. And those images of the Enterprise zooming towards another galaxy stay in the mind for awhile.

Surely this is amplified by the fact that the aliens can zap humans into little, brainy sugar cubes. But it also helps that the writers made the aliens hail from another galaxy--it makes them more exotic and in the context of the series to date, unpredictable.As doomy as it gets, however, this episode isn't without an enjoyable sense of humor, and most admirably, Scotty gets a longer turn in the spotlight, as we learn what we've always suspected--no matter who you put up against him, he can drink them under the table.Kirk's love interest is also a source of humor on many levels, including when you keep in mind what Spock said about the aliens' true physical nature. On the other hand, when you look at her in her ""disguised"" form, courtesy of actress Barbara Bouchet, she was some knock-out--one of the best in the whole series, so I'd gladly forget about the tentacles, too.It's good to see Kirk not always easily triumph, and he's in a quagmire he almost can't bluff his way out of here.

4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" By Any Other Name (TV Episode 1968)",Star Trek: The Original Series - By Any Other Name,"The Enterprise follows a distress signal to a spacious, colorful planet, encountering ""Kelvins"", a type of species inhabiting humanoid bodies but adapting to them awkwardly. The Kelvins have this paralyzing device that renders those they target ""frozen in place"". The device even can turn those they target into cube-like blocks (they call it a ""neutralizing process""), easy to crush (the only time a Yeoman woman suffers the curse of the redshirt beam down, the one chosen to die). Kirk must watch her die, holding the crushed powder remnants in his agonizing hands, while his other redshirt (an African American man) is spared. Those devices are how Kirk sees them (Spock and McCoy) getting any advantage whatsoever. The leader of the Kelvins, Rojan (Warren Stevens, a recognizable face in 60s television, as well as, The Forbidden Planet) tells Kirk to accept that his crew (and the human race) are defeated, conquered, but the captain won't just accept that without a fight. It will take using their intellect to manipulate the situation, clued in by Spock when he notices that one of the Kelvins is interested and stimulated by food consumption. Soon Kirk has Scotty introduce the Kelvin to liquor! Meanwhile, Kirk gradually seduces female Kelvin, Kelinda (giallo goddess Barbara Bouchet), which makes Rojan jealous and eventually confrontational. The whole point is forcing the awareness of the emerging human emotion to be recognized by the Kelvins as they journey to Andromeda to meet back with their own species. If the Kelvins are too human, their own kind will not accept them upon return. Another Kelvin, Hanar (Steward Moss), is getting injections by McCoy to ""help his body function properly"", but it ultimately is just so he is troubled enough to be a hindrance to Rojan. Despite a horrible death that Kirk couldn't stop (Rojan tells Kirk, you will now watch your ""non essential personnel"" die), and watching his crew onboard the Enterprise reduced to chalk cubes, the episode is actually light-hearted in tone as it goes along. Seeing Kirk, Spock, Scotty, and McCoy capitalize on the ""human factor"" of the aliens with devices that place them always in disadvantage, once again having to use their wits to outsmart seemingly superior adversaries. Bouchet is just wow, quite a woman. Stevens is robotic, to start, with more human traits, through responses that surprise even him (his inquisitive expressions after feelings emerge), arising as Kirk makes a move for his woman. The Enterprise full of cubes (seeing Uhura and Chekov reduced on the Bridge, especially painful) and how Kirk aches at the situation is some of Shatner's best work as the character. The way he conveys the loss of his Yeoman (Julie Cobb) proves just how excruciating it can be to the captain of the Enterprise. Spock's chess game with Rojan, and how Kirk and Kelinda were ""meeting up"" elsewhere is most amusing. Within the series, this episode isn't one of the standard bearers, but it has its moments. That opening scene, where Rojan addresses Kirk, paralyzed, and his away team, really shows how helpless it can be when encountering lifeforms with ""tricks up their sleeve"".",7

It's Green....,"Scotties line when asked by the alien what the fourth bottle of booze was, drunkenly says after sniffing it, ""Well, it's green!"" Thats classic! An average overall Trek episode, thats not a put down because an average rating to me means very good compared to other sci fi shows which seem to be very very dull. Another reviewer here (I am assuming a young or somewhat young one), slams this episode for too much Scottie, excuse me? You are joking correct? The scene with Scottie getting the alien drunk under the table is all time best Trek material. Hello, this was made in the 60's.... miniskirts are worn by the female crew, Kirk is tagging as@ throughout the galaxy.... and Scottie has some booze stashed onboard without the preaching of a ex junkie liberal bartender (as in STTNG) to make you make you feel guilty that you want to kick some alien as@! This is what sets TOS apart from all the rest, its that they could GET away with it! And lets look at that Scottie point anyway, the ship was a DRY ship, just like a modern day US Navy ship is (McCoy had some booze just like a US Navy ship (1960-1980's) had for a pick me up shot if you fell overboard (saw a guy that got one), they don't even have that anymore). I love that TOS took the concept that these were starSHIPS, mostly because I am a Navy vet, but I mean not to stir up inter-service stuff, but if this was like a Army/Air Force gig, it wouldn't hold the charm of these rouge personalities like a Scottie in my humble opinion. Shore leave with the Army or Air Force, boring, lets go Navy! Anyway, this episode is cool, they kill the redshirt crewman in the beginning and they didn't pick the black male but the white female, I thought that was genius writing. Putting the black male (who had a few lines also, kudos's) in that role was awesome but hey, that was late 60's TV, Trek was very supportive of minorities in the future and nurtured my social liberal ideals. I could delve more into this episode but it is a good episode and holds up great to season two's standards. 7 of 10 (even after repeated viewings).",7

I got a huge kick out of Bones pumping one of the invaders full of formic acid, which would make anyone climb the walls---Scotty drinking another one of them under the table and then passing out himself (although in a good cause)---Spock, although unsuccessful with the mind-meld, nevertheless getting a good idea of what Kelinda really looked like---and most of all, Captain Kirk's ""apology"" which spread like wildfire and thoroughly discombooberated the Kelvans who now realized they were stuck with their human forms and could never return to Andromeda.

They also say that they are taking command of the Enterprise and its crew for the three hundred year journey home taking a message back that our galaxy is suitable for conquest. They demonstrate the power they have over Kirk and his team by first using a device on their belts which instantly immobilises a person; then when Kirk defies them another feature is used to turn the redshirts into cuboctahedral blocks. The leader of the Kelvans, Rojan, then crumbles one before bringing the other back to life. It doesn't take long for the Kelvans to take the Enterprise and make the modifications required to return home. Kirk misses one possible opportunity to destroy the ship before Rojan turns most of the crew into blocks. The Kelvans have a weakness though; by taking human form they are susceptible to human weaknesses and emotions.This episode gets off to a decent enough start with the introduction of the Kelvans, in particular their leader Rojan and an attractive female named Kelinda. Their powers are nicely demonstrated and Spock's attempt to use his mind powers tells us a bit about their true nature. Once on the Enterprise we have the dilemma of whether to destroy the ship in order to prevent an invasion that might come in six hundred years' time not that that anybody will expect that to happen! Once the senior crew realise the Kelvans are susceptible to human weaknesses things get quite amusing as Scotty gets one of them drunk, McCoy gives another injects saying they are vitamin supplements but actually they just make him very irritable and, perhaps inevitably Kirk sets about seducing the beautiful Kelinda causing Rojan to get jealous. Since the Kelvans have taken human form they aren't particularly interesting in appearance and the backless costumes worn by their females are clearly designed to please the male viewers not that I'm complaining!",8

This while Bones is drugging Hanar (Stewart Moss) with vitamin shots, and the Captain is seducing another space alien-babe (Barbara Bouchet as Kelinda). Getting the Kelvans to OD on human emotions seemed to have done the trick by the end of the episode, as their leader Rojan (Warren Stevens) finally agrees to Kirk's suggestion to have the Federation find them a place to stay. It's a bit of an anti-climactic resolution considering the Kelvans were starting out to conquer an entire galaxy, but hey, that's the way it goes sometimes.It wasn't often that the writers mentioned a series continuity element, but they did it here by recalling Eminiar VII and Spock's prior use of a Vulcan Mind Probe. That would have occurred in #1.23 - A Taste of Armageddon, and I don't seem to remember it now, so I'll have to go back and take a look.Another interesting point was made about the idea of intergalactic travel. With the Enterprise routinely engaging in multiple warp factors and the distance between galaxies being impossibly distant to comprehend, the idea that it would take the commandeered ship three hundred years and more than a few generations of Kelvan and Earth descendants to get there was a nice touch. By then, Kirk and Kelinda might have created an entirely new species.",7
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" By Any Other Name (TV Episode 1968)",The Enterprise Hits Warp 11,"In ""By Any Other Name"", the Enterprise heads to a planet's surface after receiving a distress call. It turns out to be a trap as a technologically superior race known as the Kelvans take over control of the Enterprsie with a weapon that can freeze people in a force field or turn them into a small rock. After discarding the unnecessary crew and leaving Kirk, Spock, Bones, and Scotty, the Kelvans steer the ship for their home world, a 300 year long journey intended to relay a message that the Kelvan have found hospitable planets to conquer in the Federation's galaxy. Kirk must figure out a way to wrestle back control of his ship and regain his crew from the Kelvan in control Rojan.This episode is... bizarre. It starts off very gruesome and dark; a member of the landing party is killed to send a message. The rest of the crew is placed in rock form and left for dead. The Enterprise is recommissioned as a taxi service taking the Kelvans back to their empire. Despite all this dire situation, the second half becomes very light-hearted and comical. Spock figures out that since the Kelvans were forced to take human form, they can be corrupted with human desires. Scotty turns one of the Kelvans into an alcoholic and drinks him under the table. Kirk puts the moves on another, seducing her, much to the chagrin of Rojan who has developed feelings for her in this short time. Spock sows seeds of distrust between Kirk and Rojan, aggravating things further.Everything is all tidied up nicely in the final few minutes. Kirk convinces Rojan to turn around and colonize the planet where the two men first met. Kelinda does a 180 and decides she loves Rojan instead of Kirk. Scotty passes out drunk. Everyone lives happily ever after or something. Alrighty then...The idea of a species forcing themselves to take humanoid form and then being corrupted by humanoid desires is a fun idea and has been done in Star Trek before (see Catspaw for one example), but the tonal shifts of this episode makes the payoff less fun. This episode either needs to stay dark like the first act or be comedic like the last two; combining the two is problematic.There's no repercussions for Rojan. He killed a member of Star Fleet for no good reason, yet nothing comes of this that we know of. The Enterprise is modded to go warp 11 by the Kelvans, yet this is never addressed in future episodes. The script is what is mostly wrong with this episode; it causes the tonal shift and leaves a lot of unanswered questions for the audience to have to piece together.",5

Hmm, actually, that is obvious; he was too drunk...? But then again, if you wanted to nit-pick, there is plenty to go at; for example, why, when approaching the 'negative energy, negative mass' of the galactic barrier, does the temperature increase and all the instruments start to 'go off the scale'? Do two negatives make a positive? The slightly nerdy amongst viewers will doubtless be wondering 'how can I go on, without knowing the correct name for the polyhedral shape of those tofu pieces?

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. After a good run on its first season, the second season has more expectations to fulfill and hopefully they will try to develop the character a bit more and focus on the relations between the crew members on the enterprise to blend in and communicate easily with the audience despite of just focusing on more mind-numb missions that sometimes feel like they are filling their time and work in.It was fast, gripping and more importantly a new concept where the episode takes the audience somewhere light and breezy (despite the stakes projected in here) as it keeps it simple and sensible throughout the course of it and gives enough reason for the viewers to stick by.",

This episode rates low with many Trek fans, as it ends up as a ham-handed paean to the concepts of liberty and posterity. These are lofty concepts to aspire to, but, much like ""Miri"" in the 1st season, the ideas exist within an unbelievable framework, even if it is a sf show. The story doesn't even bother to present a duplicate Earth here, as in ""Miri""; this Omega-4 is some other planet in another part of the galaxy which also had Yankees & Communists, the American Flag, the U.S.Constitution and (probably) Declaration of Independence, written in the exact same words. Some sf writers need to distinguish between other planets and other dimensions - this should have been some parallel dimension Earth tale or altered Earth history. However, it's a pretty exciting action episode and has, for me, one of the best villains of the original show.Whereas losing his crew in ""The Doomsday Machine"" drove Commodore Decker over the deep end, here Capt. Tracey (his ship is the Exeter) seems to have become more ruthless, more harsh. If ever there was a dark version of Capt. Kirk, an anti-Kirk, if you will, or an ultimate example of a starship captain gone bad, it's Tracey. He's like Kirk's evil older brother - taller, tougher, and possessed of the same indomitable will - geared towards non-Starfleet-like goals, including casual murder and even attempted genocide. He's somewhat obsessed about immortality for some reason and the economic gain from same, a throwback to yesteryear goals (this idea is revisited a century later in ""Star Trek Insurrection"" with the TNG crew); maybe he joined Starfleet with such goals in the back of his mind and hid his dark side from his peers all these past years. This is idle speculation and I suppose it's another weakness of the story that his backstory is never explained.Most of the episode, until the last couple of scenes, is quite gritty and brutal, what with the elements of bacteriological war and further tension of a village under siege by an army of savages. Kirk and Tracey seem to fight it out in nearly half the episode. But, it's worth a chuckle to Trekkers hearing Kirk's voice-over about how a Starfleet captain should give up his life before violating the Prime Directive. We remember Kirk's approach towards this non-interference directive on past missions - ""A Taste of Armageddon"" anyone? How about ""The Apple""? Uh, ""Return of the Archons""? Gee, it gets worse: lets even things out in ""A Private Little War""; stop the war in ""Patterns of Force."" What's Kirk talking about? To top things off, Kirk interferes with things at the very end of this episode, capping off Tracey's transgressions with his little instruction on how to read an important document. Spock hints to him he should have kept his mouth shut and Kirk just shrugs him off. Only one arrest per episode.",7
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Omega Glory (TV Episode 1968)",Strolling through a weedy quagmire,"For me, this is probably the first episode in the series that's a bit of a mess. That's not at all a bad record, because there are 54 episodes prior to this (in production order) that aren't a mess--they're mostly excellent. And it's not that this episode is terrible. It's entertaining enough to watch, but compared to everything that came before it, it's a bit too derivative, a bit too cloudy, and a bit ill conceived. It doesn't speak well of the fact that unlike the norm, Gene Roddenberry is the only credited writer on this episode.The core idea, apparently, was to provide a parallel Earth, and through that, suggest how things could have turned out differently had our history been different. The odd thing is that rather than being more metaphorical, Roddenberry chose to duplicate the Earth's peoples, cultures, and even countries and history. It turns out that the warring factions on the alien planet that the Enterprise visits is made up of Yankees and communist Asians, and the Yankees just so happen to be from the United States, they own a Holy Bible and they have The Declaration of Independence locked up in a box as a ""sacred document"".Roddenberry never even attempts to explain why this would be so. An answer might quickly suggest itself to Star Trek fans--that it stems from some long ago action that would presently (in the show's present) be considered a violation of the Prime Directive, but then that doesn't jive with the necessary timeline of events on the alien planet--both as stated and due to the ages of the participants--against the timeline of Earth and Starfleet. Making it more confusing, Roddenberry chose to have the historical divergence of the alien planet with respect to the Earth's history emerge from an event in an imagined future, circa 1968. So this is Roddenberry imagining how things might be different if an imagined future event went differently than his imagined future outcome.Another problem is that Roddenberry already came up with an intriguing plot, even if it's derivative of aspects of other Star Trek material, such as By Any Other Name (although considering that The Omega Glory was actually one of Roddenberry's earliest scripts, By Any Other Name probably borrowed the idea from here instead). Kirk and crew first visit an apparently abandoned Starfleet ship, only to discover that the entire crew of that ship save one died through some bizarre process that turned them into completely dehydrated crystals of various human chemicals. This plot, continuing with them beaming down to the planet and discovering that they've also caught the early stages of the same affliction, which is a remnant of biological warfare, and that they can't return to the Enterprise without risking the loss of a natural immunity that exists only on the planet is a good one, and more than enough (minus the unnecessary Fountain of Youth subplot) for a single episode.Again considering that this was an early script, some of the elements that became staples of Star Trek by the time they actually filmed The Omega Glory should have been changed. We get yet another Old West-styled prison that Kirk and Spock are held in. We get yet another half-crazy rogue Starfleet Captain. We get yet another blatant violation of the Prime Directive. Spock is yet again close to death. We get yet another instance of Kirk having to fight for his life against seemingly superior physical opponents. It's not that any of these elements are bad in themselves at this point, I suppose--they're common enough that they're stylistic staples of the show, but in the midst of this otherwise overloaded and murky episode, they don't help much.Still, it is fun to watch the ridiculousness meter max out towards the end, during what I think of as the ""witch trials"" between Kirk and Captain Tracey. The creative phonetic pronunciations of well known documents and oaths in English are a hoot, as are the bizarreness of the Yangs hauling out the American flag and Kirk's overblown speeches. But there are just too many poorly thought-out ideas to pull this episode into the upper echelons, where most of the others reside.",6
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Omega Glory (TV Episode 1968)",The absolutely most embarrassingly bad episode of the series,"This is my vote for the absolutely worst episode ever--even WORSE than the episode where they stole Spock's brain or the one where they caught up with the super-annoying hippies who'd stolen a shuttle craft!!! The first half or so isn't really that bad, but later, when it turns out that the Yangs and Coms are really Yankees and Chinese Communists the whole episode quickly degenerates to a huge mess!!! These people either somehow migrated to this planet without anyone knowing it or this society evolved exactly like on Earth in so many ways--both of which are ridiculous ideas. And I almost died of embarrassment and irritation when the Yangs brought out their ""holy documents"" that turned out to be the Constitution of the United States!!! Holy cow--this is the only show that made me HATE being an American and made my skin crawl with shame at how jingoistic and preachy the episode was. A total dud in every possible way--avoid this show at all cost!!! Don't say I didn't warn you.",1

No, strike that, it's got some serious plot holes, and Shatner's speechifying at the end is a double edged sword; it both helps salvage an iffy episode and at the same time drive another nail into a story that was half baked.But, for all that, I happen to think it an okay installment. The starship captain gone rogue is something that would have reared its head sooner or later in the series, so why not here?Yes, the whole Com (Kohm?) and Yang thing was trite. It feel very deus machina, but only in retrospect. By the time the planet's environment and history are fully surmised you're too invested to take any notice. Oh sure, you'll have the ""what now?"" moment, and maybe even a touch of ""oh-come-on"" if you're an unforgiving sci-fi fan, but, imagine you don't know the back-story for a moment. If the story had been set in a purely alien environment it would've have worked just as well, if not better by the mere fact that Trek wasn't recycling the parallel-Earth thing.And that's kind of the heart of matter. Morgan Woodward is an excellent actor, and gives us a black shirted starfleet officer with gold braid. He's the heavy, and does a superb job. The fact that the production values had to fit within a certain budget isn't his fault, nor the fault of any of the cast. The story of an officer falling for temptation is not a unique one. Here the execution is a little wobbly, but otherwise it grabs and keeps your attention. Me, I don't find this episode to be too much of a mess. If the two warring factions in this episode had been Polka-dot aliens versus the striped aliens, would that have made this episode any better? I'm not sure it would have. It may have led some credibility to the science and fiction in this work of science-fiction, but, to me at least, it's a secondary consideration. We're here to see Kirk, Spock and McCoy bring Ron Tracy to justice. They're met with some obstacles, but it all works out. How does the setting alter this? Personally, I don't think it does (or at least not by much).If I had a real complaint, it would be the fact that Woodward's character seemed to really fly off the handle. And I mean in a big way. He wasn't sinister so much as obsessed with riches and long life. I guess a starship pension wasn't good enough for him. Oh well.Look, bash it if you like, because this episode deserves some of the criticisms leveled at it, but it is sci-fi show made in the 60s.

If you are a fan of Star Trek and have somehow managed to avoid seeing this debacle, do yourself a favor and avoid it.I have read all sorts of cockamamie explanations offered for this episode, and all of them defy logic. One theory you will read about in some other reviews is that the two tribes of Yangs and Kohns are descendants of two separate American and Chinese colonies that were sent here from Earth and forgotten about. One big problem with that is that we are told that at least one of the Kohns is 1000 years old. Which means that at least 1000 years before this episode, and probably a lot longer go than that, people on Earth would have had to have possessed the capability to transport colonies of people to distant planets. Yet the original Star Trek supposedly occurs somewhere around the mid 23rd century. Which means the ancestors of the Yangs and Kohns had to come from Earth no later than the 13th century - way before any capability for flight, and indeed before there was any U.S. Constitution (which figures prominently in this episode), or any Chinese Communists. The whole thing is ridiculous - besides being little more than patriotic pablum.It is an embarrassing mess which IMO is only entertaining for being unintentionally laughable.",1

Kirk, Spock, and McCoy beam down to the planet surface, and learn that the inhabitants are immune, and that the newest inhabitant is Ron Tracey, captain of the Exeter. Unfortunately, the inhabitants of the planet are divided into the urban-dwelling ""Khoms"" and the more rustic ""Yangs,"" each in deadly combat with the others.While the message of the piece is patriotic and right-wing by late 1960s standards, it would be tolerable if it wasn't so obvious. Likewise, the parallels to some very familiar Earth historical patterns are so implausible as to make it clear this is an anti-Communist screed (which is not so problematic, assuming that it's done with deftness and intelligent writing, rather than Jack Webb-ish clumsiness). Compounding the problem is the cardboard, over-the-top acting of Morgan Woodward (Tracey) and Roy Jenson, and Shatner.Don't bother.",2
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Omega Glory (TV Episode 1968)",A very underrated action episode,"I really like this episode up to the point where the American Flag makes its appearance. It starts to go downhill when the parallel of Yangs/Yanks and Kohms/Communists comes into play. Though Shatner really goes over the top during his Declaration of Independence speech, it still sends a chill up my spine when he reads it. I especially like the line, ""It must apply to EVERYONE or it means NOTHING! Do you understand!"" There is lots of action in this episode, and Morgan Woodward pulls off another strong performance as Captain Tracy. I've always been surprised when I see this episode near the bottom of other fans' rankings. I think this episode is very underrated. I'm giving ""The Omega Glory"" a solid B grade and consider this to be at or near the Top 25.",7
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Omega Glory (TV Episode 1968)",Tragically Misunderstood and Unfairly Criticized,"Sadly, this episode is very lowly rated by fans, and a recipient of much unfair criticism. This is undoubtedly due to a misunderstanding regarding the origin and premise of the story.This story was one of the two dozen or so, that Roddenberry presented to the networks, when initially pitching to them the idea of ""Star Trek."" At this early stage, it had not been established just how far into the future the series would supposedly take place. Some of his story ideas were set in a future only a few decades from the present, while others were set centuries, or a thousand years, into the future. This story was envisioned as being set *many* centuries into the future. The people on Omega IV were the descendants of two Earth colonies, one American, one Communist Chinese, which had left Earth centuries before, and had long since been forgotten and ""written off.""This concept was even part of the original television episode, as evidenced by this bit of trivia:..................................Another McCoy-Spock debate was filmed for this episode, but edited. Just before the landing party left the Yangs' flag room, Kirk cut short an argument which seems to be about nothing. The reason McCoy and Spock were in an argument was cut from the episode. The dialog excised from the final print was as follows (taken from the final draft shooting script for the episode): McCoy: Jim, the parallel's too close. They seem so completely Human. Is it possible that... ? Kirk: The result of Earth's early space race? Spock: Quite possible, Captain. They are aggressive enough to be Human. McCoy: Now listen, Spock, you....................................But instead, over the years, we have been presented with a plethora of ridiculous ""parallel development"" theories, and such. Sad.If taking into account the original concept behind this episode, I easily rate it a 10 out of 10.",10
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Omega Glory (TV Episode 1968)","""Liberty and freedom have to be more than just words"".","On the heels of Episode #2.21 - Patterns of Force, which dealt with a Nazi vs. Jews theme, Gene Roddenberry ups the ante with a story featuring a take on American Democracy against Soviet Communism. This one could have been a Top Ten contender had the writing fleshed out a basic plot line, but instead, Kirk and Company find themselves on a planet where the primitives' holy book is The Bible, and their 'worship words' are patterned on the Preamble to the Constitution. What I see as troubling for most fans is the idea that this could have developed totally devoid of influence from Earth's past history, the topper being the finale appearance of a battered American flag! It's too much to ask of the average viewer, even in a series where the fantastic is expected.I think I've kept tabs pretty well as I watch the show in episode order, and if I'm not mistaken, this might be the first time the Prime Directive is called the Prime Directive. In prior episodes (2.17 - A Piece of the Action, 2.21 - Patterns of Force), the Federation mandate was referred to as the Noninterference Directive. Not that it matters much, they pretty much describe satisfactorily the idea that civilizations shouldn't be tampered with at any stage of evolution. If only the series had remained true to that concept, but enough examples abound to contradict that imperative.I'll say this though, I was rather intrigued by the name of Cloud William, the character portrayed by Roy Jensen. It has sort of an American Indian connotation, along with the mention of Omega IV's cycle of the red bird equaling eleven Earth years. But it's not enough to hold the less plausible elements of this story together, even with Captain Kirk's stirring defense of freedom and liberty before the final curtain.",7
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Omega Glory (TV Episode 1968)",Maybe the worst episode,"This stinker- which was the worst episode to date by a very long chalk when first broadcast- illustrates a common phenomenon in TV script writing when different writers are responsible for each episode.The writer of this one had clearly been shown the scripts of the episodes that shot immediately before, and blatantly ripped off a lot of their core concepts. Two obvious ones are having the plague crew reduced to powder, matching the alien trick of reducing Kirk's crew to geometric chunks of crystalline material an episode or so earlier. Then, of course, we have the nutty protagonist completely inspired by the rogue federation individual who introduced 'nazi' ideology to an alien planet one or two episodes back.The tribal backlot nonsense of the main story was just taking the mickey out of earlier episodes only written because of available costumes and backlot sets. And the horrifyingly awful end, when the aliens are revealed to be racist depictions of Americans and Chinese communists, with the same symbols and national documents of the actual USA, is the author expressing his opinion about the size of the cheque he got for writing this dribble.However, given other shows of the period (and decades later) frequently had maybe 30% of their episodes this badly written, the fact that TOS had so few truly poor episodes speaks very well of the show and those responsible for its creation.",1
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Omega Glory (TV Episode 1968)",Badly Written with No plausible Explanation-One of the Worst!,"How can there be a ""parallel"" United States in another universe? Everyone speaks English, the ""Yangs"" (Yanks) have an American Flag and the U.S. Constitution. How this is possible is never explained, and it should have been for the episode to make any sense at all. The crazy and deranged star ship captain of the Exeter is the only one left. His entire crew has turned into rock salt crystals (A cheap special effect) and he thinks he has discovered the ""Fountain of Youth"" but it's only an antibody reaction to a mutated disease. (Also done before.) Kirk has his usual hand-to-hand combat scenes and another red-shirt bites the dust. Another cheap exploitation of the old back lot sets of Paramount Pictures. Almost unwatchable. A mercy ""5"". I almost gave it a ""1"". It makes ""The Galileo Seven"" (A toothless giant in a fur coat) and The Devil in the Dark"" (a rubber monster suit) seem like good episodes!",5
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Omega Glory (TV Episode 1968)","""We killed THOUSANDS and STILL THEY CAME!""","It was inevitable, sooner or later I was gonna get up to John Meredith Lucas's final episode of STAR TREK. Written by Gene Roddenberry shortly after ""The Cage"", ""The Omega Glory"" was actually the 1st of the (so-called) ""parallel Earth"" episodes, a concept apparently hatched as a con to make the networks think they could cut costs by re-using existing sets (kinda like THE TIME TUNNEL-- heh). It was offered as one of the 3 possibles for the 2nd pilot, but, thankfully, not chosen, in fact, unlike ""Mudd's Women"", downright shelved! (Since learning it was written so early, it hit me that it probably inspired the somewhat-similar ""Miri"", which I always felt was the WORST episode of the entire 1st season-- by a mile!) I've long felt this was a very stupid episode, and I've found online that a lot of fans feel the same way, often ranking it as ""one of the worst"" in the entire series.My original impressions remained intact watching it UNCUT again tonight. The opening sequence is the most intriguing part, where they discover the crystalline remains of the Exeter crew. (I did, after all these years, suddenly find myself wondering WHY Kirk didn't have the Exeter scanned for life before beaming over; instead, he gets on the ship's intercom and asks, ""Is anyone on board?"") I've since learned that Morgan Woodward had a long career in westerns, but man, to me, he will always be Captain Ron Tracy-- a starship commander who due to circumstances went COMPLETELY INSANE!! Matt Decker (from ""The Doomsday Machine"") has nothing on this guy. One scene I hadn't seen in ages (clearly it's usually cut in syndication) was when Tracy decides to talk with a bound Kirk and, after quoting regulations at length, give him his reasons for violating ""The Prime Directive"". (Did Roddenberry really come up with this idea so early? In the order of filming, it didn't turn up until halfway thru the 1st season.) All that aside, if there's any reason Kirk should NOT have played ball with the guy, it's when Tracy, for NO apparent reason, VAPORIZED the already-injured Lt. Galloway! (Was he trying to make a point?) Between Kirk & Cloud William in the cell, Kirk & Tracy in the street (with a battle-axe!!), and Kirk & Tracy in front of the assembled tribe, this episode has no less than 3 of the most BRUTAL fight scenes in STAR TREK history! Just the kind of thing to grab the attention of the average viewers (and no doubt keep the network happy).Of course, the extreme annoyance of focusing on The Prime Directive aside, I didn't mind the ""parallel development"" concept here so much... that is, until the FINALE. When they pulled out the flag of the United States of America, followed by the US Constitution-- ""WE-- THE PEOPLE..."", that just went too far over the line for me. Always did, always will.And yet... and yet... in spite of this, tonight I found this episode remains one GRIPPING watch. You just can't take your eyes off it-- no matter how stupid Tracy's actions got, no matter how outrageous Gene Roddenberry's ideas about sci-fi got, no matter how preachy Jim Kirk got. In fact, when Kirk speaks to Cloud William and the tribe, in spite of, if not because of how outrageous it is, I felt myself welling up with emotion. It's GOOD to be an American, and REMEMBER what BEING an American is supposed to be about.Whatta ya know? I ENJOYED this tonight. And I remember that, yes, there ARE several ST's that are MUCH worse, and far more unwatchable than this one. (Including ""Miri"", ""The Paradise Syndrome"", ""And The Children Shall Lead"")Funny enough, the plot about a Federation officer violating the Prime Directive and trying to wipe out an indigenous population so he can profit from something on a planet that could benefit the rest of the galaxy wound up being reused in the movie STAR TREK: INSURRECTION. (That film also borrowed the ""back to nature"" theme of another oft-maligned ST episode, ""The Way To Eden"".)",5
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Omega Glory (TV Episode 1968)",Racism... the Polar Opposite of Star Trek,"I have to get this off my chest. I see so many idiots who like this episode purely because ""it's a cool idea."" They missed the entire basis of the dislike if they think the story, which is illogical and filled with plot holes by itself, is the basis for hatred against this episode. This is the only episode of Star Trek I've ever seen that suffers from this very serious problem that no Star Trek movie or show since this episode has ever repeated. And that's the blatant racism. In the context of this story, the audience is supposed to accept the racism as morally correct.In this story, a planet has evolved similar to earth (with no explanation) so that the good guys, who are all white, are the enslaved Yankees, persecuted by the evil, and completely Chinese, communists. The white Yankees have all the American tropes, our historic documents and symbols of freedom. Then you have the immortal force of evil in the Chinese Communists, who are far more dangerous an advanced and kidnap yankees and lock them up for their own amusement.This message contradicts a message in a previous episode known as ""Errand Of Mercy"" stating that the Cold War was stupid as it was purely based on fear with no origin in hostile intent from the other. This episode contradicts that beautiful statement through promoting the racist contortions we created in this time period. It promotes that foreigners are these evil and unnatural creatures, twisted as savages and against the American ideals and thus a threat which should be destroyed. The worst part in all of this, is that it's the polar opposite of Star Trek. Star Trek represented the putting aside of differences, that no race was above another and that all peoples of all races should be equal, contradicting the supposedly ""happy"" ending of this episode where literally only the white Yankees are literally granted this, in the stupid twist ending. It promoted that no race was completely bad, even if its rulers promoted evil. It didn't paint such a blindly overall image of a race in a way like this.This episode promoted casting out a specific race, throwing everything Star Trek stood for in one episode. It threw away the peace in overcoming differences and cast aside the equality in literally saying that only one specific race should have it. Gene Roddenberry must have been sick at the sight of this episode, probably helping to fuel his decision to leave the show after this season.",1
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Omega Glory (TV Episode 1968)",Stupid but Memorable,"Somehow, whenever I chance upon a rerun of the original series, this is the episode that seems to be on. It involves a gross misuse of the prime directive. A Starship Captain has gone bonkers, thinking he is on the verge of the discovery of the fountain of youth. The indigenous races seem to be able to live for centuries. The Yangs and the Kohms are the races, and they are engaged in a constant battle for superiority. Kirk gets embroiled in their business and gets knocked around quite a bit. The point is that somehow this fellow needs to be stopped and the war he is promoting needs to be stopped. The final scene where Kirk begins pontificating, is about as incredible (and I mean in a really negative way) as any scene in all of Star Trek. This may be one of the worst episodes of all time.",4

But the concept of what one man from the 23rd (or whatever century they are in) taken back to today with an arsenal of hand phasers makes it worth the price of admission alone for me. That said, I would be very hesitant to label any one episode as the ""worse"" one. Trek should be viewed as a whole movie almost to me. There are episodes that feature lots of technology and action, and there are episodes that are funny, and there are episodes that explore emotions, so some episodes will undoubtedly appeal to the individual more than others depending on your tastes. Give it a try, it's certainly not the best but I feel the Omega Glory is far from being my least liked episode (that distinction for me belongs to Turnabout Intruder or maybe Is There in Truth no Beauty?, or maaaybe even The Lights Of Zetar, take your pick, but leave Spocks Brain alone!

I hear Kirk's recitation of the preamble of the Constitution and believe that the episode is an excellent defense of the values of the enlightenment and Rule of Law. The enlightenment produced a number of political philosophers that have established the democratic societies that we value today. They were not just American philosophers like Jefferson, Adams, and Madison but also European philosophers like Adam Smith, Locke and Rousseau.What's wrong with the preamble?""We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.""These are the words that can establish peace between the Yangs and the Kohms and reestablish individual rights and rule of law.Move over this episode remains relevant today given how laws are changing throughout the western world as we try to find a balance of individual freedom and the need for order as the West tries to find a way contain Islamic terrorism.There are many things that American have a right to be proud of.",10

It descends into racism when the Mongol/Hun- costumed humanoids are proved to be ""Asiatic"" ""Communists"" - terms that are actually used to demonize one of the cultures on the host planet!This episode starts out great. It seems like an adaptation of Heart of Darkness with a similar gritty interpretation as Apocalypse Now. Dark, intense, with moral ambiguity that makes you expect something like ""A Taste of Armageddon.""I'll ignore the inconsistency regarding the Prime Directive (""don't interfere,"" of course they always do). You can have fun with an episode that is inconsistent, and it seems like half of the early Star Trek episodes were like this.35 minutes in, the story has already started to get a bit confused. But it is still good. No episode is perfect. But then we get a not- so-subtle claim of ""resemblances"" to Earth's history (actually just a ""resemblance"" to a bad stereotype that has never been true of the US and the Communist bloc states).I like to think that Robert Justman's ""devastating"" assessment of the script might have had the following advice which I would have given Roddenberry (who wrote the script): ● Use less overt symbols ● Don't use ""Asiatics"" and communists ● Anyone with any integrity *has* to make the point that both sides (The Western and Eastern (communist) blocs) had legitimate ideas about freedom and neither side was very good at living up to them.**This episode ultimately features a glorified side genociding the ""Asiatic Communists**I would have liked to have seen both sides humanized. That is normally what happens (and despite what people like to say about Kirk, he usually ended up being great at this, if inconsistent). The moral/ethical dimension usually got explored with a heart-felt, sensitive assessment. In this episode, the opposite basically happens.**Why this episode is so offensive if you love Americans, Communists, or Human beings with different ideas**Marx, in remarks that were embraced by the Soviets and Chinese, said that mankind cannot be free until he has control over his economic life. Just as the US failed its excellent ideals of freedom during its McCarthyist phase, the Soviet and Chinese states actively undermined the institutions of Workers' power, which themselves should have had primacy, according to Marx.In the end, both the West and East had theories which have a lot of truth to them. Even if Roddenberry wanted to be a partisan on this, producers should be nuanced enough to realize that the heavy hand of such a black and white viewpoint is not fitting for any show, least of all ""forward-thinking"" Star Trek.**Conclusion**To top off this sanctimony, the ""good side"" in this episode is literally trying to genocide the ""bad side."" It's strongly implied that this is what is happening in the final sequences. I cannot think of any other show or movie which has glorified ethnic cleansing or genocide. Even propaganda for groups that do stuff like that usually pretends that it's not happening.I cannot believe that this episode got approval - it is literally the opposite from the message of ""Patterns of Force,"" where the crew try to stop a genocide by Nazi-uniformed ""humanoids."" Let alone ""A Private Little War."" **Avoid** this episode unless you are a completionist. Any selective viewings of TOS episodes should avoid this unless they are actually looking for these quirks. Cynics could find hilarity in the Jingoism here, but even I can't help but feel a bit disheartened that Star Trek aired this monstrosity.",3

I wonder how he felt when reading and performing this script? I kind of like this episode, it stands out in my memory, but it is a little contrived plot. I'm sure that had a lot to do with the time when it was written. I would have liked to have seen more explanation or reasoning as to why this planet was so like America, even to the point of having our exact documents and flag.

There is nobody aboard; just uniforms containing a crystalline residue which analysis shows to be human remains. The medical logs state that they became contaminated on the planet below and anybody contacting them will become contaminated too. The only way to survive is to remain on the planet.The team beam down and find themselves in a town where relatively backward villagers are preparing to execute two captives who are apparently savages. The execution is stopped by the sole survivor of the Exeter, Capt. Ron Tracey. He explains that they are in a Kohm village and the savage Yangs are waging a war against them. It turns out Tracey has broken the prime directive by arming the Kohms because he has learnt that not only are people living on the surface immune to the condition that killed his crew; they also live to a great age; he intends to find out how then make a fortune with the knowledge. Tracey has Kirk, Spock and McCoy locked up, Galloway is dead by now, and while confined Kirk is put in a cell with a Yang. After a fight the Yang escapes and warns his people about a Kohm ambush. They are then victorious and take the village; it is then that Kirk learns that the Yangs have some shocking similarities with the United States; only this society lost a war and forget the meanings of its familiar 'holy words'.This episode gets off to a fine start with the discovery of the Exeter and the state of its crew. Things continue well on the planet as we are introduced to a society that we learn has been set back centuries after a bacteriological war as well as introducing Capt. Tracey. Morgan Woodward did a fine job in as this increasingly insane character. The ongoing conflict between the Kohms and the Yangs was interesting until the Yangs final victory then everything goes wrong. Until then the Asiatic looking Kohms were portrayed as the more civilised and the European looking Yangs are savages; then it becomes apparent that we are meant to be supporting the Yangs as they are a parallel the a United States that has suffered a defeat; they even have the same flag and 'Holy Words' identical to introduction to the US Constitution even if they need Kirk to explain their true meaning. I'm not sure if the creators of the episode wanted to stir the patriotic feelings of US viewers or (hopefully) make them think about the true meaning and intentions of their constitution before using it to justify their views if it is the former it is just embarrassing; if the latter it doesn't seem to succeed very well; I wondered if I 'just didn't get it' because I'm not American but reviews from the US seem fairly mixed too just like this episode.

I remember Reagans star-wars defense initiative looking like the first step to this episode. It always seemed totally plausible to me that this episode was a real possible future, assuming we won against Communism. Try watching it and Kirk's nostalgic reading with this in mind. Like ""That's right, humanity did win against tyranny and moved past totalitarianism."" It gave me chills hearing it,even through the corn, as you realized it meant that we had won, and the cold war was over (even though only in the star trek future at my first watching of it.)

24,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Omega Glory (TV Episode 1968)",The Most Relevant Episode of the Series in 2015,"It's sad to see that practically every other reviewer who bothered to post here is so mired in a world of fantasy that they could not grasp the point of this. It's as though this is a forum from a fifth-grade Star Trek club (I knew people in the sixth grade that were more perceptive). This is a classic old-fashioned sci-fi story of the genre that produced H.G. Wells and Ray Bradbury and Aldous Huxley and Isaac Asimov. Like most things on the original Star Trek TV series, it is a morality tale. It's not about the ""Prime Directive"" or ""parallel development"" any other such juvenile nonsense. It's about Good and Evil and more specifically about empty-headed, mindless flag-waving versus actually understanding what your flag and your country is supposed to stand for. It even touches on the issues of political lying and manipulation. It is a classic use of the science fiction setting as a metaphor for a contemporary real-life issue that in this case in particular affects practically every American practically every day. There could not be an episode more relevant to the America of 2015, where the country is practically aflame with empty-headed jingoes who can't stop going on and on about the Constitution or the exact wording pledge of allegiance while just the least close examination quickly reveals that most of the loudest screamers don't understand the first thing about what either really means. Worse still, unlike ""Cloud William"" here, almost none of the loudest have any interest in learning anything beyond those things, which they will repeat ad nauseum, they erroneously believe they already know. Star Trek, like any other half-way serious American TV drama of it's time, regularly made commentary on the times in which it was made, and in watching this recently I thought back to what was going on in the country and the world in 1968 to lead to this particular story. While it is plain enough what it says about America in 2015, what was it saying about 1968, when from my memory it was the flag-burning protester in the street rather than any flag-waver anywhere else that was the focal point of popular attention? I marveled to think that the mindless ugliness so central to today's politics could have been foreseen almost 50 years ago. Be that as it may, I referred this episode to another 1300-SAT-score friend of mine who is involved in American politics, as political commentary on our own times every bit as relevant as Jon Stewart (even if it is not as funny).*** Just recently (February, 2017, and again in September,2017) I reread this review and noticed that as of the latter date ""3 out of 20"" people found it useful. It is good to know that there are at least three Star Trek fans who are video enthusiasts out there who are not brain-dead. As for the rest, they bring to mind for me the words of the venerable William Shatner himself to a group of trekkies on Saturday Night Live back around the year 1986. If you won't listen to me, maybe you'll listen to HIM: ""Get a life.""",10

Of course, that's not exactly true. The idea of an artificially intelligent computer becoming a problem popped up in science-fiction at least shortly after Alan Turing re-popularized the idea of artificial intelligence in the 1950s via what's become known as the ""Turing Test"" for just that property. Also, Kubrick's 2001, written in conjunction with sci-fi novelist Arthur C. Clarke, began production in 1965, and there are more ideas there than just AI gone haywire, as there are in The Ultimate Computer. But this episode underscores that Star Trek deserves consideration as ""serious artwork"", consideration that it doesn't often receive outside of the Trekkie community. Even though Star Trek didn't likely influence 2001, the reverse isn't the case, either; rather, both works arrived at similar ideas due to mindfulness towards relatively cutting edge ideas in science and science fiction.By this point, in case you're looking for a plot summary, you surely know that The Ultimate Computer has something to do with an artificially intelligent computer. It arrives on board the Enterprise courtesy of Dr. Richard Daystrom (William Marshall, soon after The Ultimate Computer to forever be best known as Blacula), a computer genius who long ago designed the basics of the system currently employed on the Enterprise. To test his new system, which is supposed to be able to run the ship more or less by itself, Starfleet orders all but 20 crew members off of the Enterprise and organizes a fairly elaborate war game scenario. Of course, we know as soon as we find out the premise that it's probably a recipe for some kind of disaster.Aside from the usual AI kinda themes, writers Gene Roddenberry, Laurence N. Wolfe and D.C. Fontana use the episode for a nice exploration of ill-conceived idealism, more general technological skepticism and unease, overly fervent parental apologetics, and difficult utilitarian ethical decisions. The performances are excellent as always (and I always wished that Marshall would have had a more prolific career), and we get a bonus treat of a very Kirk-like head of another Starfleet ship, Commodore Robert Wesley (Barry Russo).",10
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Ultimate Computer (TV Episode 1968)",An Ultimate Episode?,"Everyone has their favorite Trek episode and while this one may not be my favorite, it's really close. If your looking for a high tech starship to starship action packed battle episode this has got to rank right behind The Doomsday Machine (James Doohan said that was his favorite episode (as it was mine when I saw him at age 13 in the 70's)). The guest has most of the great dialog moments so there are no memorable Kirk/Spock/Bones banter scenes, but still William Marshall is a great guest to take the spotlight, isn't he? So why do I really like this episode? A space ship is destroyed early on (how many TOS episodes did that happen in the beginning?, not many), than the Enterprise takes on FOUR starships of it's same class (I'm sure the limited budget made that the case and that they were all pics of the same model, but who cares?!). Great scene here is when the computer picks the landing party, was that putting Kirk in his place or what? I felt for Kirk in this one, how many episodes does that happen in? I remember when I watched this episode for the FIRST time, I WAS RIVETED! If I was 13 years old again this would rank easily in my top 5, but since now I like McCoy/Spock/Kirk (in those order) exchanges (and the edge of first viewing has well worn off dozens of viewings ago), I'll just give it a 10 out of sentimentality and because it is still a really good episode.",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Ultimate Computer (TV Episode 1968)",When Both Men and their Machines Go Mad,"An ultimate computer? That point will probably never be reached. The computer here, M-5, was intended as the next step up from the 23rd century starship machines which were also designed by the genius Daystrom. Under the test guidelines in this episode, the Enterprise is emptied of all but 20 personnel and the new M-5 is plugged in, running standard ship's operations, such as navigation and entering into orbit around a planet. Later, the plan is to indulge in war games with a quartet of other starships, testing M-5's calculations during a battle. It's man vs.machine; it's human workers vs. the automated line; it's all about...becoming obsolete. Some of this reminded me of an episode on the TNG show, the one where Dr.Crusher found herself on an Enterprise increasingly devoid of people, until only she and Capt. Picard remain in charge, the rest of the ship run automatically. Automation seems to make sense for a few seconds, but then you realize there's the absurdity of all those empty cabins; what's the point of a huge ship, manned by only a few people, the rest of it always empty except maybe when you have a bunch of guests on board? This is what Daystrom seems to be proposing; he speaks of other glorious pursuits men can aspire to rather than running about in space. But, exploration of space is the ultimate glory for mankind. Daystrom can't win this one - it's absurd.The story revolves around the goals and aspirations of two men - Kirk and Daystrom. Kirk's career appears to be in danger of winding down very quickly in the first act - replaced by machinery, while Daystrom's might be gaining a second wind after 25 years of stagnation. It all revolves around the personal needs of these two men - what they need in life to feel functional, to be useful. The situation reverses in the 2nd half of the episode: I mentioned why Daystrom had to lose and, besides, this is Kirk's show. But Kirk has some doubtful moments before the M-5 proves to be unreliable; the reference to 'Capt.Dunsel' is particularly awkward and McCoy steps in for the viewer as we start to feel actual pity for this beleaguered captain, reduced to rambling about old sailing ships in his cabin. I sensed a calculated lack of tact on Kirk's part later, when the tables are turned and his job appears safe again; McCoy tells him that Daystrom is on the verge of a nervous breakdown - so what does Kirk do? He picks that moment to tell the tottering genius that his child must die. Of course, this sends Daystrom over the edge, into total madness. Daystrom's story continues a pattern of what happens to other famous personages in the 23rd century when they run across Kirk - they either go crazy or are killed. The actor, Marshall, was suitably imposing as the 'wrapped too tightly' computer genius - especially in that memorable scene of him towering over Kirk, ranting away. Kirk's quick solution to the whole mess is the weakest part, since we've seen it before (""Return of the Archons"" and ""The Changeling"") but this episode may also explain why the computer systems in the 24th century, on the TNG show, were essentially the same - no chance of having to talk a computer out of killing hundreds of Starfleet personnel.",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Ultimate Computer (TV Episode 1968)",M5 Computer Takes Over The Enterprise,"Season 2, episode 24. By Federation orders, the Enterprise is ordered to participate in computer wargames. Kirk is forced to a very minimal skeleton crew, the M5 computer is installed on board the Enterprise by it's inventor Dr. Richard Daystrom while Starfleet is very optimistic the M5 work - in the name of progress. M5 does what it's designed to do in a test drill which leaves Kirk and the skeleton crew more nervous but when an oil freighter passes by M5 chases it down and fires at it, causing it to explode. Kirk orders the M5 to be stopped but the M5 has learned to defend itself and will not allow humans to shut if off. Dr. Daystrom invented M5 to help save lives but when he sees everything going wrong and even killing a crewman he and his M5 tries to stop Kirk and his skeleton crew from disabling the computer and taking back their ship. M5 has taken over everything from communications to warp drive to weapons. Dr. Daystrom loves his ""child"", the M5, while Kirk and crew are having trouble waking him up from his M5 dream of helping humanity.A fantastic episode that entertains the idea of computers/machines getting smarter and taking over to help humans. But, what happens when the computer goes wrong? 9/10",9
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Ultimate Computer (TV Episode 1968)",Vindication in the future,"William Marshall's character of Dr. Richard Daystrom a future expert in cybernetics has been completely vindicated in even more future episodes in the Star Trek franchise. In Star Trek The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine and Voyager there are references to the Daystrom Institute that has been founded on earth. It's fully explained in this story that Daystrom is a great man of science and he must have been to have his work and reputation recover from the folly of this particular experiment.The Enterprise has been reduced to a skeleton crew of 19 including the cast members and on board is William Marshall who has installed his brand new state of the art M5 super computer which will run the ship with only a skeleton staff needed for maintenance.Need I say that things go horribly wrong as the computer starts making command decision. It also has developed a most human instinct for its own survival. All this is most distressing for Marshall who sees the M5 as the crowning achievement in an illustrious scientific career. The machine is like a child to him and he behaves as a parent.I won't go into what happens, but the Enterprise does run amuck during battlefield maneuvers and is saved because of the instinct and humanity of another of the Starship captains.A really well done Star Trek about humanity and humans. No machine can replace us.",8
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Ultimate Computer (TV Episode 1968)",Interesting Story of Obsession and Mechanization,"The Enterprise is used as the testing ground for a revolutionary new type of computer device (the M-5), developed by master computer developer and programmer Richard Daystrom (William Marshall), for the purpose of testing whether a computer can handle every function of a starship. When the concept is tested during Federation war games, however, the project goes drastically wrong.The subject of obsession has been handled many times on the series (e.g., Operation: Annihilate; The Doomsday Machine; and, of course, Obsession), as has the conflict between mechanization and humanity, and this episode does a fairly good job in balancing by using its counterbalancing performances from Shatner and Marshall. Shatner effectively conveys the anguish of human work being replaced by an unthinking, unfeeling machine in his interaction with Daystrom, his nicely conveyed helplessness when the computer takes complete command away (and when all hell breaks loose), and his scene with McCoy (where he references John Masefield's ""Sea Fever"") is quite poignant. From the other side, watching Marshall as his almost obnoxious confidence crumbles from beneath him is just as potent -- and believable under the circumstances. Indeed, what some regard as ""overacting"" from Marshall is entirely in character coming from a man who resents living off of his reputation, and who compensates with unabashed bravado; his eventual breakdown, where he effectively speaks to the M-5 as though he were trying to save his own child's life presents its own fascinating questions about what Daystrom has sacrificed to become the revered figure he is.The supporting performances are fine, and both Nimoy and Kelley get in some nice work. On the writing side, D.C. Fontana's script leaves some big questions in the credibility department as to why Starfleet would use the M-5 in war games with a ship with a full armament, when it presumably had not been tested in other circumstances requiring more than simply linear judgment. Nonetheless, these flaws are more than compensated for by the effective human story underlying it.While it may not rate quite as highly as The Doomsday Machine (or William Windom's performance in it), The Ultimate Computer and Marshall are definitely worth watching.",8
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Ultimate Computer (TV Episode 1968)",Giving control to a computer,"Computer genius Dr Richard Daystrom has developed a new computer, the M-5, which he believes can take over the functions of most members of a star ship's crew. To test M-5 it is fitted aboard the Enterprise and, with only a minimal crew aboard it is to take part in a series of tests. Kirk is unimpressed but is that just because he feels he is being made redundant. M-5 performs admirably in early tests but then something goes wrong; an unmanned freighter is engaged and destroyed despite the crew's attempts to stop the attack. Daystrom considers this to be a minor hiccough but Kirk it is time to disconnect M-5 and end the tests. The problem is M-5 doesn't want to be disconnected and kills the engineer who tries to remove its power supply. The limited crew struggle against M-5 before the next part of the drill where the Enterprise is to be engaged by four Star Fleet vessels. This is to no avail and the ships are engaged at full power leading to enormous casualties. We learn that M-5 has been programmed to act like a human being; based naturally enough on Daystrom. It is this humanity Kirk will have to appeal to if he is to prevent further loss of life.This is a superior episode for many reasons. Firstly we see Kirk confronting the fact that with the installation of M-5 he may have become redundant on his own ship; M-5 operates the ship more efficiently that its human crew and makes superior decisions. Then when it becomes apparent that M-5 is inherently dangerous there is the excitement of seeing how the remaining crew will deal with it. We also have Daystrom's reaction to M-5's behaviour; something akin to a parent defending a child who has gone off the rails; William Marshall did a fine job in this role. The finale, where Kirk inevitably defeats M-5, was well handled; it was nice that he did it by appealing to the its humanity rather than creating a clichéd paradox. Overall a quality episode with both action and character led drama.",8

8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Ultimate Computer (TV Episode 1968)",Captain Dunsel--not on your life,"This is, in my view, the last outstanding show of Star Trek's second season--although I respect 'Bread and Circuses' immensely. Its theme--man vs machine--is transparent. It must have hurt Kirk's ego immensely at the first half of the show when Bob Wesley--the M5's counterpart in the Federation's first wargame--compliments M5 on its exemplary performance. Wesley then calls Kirk 'Captain Dunsel' which was a term that denoted a part which serves no useful purposes. The M5 reacts, maneuvers and fires faster than any human operated ship. Kirk must have felt that starship captains were slowly becoming obsolete while Dr. Daystrom's new invention was the wave of the future. But as Kirk notes, while only a fool stands in the way of science, he intuitively suspects that the M5 cannot replace the job of a starship captain--the job is simply too complex even for one computer. Prior to the second wargame, the M5 multitronic unit starts to behave erratically and overreacts by blasting an unmanned tanker to bits. Soon, the mood changes swiftly as Kirk realizes that Dr. Daystrom, a mentally unstable and frustrated genius, has unleashed a monster in the M5 which will wipe out all ships in its vicinity--i.e. the Federation's equivalent of the Doomsday Machine.When the wargames resume, Kirk and his crew of 20 knows the M5 doesn't realise that this is only a drill or a test of its abilities, rather than a real war. The M5 uses 100% laser power to attack its targets in the exercise: the USS Potemkin, Lexington, Excalibur and another ship. The M5 destroys the USS Excalibur with the loss of hundreds of crewmen. Kirk must then stop the M5 before it eliminates the USS Lexington and its commander Bob Wesley, Kirk's friend. Suddenly, you realise that Wesley's comments about Kirk being a dunsel is completely out to lunch. As Kirk observes, if the USS Lexington took on the M5, the Lexington would be swiftly destroyed since the M5's reaction time is superior to that of any human operated starship. Wesley's life rests in the hands of the man he ridiculed earlier: captain Kirk! This is a sophisticated tale of a computer gone bad with a twist: unlike the 1983 movie 'Wargames', the M5 behaves erratically and is inherently unstable since it has been pre-programmed with Dr. Daystrom's endgrams within it. Spock perceptively realises that the M5 ""is not behaving in a logical manner"" and more like an emotional human being when he notes that the machine is using far more power than is normal for its tasks even though no questions or programs have been inputed into it. So, the M5 is Daystrom's baby right down to the doctor's brain synapses!There is just one intriguing scenario which this show does not mention. If Daystrom was a far more balanced individual, would the M5 have performed flawlessly in both its wargame sequences and thus presented a compelling case for eliminating the need for starship captains...i.e. essentially thrust Kirk out of his job? That's a question this show cannot attempt to answer. Overall, the Ultimate Computer is a brilliantly produced episode with fine performances by Kirk and Daystrom. It was perhaps the last perfect episode of season 2 of Star Trek.",10
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Ultimate Computer (TV Episode 1968)",Daystrom's Dilemma,"This is a rather complex episode. It has the classic question as to whether complete mechanization (including a master computer) is preferable to a human (or non-human) crew. A man named Dr. Daystrom is one of the pioneers in the development of space technology. He was once lauded but, like so many pioneers, has become the object of the public's malaise over past accomplishments. He uses the Enterprise as his Guinea pig, installing his ultimate computer and putting the crew in menial positions. To test out his baby, Daystrom has arranged war games with other starships. The computer does a masterful job of running the ship, but because artificial intelligence lacks imagination, when the games commence, the thing can't distinguish the game from reality. It believes these ships are actually attacking it. Daystrom goes mad when efforts are made to stop his creation. Another issue is if Daystrom has his way, there will be no more crews, no more explorations. Would it spell the end of the need for looking into the unknown.",7
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Ultimate Computer (TV Episode 1968)","ultimately, pretty good","'The Ultimate Computer' is an above-average episode of 'Star Trek' and benefits greatly by the presence of William H. Marshall as Dr. Richard Daystrom, a brilliant computer expert. Marshall is an imposing figure, six foot five, with a marvelously deep bass voice. He is quite convincing, both in the early going as a somewhat vain inventor, and even more so later, when it appears he is going mad. Daystrom's latest project, the M-5 computer, is to be tested on the Enterprise. Its purpose, simply put, is to replace man in most areas of ship operation, particularly the captain. Kirk, as one might imagine, is less than thrilled at the prospect but reluctantly goes along. At first, the M-5 performs well at a number of routine tasks, executing them faster than a human crew could. But then things start to go wrong, culminating in a series of 'war games' with other starships that the M-5 treats as the real thing, firing on and crippling the other ships with full phasers. It won't allow itself to be 'turned off,' so Kirk must instead rely on the time-tested technique of talking it to death. While well-paced and decently written (by D.C Fontana and Laurence Wolf), 'The Ultimate Computer' sees Kirk unnecessarily belittled by a fellow officer, and then even blamed for the murderous attacks by the same officer later. (Does it never occur to Commodore Wesley that maybe, just maybe, the M-5 might be responsible, since it is being tested?) That aside, this is a fine entry in the series and stands as an example of the show when it was at a peak of creativity and consistency.",7

Back then, computers were so expensive, only corporations owned them. And it wasn't just the misinformed who gave computers more respect than they were due. Artificial Intelligence researchers believed that they would soon be matching human reasoning. Such power in the hands of a few was of course a frightening prospect.Daystrom's best moments are at 29 and 42 minutes on the DVD.",

It's neat that Roddenberry, in line with his (very appropriate) dedication to racial equality, cast Dr. Daystrom as a very capable, intellectual (if seriously unbalanced) black scientist. Also very engaging to take the action inside ANOTHER Federation starship, that of Wesley. Now there's a key difference between the M5 System and HAL, the evil AI which appeared almost simultaneously: they both end up being homicidal, but only the M5 can vaporize anyone who tries to disconnect it.",9

14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Ultimate Computer (TV Episode 1968)","""There are certain things men must do to remain men"".","It was probably inevitable that Captain Kirk and the Enterprise crew would some day have to come up against a superior non-human intellect. What better challenge than to engage in a battle of wits against the 'Ultimate Computer'? The episode introduces Dr. Richard Daystrom (William Marshall), developer of the M-5 Multitronic Unit, capable of running an entire starship bereft of crew. With that premise, the story is quite literally an opportunity to beg the question - be careful what you wish for - as it comes face to face with with the law of unintended consequences. The M-5 is so peerless that it makes life and death decisions in fractions of a second so quickly, that the negative repercussions of it's actions are felt only when it's too late.As with many stories, not only Star Trek but other TV programs as well, one never gets to see what happens once the show is over. What for example, does the Federation do about Daystrom run amok, his multitronic gizmo slaughtering a few hundred starship crew while severely damaging a number of ships themselves. By the end of the story, Kirk and the rest are pretty much back to normal, but what about the consequences? I know, it's only a TV show, but I wind up thinking about stuff like that.Within the Star Trek universe though, this was a fairly intelligent and suspenseful episode. However the one thing that bothered me was Commodore Wesley's (Barry Russo) trusting nature and willingness to be compassionate. Kirk was sharp enough to drop his defenses as if playing dead, but what if M-5 had come up with that strategy? Not that I would have wanted the Enterprise to be destroyed, but Wesley's judgment didn't seem to conform to the reality of his situation.Well we've seen it before, as the Captain defeats M-5 with a little bit of logic by appealing to it's humanistic programming (Ep. #2.3 - The Changeling). He gets to prove he's no Captain Dunsel, and off screen, I'm sure he celebrated with a little bit of that good old Finagle's Folly.",8

In this episode he showed that he could act--particularly when it was obvious that his character was mentally ill. However, Mr. Marshall didn't get that many chances to act in decent films and it's a shame because he was talented. But, despite this, not a whole lot stands out to recommend it.The episode is about the testing of a new automated computer system intended to make human space piloting practically obsolete--as the ship would have autonomous control and handle everything--doing it even better than humans could. However, Dr. Daystrom's system is far from perfect, as it has difficulty distinguishing friend from foe in the mock battles and begins actually destroying Federation ships! Much of this appears to be due to the fact that the system's creator was actually imbalanced! The acting and writing aren't bad, but the episode does suffer some for being pretty static--as all the action takes place on the ship. While not bad, it's also not particularly memorable.",7

The M-5 is installed to partake in war games against other starships. The system's creator, Dr. Richard Daystrom, comes aboard to check on things as a skeleton crew sits and watches the M-5 operate.The AI's machine learning is based off of Daystrom and his ideas and soon things go a bit haywire. The M-5 destroys an unmanned freighter and kills a crewman attempting to shut off the system. Soon, not even its creator can control it. It attacks the other starships in earnest; Daystrom watches as his baby becomes a harbinger of death.In classic Kirk fashion, the captain is able to outwit the machine, convincing it that the murders it has committed means it must put itself to death. The M-5 turns itself off and Kirk takes back control just in time; the other starships were about to destroy the Enterprise for good. A distraught Daystrom can't cope with the failure of his perfect system. Some things can't be left to technology; they need a human touch.The Enterprise has dealt with a lot of AI systems by this point so Kirk is now the leading expert in outdueling these guys. This might be his greatest foil though. The M-5 is not only his archrival, it is his replacement. It is the future; it causes him to question his entire existence and role as a starship captain. This is something that many people (back then as well as now) can relate to. As technology becomes more sophisticated, many of the skills and jobs of the past become obsolete. This fear drives us to reject some advancements in society. But are they always advancements?Clearly not in this episode. The moral here is soothing to mankind: technology can never replace our empathy or what makes us human. You can try to make androids, you can try to automate everything, but there's that little something special about us that separates us from other lifeforms and other creations.",8

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. After a good run on its first season, the second season has more expectations to fulfill and hopefully they will try to develop the character a bit more and focus on the relations between the crew members on the enterprise to blend in and communicate easily with the audience despite of just focusing on more mind-numb missions that sometimes feel like they are filling their time and work in.The Ultimate Computer certainly has a newer structure and doesn't quite go as predicted having said that, it still doesn't mean it is engaging or better than others but the conversations are intriguing and amusing especially Spock's input that Kirk is always enthusiast about.",

On one side we find McCoy and Kirk against the computer with the obvious machine hating McCoy on the far side and Kirk a little closer to the middle. On the other side we have Daystrom and Spock who marvel at what computers can do and look to them as the future of space travel. Daystrom, like McCoy, is on the far but opposite side in support of the computer. The struggles of these two differing points of view are evidenced by the conversations between Kirk and McCoy and the acting of our weekly guest star. Their constant back and forth is what makes this episode good, and by the end it helps us realize that the truth is somewhere in the middle.

The tall, commanding Marshall gets to show nice range as a man much more complex than your typical heavy.",8
22,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Ultimate Computer (TV Episode 1968)","Could be a stage play, perhaps?","I've seen this episode at least once every decade since the '80s, and it seems we're getting closer to the possibility of computers gaining their own 'mind' in reality. In fantasy, there's HAL from 2001:A Space Odyssey (soon after this was broadcast), War Games, and the basis of the Terminator franchise, but I can't think of anything before this (though I acknowledge another review has mentioned something from the '50s).The stage play thought sprang to mind after hearing William Marshall's sonorous delivery, and today, perhaps the story could be lengthened and the tech made aesthetically more up-to-date, though not a lot more to update- they're way ahead of the time as so often on Trek. Today's technology could provide some great live visuals, while of course, hopefully not trying to take over the performance.Anyway, enough of my pipe dreams. Here, a great show from our three leads with their unique chemistry, Scotty despairs the only way he knows how, and Chekov gives us a ""wessels"". But, to hear William Marshall say ""Revolution"" is a treat.Also, Spock's humorous little put-down of McCoy's ""torrential flood of illogic"" at the end is highly memorable.",9
23,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Ultimate Computer (TV Episode 1968)",The Ultimate Computer,"All I ask for is a tall ship and a star to steer her by.The question: how do you outsmart a computer with ""human sensibilities"" and total control of a galaxy class starship? The M-5 computer, designed by the brilliant mind of Dr. Daystrom (Blacula himself, William Marshall ), has been built with a brain similar to humans, with the circuitry to think and react faster than humans. Every living thing wants to survive: this is a comment by Spock and the M-5 is no different, Daystrom established this while building it after the first four computers were failures, with malfunctions that should have forewarned what would happen on board the Enterprise. When ""feeling threatened"" by other starships during what was meant to be test exercises (called wargames), the M-5 computer attacks them (the first sign of trouble was when the M-5 destroys a crew-less, robotically controlled old-age freighter), leaving one derelict, the crew dead (the Excaliber), another badly damaged with multiple fatalities (the Lexington). Kirk finds that several efforts to cut its power are unsuccessful, so communicating with it by having the M-5 consider its responsibility in the murder of many human lives may be the only alternative he has left. This is truly the magic of Star Trek at its absolute best, confronting issues regarding man's dependency on machines, the idea that humans can be replaced by machines, the difficulty in examining one's legacy when under close scrutiny, the value in how one does his job, and how to handle a catastrophic situation when few options are available. This is also a triumph in how we see Captain James Tiberius Kirk encounter complications of an extraordinary nature (he is considered by a superior in charge of the wargames as ""no longer needed"", and we see Kirk go numb and devastated by this), such as watching ships being attacked by phaser fire, unable to stop his own ship from doing so, or a member of his own crew killed because he was ""in the way"" in Engineering (nearly also killing Scotty!). Seeing Kirk debating his own worth and examining the feelings of recognition in what it exactly entails being the Captain of a glamorous ship, entitled with prestige and grandeur, is truly compelling. Conversations with Bones and Spock illustrate how Kirk looks at the idea of machines taking the positions once occupied by humans, how people lose their posts every day, and how the Captain himself might not be any different than those in the past rendered ""obsolete"" and no longer required. Also fascinating is seeing a genius, Daystrom, slowly crumble under the weight of the failure of his creation, his psychological state deteriorating into insanity due to the lives lost (he has emphatically stated his mission was for human lives to be *saved* through the use of machines replacing them). Marvelous Trek is always welcome in my living room, and ""The Ultimate Computer"" was an absolute pleasure to sit through. The beauty of this episode in regards to the relationship between Spock and Kirk (and the dynamic of Spock and Bones, always debating human emotion) is how they view the notion of being under the command of a machine instead of a human (or humanoid), determining which would be better, and defining the reasons why.",10
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Bread and Circuses (TV Episode 1968)",The Romans have always been the Strongest,"By this point, we begin to see a pattern in Roddenberry's approach to Trek science fiction; he's not interested so much in cosmic concepts as he is in addressing social & political concerns of the present day through the filter of the Trek universe. He's not concerned with believable science fiction concepts in presenting other worlds which should have very different evolutionary stages from our own history. Hence, we've had the virus-stained 'Satan Bug/Omega Man world' (""Miri""), 'gangster world' (""A Piece of the Action"" - admittedly a comedy), Nazi world (""Patterns of Force"") and 'World War III world' (""Omega Glory""), all just like our own Earth except for a shift in their history to differentiate them. The proper way was to present stories in a parallel universe, but this was a space travel show, so Roddenberry was kind of stuck by his own premise (he includes a brief mention of 'Hodgkin's Law' here to explain the parallel development). Now we have 'Roman Empire' world, a rather effective precursor to the films ""Westworld"" and ""Rollerball"" - the title refers to keeping the populace, the mob, satiated with blood sports.On this world, the Roman Empire never fell, as if continuing for several hundred more years rather than falling apart as it did on our Earth in the 4th - 5th centuries. Gladiatoral combat is on display again (not as silly as in ""Gamesters of Triskelion""), now shown on TV rather than the old-time arenas. Cops or Centurians run around with machine guns, wearing motorcycle helmets (see also ""Soylent Green"" in 1973), but still have swords for the sake of tradition. Slavery has evolved, as well, with most slaves complacent due to an extension of some meager benefits over the centuries (again, a more effective presentation than the cheesy ""Gamesters...""). Quite a few concepts were thought out, including some commentary on religion, and most of it comes across as a serious, adult approach. Indeed, there's a coarseness to much of this episode, an edge, reflecting the cruelty of the culture - this empire was a much earlier version of the brutal Nazi regime, after all.As we've become accustomed to by now, the main trio (Kirk,Spock,McCoy) are the ones who beam down to muck about in this intriguing yet dangerous culture. What comes as a surprise is that they actually adhere to the precepts of their Prime Directive in this one and it shows how tough this directive can be - ironic as this was the time I was kind of hoping Kirk would decide non-interference be damned (again) and lay waste to a city or two in teaching that fat proconsul a lesson in power; the episode succeeds in repelling the viewer to such an extent with all the unpleasantness on this planet that you wouldn't mind the Enterprise 'going Roman' on a few key establishments. The edginess extends to the Spock-McCoy relationship, in that fateful scene when McCoy spells out Spock's fear of living in their jail cell (both appear to accept that death is inevitable for them this time - it is that grim); McCoy's verbal attack appears to be a personal triumph for him but is he so successful at it because he knows what a death wish is like? The scene recalls their tension in ""The Immunity Syndrome.""",8
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Bread and Circuses (TV Episode 1968)",Establishing the Prime Directive,"Although Star Trek's ""Prime Directive"" had been mentioned in episodes prior to ""Bread and Circuses"", that philosophical tenet of the Star Trek universe is the focus of this episode, where it is fully laid out for the first time.Captain Kirk and crew happen upon--what else--an Earth-like planet where Spock's research shows that another Starfleet ship was supposedly destroyed. Oddly, the planet also happens to have exactly the same land to water ratio as the Earth as well as the same chemical composition of air. Before beaming down they also intercept broadcasts that show the civilization to be a close parallel to ancient Rome--particularly in terms of a proclivity towards violence, including violence as entertainment. Of course, once they beam down, Kirk, Spock and McCoy end up as captives.Enter the prime directive. There are probably not many reading this who are not familiar with it, but in a nutshell, it's a Starfleet philosophy of non-interference. In the course of their explorations, the aim is to study other civilizations, but to not take any actions which might amount to culture shock, and even more strongly, to not take any actions which might catalyze socio-cultural development in any directions other than what they would have been without interaction with Starfleet. Of course, there are a lot of problems with this idea, and even within the Star Trek world, Starfleet members are hardly consistent in applying the principle. We can safely guess that Star Trek writers tended to not be very familiar with ideas in science and philosophy of science which posit that any outsider interaction will necessarily affect the cultures being studied in some way, and they probably weren't very familiar with either chaos theory and the butterfly effect, or even Eugene Wigner's interpretation of quantum mechanics (in which the observer and his/her consciousness plays a significant role in the events that occur). But soundness of the Prime Directive in the real world aside, we receive a lesson in what it is and what it means to the Star Trek crew in ""Bread and Circuses"".To an extent, I have to wonder if the Prime Directive wasn't further developed here in the way that it was merely as a plot device. It's a way of extending the conflict. Otherwise, the tendency is to think, ""Why wouldn't Scotty send down crew members to just blast the hell out of Kirk, Spock and McCoy's captors?"" Although the primitive culture had guns, they are still a primitive culture.But it doesn't really matter if the Prime Directive is just a means of extending the dilemma for 40 minutes or so. The Prime Directive is a good idea; one that we can pretend is more sound in the Star Trek universe, and one that proved to be fruitful for many future episodes in different Star Trek series.So this episode is both important and enjoyable. We get some different locations, some interesting one-time ideas--especially the televised gladiatorial events, and I always get a kick out of the fighting episodes. Part of the original Star Trek's charm is its cheesiness, and physical combat is one of the primary sources of cheese. Also notable are the unusual references to religion--this happens a few times in the series, but nowhere more strongly than this episode. There is also a lot of exquisite bickering between Spock and McCoy here, including McCoy mocking Spock's penchant for logic by making his own Spock-like statements and Spock responding by insulting McCoy's medical ability.",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Bread and Circuses (TV Episode 1968)",Simply the best Star Trek parable ever,"This is one of the more violent and grim Trek stories from the original series. Whenever any story is overly unpleasant, the viewer (or reader) has to ask himself a) is the story good enough to make it worth dealing with the unpleasantness throughout and b) is the violence simply gratuitous or is it an integral part of the story? My answers are a definite yes to the first and the latter to the second.The story begins as the Enterprise comes across wreckage from the SS Beagle, a Federation space ship which had disappeared six years earlier. Following the path of the wreckage, Kirk and company discover a planet remarkably similar to Earth, not only in atmosphere and land to water ratios, but in social evolution..well, almost. As they intercept a TV newscast, the bridge crew looks on in horror at a 20th century Rome, complete with institutionalized slavery and televised gladiator matches.There are a number of elements to the story, some of them gut wrenching. Kirk is forced to watch as Spock and McCoy are sent to fight in the arena. Yet unlike the cowardly Captain Merik, the commander of the Beagle who sent his own men to die in the arena to save his own skin and obtain a high political position, Kirk will not hand his ship's crew over to the proconsul, Claudius Marcus, even though refusing to do so means certain death for all three of them. You see just how brave and gallant Captain Kirk really is when held up next to Merik, who for most of the episode is nothing but a pathetic craven coward. The contrast becomes quite evident to Claudius, who in one telling scene asks Merik to leave the two of them alone, stating that the thoughts of one man to another ""couldn't possibly interest you.""Another element this episode explores is the spread of Christianity (""Son"" worship) in Rome, which for some reason was successfully suppressed in this version of Rome until some 1600 years later than the one on earth. It hints that Christianity brought down the empire, although in truth there was much more to it (not going into an all out history lesson here) You see the complexities of the relationship between McCoy and Spock on display as well. The two of them snipe at each other in the jail cell, yet Spock risks his neck to save McCoy's life in the arena.One aspect I find interesting (and disturbing) is not how this 20th century Rome is differs from our modern society, but the way the two, in fact, parallel each other. Rome fell essentially because it got fat, lazy, and complacent. The socio/political philosophy of ""bread and circuses"" is really the same today as it was then. Keep the people fed and entertained. For example, the ""modern"" Rome had televised gladiator matches. We have football and boxing. Granted, people don't often get killed from these things, but the point here is the entertainment factor from seeing people beat the you-know-what out of one another. Food for thought.There's also the issue of that pesky prime directive once again (OK, I actually defend Kirk when he's ""violated"" the prime directive for the simple reason that there never seemed to be a consistent set of guidelines for when it was supposed to be applied, but I digress). In this particular situation, the prime directive was in force, and Kirk wouldn't violate it even if it meant death for him and his two closest friends. (you got the idea he REALLY would have liked to though).Part of the reason Roddenberry gave for doing Star Trek in the first place was that he wanted to talk about things that the network censors at the time wouldn't let him talk about (i.e. sex, war, politics, religion), and he saw telling these stories using ""polka dotted people from a far off planet"" as a way of getting past the censors. Never did he do a better job of that than in this episode. Again, Bread and Circuses (written by Roddenberry and Gene Coon) is violent (although tame by today's standards) and very grim, but it's a very intense and well crafted story with great dialogue, acting, character development, and some good action sequences thrown in.And it makes you think.",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Bread and Circuses (TV Episode 1968)",One of the Best Trek Earth Parallel stories,"'Bread and Circuses', production #43 was one of the last episodes made by Gene L. Coon himself who left the second season of Star Trek after 'A Private Little War.' (production #45.) The entire premise of this show was different from other Trek-Earth parallel stories such as 'Who Mourns for Adonis', or the subpar 'Plato's Stepchildren'. Here, captain Merik of the USS Beagle actually obeys the Federation's prime directive and avoids cross-cultural contamination with the inhabitants of planet 892-IV, a carbon copy of the ancient Romans when he orders his personnel to beam down to the planet--and essentially die. The head of the Romans, the cruel and vindictive Claudius Marcus, knows all about the Federation and its prime directive of non-interference. Bread and Circuses is an obvious what if: if the Roman Empire had survived into the 23rd century, what would life have been like today? Savage gladiatorial duels are now transmitted on live TV and dissident ""sun worshippers"" are shown resisting the regime. We have a classic McCoy-Spock interaction in the slave pens and the Trek trio including captain Kirk know that they all face certain death unless they violate the prime directive. Kirk--while threatened at gunpoint--still deliberately refuses to betray his own crew by ordering them to transport themselves down to the planet and instead uses the word ""condition green"" to Scotty to signal that his party are in trouble but the Enterprise musn't rescue them. Everyone obeys the prime directive which seemingly condemns the Trek trio to a painful death.Roddenberry nicely lays out his conception of how slaves in our modern world would function while the Roman guards are equipped with both modern machine guns as well as ancient daggers to honour the memory of their predecessors. In the end, Kirk, Spock and McCoy are saved from death in the arena by the traitorous Merik himself who tells Scotty to home in on the communicator's general coordinates and beam the trio up. Merik is rewarded for his bravery by being stabbed to death by Marcus while Kirk, Spock and McCoy narrowly miss being machine gunned to death when Scotty beams them up in time. There are several classic lines in this show including one to the dissident gladiators and sunworshipper Flavius that if he brought down the show's ratings: ""We'll do a special on you."" This episode was a tense tightly wound story by Gene L. Coon and since Coon was one of my favourite Star Trek producers, I highly recommend it. There are many great production values here.",9
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Bread and Circuses (TV Episode 1968)",They threw me a few curves...,"Though tempted to rate this episode with one star for reasons to be discussed, I give it three stars. I add one star because, well, it's Trek, so even bad episodes are fun and this one had some nice moments. I give it another star just because of Kirk's punchline, ""They threw me a few curves..."", a reference to the gift provided him by the Proconsul. That was a rare moment of ""inside"" humor during an otherwise self-important episode.The concept of a parallel planet was already well worn before this episode, and if you were still watching Trek at this point, then by definition you were forgiving of the absurdity of it all. One might suspend disbelief long enough to accept a single near-Earth parallel (Miri), but by the fourth or fifth time that such a parallel is found, not only within the same galaxy, but by the same crew and captain, surely it pushes the notion fully into cheesehood. Similarly, we can suspend disbelief on the fact that the inhabitants speak perfect colloquial 1960's English, regardless of their location and period of development - it would be difficult to sustain a weekly one our drama without this concession. However, the painful exposition where the normally logical Spock makes a point of the native use of English, not once, but twice, completely breaks down the fourth wall. Further painful exposition occurs when the entire landing party recounts the points of the Prime Directive, which of course they already know. Yes, it's done to aid the viewing audience, but a better way could have been devised to give out that information. In any event, even after making a big deal about it, Kirk almost immediately violates the Prime Directive (I'm amused by reviewers who seem to claim that the opposite - that this episode grandly upholds the Prime Directive), demonstrating his communicator to the locals, and asking them if they've heard stories about men from other worlds coming from those lights in the sky. This is almost immediately after McCoy carefully explains that they are forbidden to even hint at the existence of other worlds. Then later, Kirk is squeamish about contaminating the Proconsul (catching himself from talk of beaming down), although the Proconsul has already been thoroughly contaminated by Merrick, and already knows all about Vulcans, the Federation, communicators, and phasers. Kirk even mentions to the Proconsul that he could bring down 100 men with phasers, bare moments after being shy about using the word ""beam"". What? How stupid can this dialog be? But all of that is forgivable because it is Trek, and Trek is good even when it's bad.Where this episode really jumps the shark is in the obnoxious attempt to promote Christianity. It was a nice idea that the Roman empire could be brought down by a modern notion of freedom, rights, and equality. Whatever that has to do with Christianity is beyond my comprehension. Kirk says, ""Wouldn't it be something to be able to watch it happen all over again?"" What? The Crusades? The Inquisition? The Dark Ages? Christianity was a tool for killing, oppression of people, and suppression of ideas for centuries. The suggestion that the main concept was anti-violence is historical balderdash. It's appealing and appeasing to True Believers, sure enough, but it's an insult to the intelligence of anyone who is not so brainwashed as to have no understanding of actual historical fact.Further, the Romans were not brought down by Christians. Long before the Roman Empire finally fell apart, Christianity had become its mandated state religion. The collapse was brought about by a combination of internal corruption, along with relentless external attack from pagan barbarian hordes.For practical reasons, we must accept the illogic of yet another parallel development and the appearance of English in an alien world, but we should not have to accept such an egregious and unnecessary misrepresentation of cultural and religious history and the saccharin delivery of religious dogma. The fourth wall is not just breached, but blasted away by photon torpedoes. Further, such hackery was not essential to the story and actually detracted from it. One gets the feeling that the writer spent all that time hacking out a story merely to lead up to Uhura's revelation of ""son vs sun"", which is lazy and disappointing. It's quite obvious on repeated viewing that the dialog and even the scene imagery were carefully selected to try to set up Uhura's revelation as a surprise ending. What could have been a strong story on modern concepts of freedom and democracy battling against a modern version of the decadent and oppressive Roman Empire, instead was delivered as a ridiculous pandering to the religious bigotry of its day. Hence, the episode ends up being quite dated and silly in a modern viewing, and will age badly in decades to come.",3
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Bread and Circuses (TV Episode 1968)",A Tragic Ending Worthy of Conrad,"What makes this episode memorable to me after nearly forty years is not the tired, clumsy gladiator swordfights -- and certainly not the historically dubious tributes to Christianity as a religion of peace.The power of this episode actually comes from the backstory of the minor villain, Merrick aka ""Mericus."" The real theme of this episode is the redemption of a man who once dreamed of being a Starship Captain, like Kirk, but was doomed by a single moment of cowardice to a lifetime of self-loathing. This is basically a retelling of LORD JIM by Joseph Conrad, with perhaps a dash of THE SHORT HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCES MACOMBER by Ernest Hemingway.The clues come right away that Merrick is disgusted with himself. He's supposed to be questioning Kirk but really he's the one begging to be heard out, to be absolved. ""Lots to talk about, Jim. Lots to explain."" Later, when Kirk is absolutely ice-cold under pressure, watching Spock and McCoy face death in the arena, Merrick helpfully points out, ""Proconsul, he commands not only a space ship, but a star ship. A very special ship, and crew. I once tried for such a command."" Poor Merrick does everything but break down and bawl here. ""I coulda been a contendah!"" The truly vile specimen in this episode is the proconsul, a fat little man who never gets tired of rubbing salt in Merrick's wounds. Watch how he makes Merrick pat Kirk down for weapons like a flunky. And listen for that little dig, ""the thoughts of one man to another cannot possibly interest you, Merrick."" All this stuff is a lot more hateful -- and closer to everyday life for most of us -- than sending men to die in the arena. And it's all the more grim in that this repulsive punk of a proconsul is still alive at the end, and will presumably live to die in bed, evil and unpunished. Tough stuff.But in the end, what real uplift this episode provides is not Uhura's asinine speech about ""The Son"" but watching Merrick grab that communicator and shout, ""Enterprise, lock on to this transmission. Three to beam up -- ACK!!!!"" Merrick lived a coward, but dies a hero -- in a tragic ending worthy of Conrad.",6
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Bread and Circuses (TV Episode 1968)","""It's not the sun up in the sky. It's the ...""","Communication's officer Lieutenant Uhura sums up the decline and fall of the Roman Empire as the world knows it. The plot is really secondary. It's there to drive the story forward, but the underlying theme tells of the human condition via a reign of pure strength, and its ultimate failure.This theme is reinforced by one of the supporting characters, an escaped 20th century Roman gladiator, Flavius, and his ultimate sacrifice. He represents the old way, once reformed, but gone back to the rule of Rome by fighting the Romans the only way he knows how.The basic story is a rescue mission, but the real story is the heartfelt examination of the futility of a society that relies on a slave class to sustain itself on all levels, even down to bloody gladiatorial games as entertainment. Kirk is put through the rigors of experiencing both the pains and pleasures of such a society, and although he understands that he cannot change this world, he does help reinforce the message that will ultimately alter it and its Roman Empire on the most fundamental level.Note Kirk's line as he talks to Flavius in the cave and pats him on the shoulder. Attach that to Uhura's summation at the end, and you got yourself the entire story: ""It's not the sun up in the sky. It's the ...""Positives; Kirk scores with a hot blonde. Druscilla is a HOTTIE! At least she was in 1967 :-) If I were the captain of the Enterprise I think I would bend the rules a little and beam her up to the ship before breaking orbit. Heck... I'd deserve it!

His POV was a over-used one in TOS but it certainly worked out here; as was that of Kirk's old classmate turned law breaker. only that is not so over-used. (I can only think of return to tomorrow on that point). By the way, even idiots can mend their mistakes, this one did just in time.In order to fully appreciate this episode you MUST watch the last 3 minutes. it's priceless! 4 of 5 stars. and that's because of the voice-overs, which sucked yet were important to the plot. may the blessings of the SON be upon you.",8

There had been more than the expected number of episodes taking place on Class-M planets, and so many story lines resembling Earth history that the law of averages was being severely tested. This one also rolled out the gladiatorial theme once again, just as it did in #2.1 Amok Time and #2.21 The Gamesters of Triskelion. Not that it's a bad story if approached as a stand-alone, but when watching the shows in succession, the repetition is palpable.The recurring theme that got my attention was Roddenberry's analysis of slavery in the story, and how it evolved into an institution on the planet. He often approached his plots with a subtext of personal freedom and liberty, and in this one he takes a slam at the way government power willingly offers such things as rights to medicine and old age pensions in exchange for those singular blessings. When done incrementally, it's almost never observed until it's too late, and then the citizenry wonders what ever happened. It's a political approach that continues to be tested to the present day.I'm curious how Roddenberry would be accepted (read that not accepted) today for the conclusion voiced by Uhura at the end of this story. Liberal ideology and political correctness would have shouted down even an oblique reference to 'The Son' as it was positioned here. Lost would be the message that all men are brothers, even if that was the basic precept of Christianity.But boy oh boy, Captain Kirk really walked into it this time when he met Drusilla (Lois Jewell). I'm not buying the argument that old Claudius was being generous with his personal slave, but I'm sure the Captain didn't mind. This was definitely one off screen occasion that left no room for doubt what Kirk might have been doing while observing the Prime Directive. He was engaged in a little bit of directive of his own.",7

The guys find themselves in a culture that puts on shows for a television audience based on gladiatorial battles. The problem here is that there seems to be some stasis here, but when they find out some guy named Merik has broken the prime directive, they realize that they must put a stop to it. We know from the outset that our guys are going to end up in that arena, in front of the television cameras, replete with recorded booing and cheering. They must walk a fine line. This is yet another Starfleet citizen going bad (does anyone screen these guys?) and disrupting the order of a developing planet. It also begs the question of a parallel universe.

It's a little different by the time we get to Deep Space Nine, but there at least we see the Prophets really do exist. This episode starts badly when Spock shows surprise that the inhabitants speak English, and there's meaningless talk of parallel evolution - as if a common language would ever develop independently.During the episode it appears that the people are sun worshippers, and this seems at odds with their general sophistication. At the close of this episode Uhura announces that it wasn't the ""sun"" they worship, but the ""Son"", the Son of God. As if this makes things any better! I always remember this laughable ending, and it goes so much against the grain of what Star Trek stands for, that it stands out like a sore thumb. The idea that Christianity can be anything other than a belief local to Earth is ludicrous. What, does God go round all the worlds staging this redemption trick like some touring theatre group?",1
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Bread and Circuses (TV Episode 1968)",Roman Empire Ratmaze,"This has been one of my LEAST-favorite ST episodes since I saw it first-run. There's a number of reasons for it, but the main one is probably that it's what I like to describe as a ""rat-maze"" episode. That is, from the beginning, the main characters find themselves trapped, they're stymied at every turn, nothing they do can get them out of it, and they just--BARELY--escape with their lives at the very end, and in this case, not even thru their own efforts. Even without the arrogance of the Procounsel, the violence and the constant threat of death, that would have already made this one of the most unpleasant episodes in ST history.For a real sense of history regarding the series' development, one should watch B&C in production order. It was actually made before the other ""parallel Earth"" stories (A PIECE OF THE ACTION, PATTERNS OF FORCE, THE OMEGA GLORY), the other ""gladiator"" story (THE GAMESTERS OF TRISKELLION) and the one where McCoy & Spock really get ""personal"" (THE IMMUNITY SYNDROME). As it happens, the 1st ""parallel Earth"" story written was THE OMEGA GLORY (one of the 3 scripts offered as the 2nd pilot), while MIRI was the first made (and if you note the similarities between them, it suggests OMEGA was drastically re-written to become MIRI... but then, sadly, filmed later anyway in its original form). The next ""parallel Earth"" story, RETURN OF THE ARCHONS, only fits that category for its clothing & architecture, but it was the 1st to really make a big deal of ""The Prime Directive"".So Gene Roddenberry repeats himself with another ""parallel Earth"" here, this time noting the continents are different, but making too big a deal about the natives speaking English (when we've already seen countless other aliens speaking English!!!).I'd forgotten Ian Wolfe was in this one as the aged leader of the runaways slaves. He'd return in a more annoying fashion as ""Mr. Atoz"" in ALL OUR YESTERDAYS.Rhodes Reason (brother of lookalike Rex) made an imposing figure as the gladiator-turned-pacifist, forced to fight new friends. His next project after this was as UN submarine Commander Nelson in KING KONG ESCAPES! Logan Ramsey will forever stick in my memory as Claudius, the ruler of this sick, depraved world. He's the other reason I genuinely HATE this story. For all the emphasis on the Prime Directive and ""non-interference"" in a world's development, and his twisting it to his own ends, claiming he wants to avoid ""contamination"" by ""new ideas"", his actions in this story make NO SENSE at all. He's clearly lying thru his teeth. Why? Simple. He wants to force Kirk to beam down all 450 crewmen, to either be assimilated-- or die. 450 of Starfleet's BEST would not simply die easily. If anything, they'd assimilate into the culture... and within a generation, hopelessly CONTAMINATE it with their ""new ideas"". If Claudius REALLY wanted to protect the status quo, he's simply get Kirk, Spock & McCoy to beam back to their ship and get the HELL out of there. After all, aren't they sworn NOT to interfere with his planet?? If you ask me, Claudius was just running out of victims for his gladiator combat TV show. If ever an ""alien"" citizen DESERVED to be vaporized in a phaser blast, I'd say he's it. B******!As for the reference to Christianity, I suspect that may be why B&C was ""held back"" by the network and run next-to-next-to-last. (The listings here and elsewhere tend to be incorrect; FRIDAY'S CHILD, scheduled for December, was the victim of a last-minute pre-emption, and not run until March 22, 1968, a week after B&C!) The same thing happened when WKRP did an episode involving religion; CBS held it back until the end of the summer reruns!",5
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Bread and Circuses (TV Episode 1968)",Too many historical bloomers,"Two things spoil this episode for me. First, the plot line and situation is too close to ""Patterns of Force"" (the Nazi episode). Secondly, there are some notable historical bloomers.""Parallel development""...apparently proved by the fact the ""Romans"" speak English. Shouldn't that be Latin? ""Rome had no sun-worshippers"" (McCoy)... actually, Mithraism (sun-worship) was the biggest religion among the Roman soldiery in the first two centuries AD.Surely they could have afforded a historical consultant!A pity, because there are some nicely ironic touches - I particularly like the commercial breaks during the gladiatorial combats!",5
14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Bread and Circuses (TV Episode 1968)",20th Century Roman Empire,"In ""Bread and Circuses"", the Enterprise investigates the disappearance of a ship, the USS Beagle, whose captain is an old school chum of Kirk's. They discover that the ship has crash-landed on a planet with a parallel development to Earth. It resembles 20th century Earth in many ways but has maintained a Roman-like society, complete with gladiator games, swords, and togas. The Prime Directive dictates that Star Fleet will not interfere with the development of burgeoning societies. Because of this Kirk, Spock, & Bones must head to the surface incognito in order to find their fellow Earthlings and return with them. They find that the cultural has already been contaminated by the Beagle's captain and crew who are in cahoots with the planet's government. The Enterprise's trio are thrown into the gladiator games and must figure out a way to escape back to the Enterprise without interrupting the planet's development.Any of the parallel planet episodes have to be taken with a grain of salt. They're inherently silly and if you want to get any satisfaction out of them, you have to just buy into the premise and deal with it. That being said, this episode comes with a lot of other problems.Instead of just embracing the fact that there maybe parallel planets out there with similar worlds, the writers try way too hard to overexplain their existence and point out the parallels: Spock's quips about how they speak English, the fact that their products all have names derived from our galaxy, their religious movement towards Christianity. All of this really bogs the episode down with expositionary dialogue.I also think that the excuse of the Prime Directive doesn't make any sense in the context of this episode. Everything's already been spoiled by the crew of the Beagle. The government's well aware of the existence of other world's with superior technology. So Kirk's circumlocution feels unnecessary.Now for the good: the satire of the television industry. This still feels relevant today, especially when you consider the reality TV world. The emphasis on ratings, the fake applause, it all works so succinctly. From this perspective, the episode works. Unfortunately, this section doesn't really tie into the plot too well. A better story arc and this episode would be very good.",5
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Bread and Circuses (TV Episode 1968)",Trek guys roman all over history,"This was a pretty cool episode. It followed the tried and true formula of going back into what essentially is an exploration of earth's history. The Romans are more like Nazis but it works pretty well. I was surprised while watching this one last night that I didn't recall ever having seen it before, at least not all of it. This doesn't rate as a classic offering of the first Trek series but it was interesting and fun. The guys encounter an alien society that has patterned itself after ancient Rome, complete with televised gladiator battles to the death. Spock gets a chance to display his nifty swordsmanship while McCoy shows why hes a doctor, not a gladiator(although he does whack one dude with a mean karate chop during a jail escape). Spock has to endure a chopping lecture about being human from McCoy as well. Lots of McCoy in this one kids. Overall, this is not one of the very best episodes but still a ton of fun. Hey, you actually get to see the crew dice up some bad guys with swords at the end. This is absolutely one of the most violent Treks. By far!!!!! Also, Kirk gets to bed down with a sizzling hot slave girl due to the Romans respect for the Captain's ""manliness"". You go Kirk....little wonder the Captain was smiling on the bridge at the end of this one!!!! Whoa",8

Kirk and the gang investigate the disappearance of a crew on a planet which has a modern Roman Empire. There is slaves, power worship of the state, and televised gladiator events. The gem of Bread and Circuses is the dialogue and interaction between Claudius Marcus and Kirk! The rebellion, the persecuted and gladiatorial event are entertaining; Spock saves McCoy with the old Vulcan nerve pinch. How many times Spock has Spock used it? A traitor, a surprise ending and what the rebel are about makes for a great ending. Live Star Trek theater a good vibe episode. Eight out of ten stars.",8

Gene Roddenberry has managed to sneak almost every possible social justice theme you can think of into this episode. Ruling class, slavery, despotism, religion, violence, even Christianity. No shortage of essay topics here.Our trio of heroes beams down to the planet surface after finding space debris, which Captain Kirk learns to be connected to an old friend that *almost* made it through the Academy, but settled for the B team. They beam down, and discover an advanced but very brutal society, complete with television laugh tracks for their death arenas. Our space professionals encounter serious difficulty, but are eventually able to outsmart the locals. You knew that. There is quite a lot of hand to hand fighting here, ho hum. In my opinion, the best part of this episode are the interactions between McCoy and Spock. Kirk allows himself to be plied with wine and apparently gets it on with one of the ladies. I am not sure how that would work out in real life, but hey. This is Gene Roddenberry's script.I enjoyed it. Scotty gets a good role, saving the day with his ingenuity. Overall, it is a better than average episode, despite the repeat gladiator theme.",9

The Enterprise is on it's routine patrol when it runs across some wreckage of the SS Beagle. The Beagle has been lost for 6 years and it's captain was R. M. Merik, a man Kirk once knew. They find no signs of humans so they guessed that the crew was able to leave the ship before it was destroyed. They follow the debris trail to an unknown planet - never charted before. They discover the planet is very much like planet Earth and even pick up radio and video signals from it. The ship's computer picks up survivors from the Beagle on the planet. Kirk, Spock & McCoy beam down to the planet's surface and are soon met with a group of men with shotguns - they are runaway slaves. Kirk, Spock and McCoy befriend the runaway slaves. It is revealed that their slavery is over a belief or dispute of gods: sun god vs other gods. Kirk is looking for Captain Merik the slaves have mentioned a man named Merikus - is it one in the same man? The planet is similar to Earth's ancient Rome but mixed with 20th century Earth and soon they find themselves in a 20th century jail cell while searching for Merik... they soon find Merik. Merik takes them to the pro-council where Merik explains what happened to him, his crew and the Beagle. Later Kirk is made to order some of his crew members down to fight in the old Roman style arena. He tells Mr. Scott code green, all is well. Scotty knows that means trouble, don't interfere but stand by. Kirk refused to bring down his men so Kirk, Spock and McCoy are taken to the arena in a real fight to the death which is broadcasted on television. The Enterprise can pick up television signals which is in their favor but must stand-by under the captain's orders - Scotty cannot send down a landing party but he can do other things from the ship.There are some excellent moments between Spock and McCoy - and we are able to learn a bit more about Mr. Spock.

19,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Bread and Circuses (TV Episode 1968)",Ancient Rome with a 20th Century twist,"Having discovered the wreckage of a star ship commanded by Capt. Merik, somebody Kirk knew in the Academy, the Enterprise heads to the planet near where it was destroyed. Here they find a society whose technology is similar to that of modern Earth but TV broadcasts suggest its social structures are almost identical to ancient Rome, complete with slaves and gladiators. Kirk, Spock and McCoy beam down to look for survivors but are captured by a group fighting for the rights of slaves and 'The People of the Sun'. Believing that the 'First Citizen', Merikus, may be Capt Merik Kirk asks for help getting into the city to meet him. They don local clothing and head into the city with Flavius, a former gladiator, but are once again captured. Merik is indeed Merikus and he tries to force Kirk to bring his crew to the surface; when he refuses he is forced to watch as Spock and McCoy are forced to fight against gladiators.This is an entertaining episode with plenty of good moments; most notably McCoy's struggle to survive in the gladiatorial arena. There are also some flaws that need to be overlooked; it might be possible to accept that modern society could develop like that of ancient Rome but it seems highly unlikely that it would also speak English I don't mean characters speaking English and the viewer assuming that is because of the Universal Translator; Spock clearly states that they speak English. The revelation at the end that the 'sun' worshipped by the rebels is actually the 'son' as in 'Son of God' was also rather obvious and it was shocking that none of the landing party realised this when talking about how Sun worship was the only detail that didn't parallel early Rome! Still the story had a pace that made it fairly easy to overlook these details while watching.",7
20,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Bread and Circuses (TV Episode 1968)","Bread, circuses and more Jesuses coming your way.","Reading comments posted here by rabid, uncritical, and naive Trekkies, one would think that B&C should be watched not for the camp value, the 60s glitz, and the good cast, but for its ""message"" and ""philosophy"". Come on, nerds... Gene Roddenberry was a COP before he started writing, frcrissakes. Don't expect too deep a thought from him on too many issues. Star Trek is a fun, cheerful, sometimes intelligent, sometimes goofy TV show. B&C succeeds far more in the goofy category, however. The idea that Old Rome would develop into a technologically advanced society and still have its gladiator fights and even a Christian-like sect is more than dumb. However, within the confines of the sometimes very silly ST universe, it makes perfect sense. It's important to understand that ST logic and real-life logic aren't always compatible. Most Trekkies seem to think that the world of ST has enough basis in reality to warrant ""deep"" comparisons.Someone on this site complained that the Romans speak English instead of Latin. That is a pathetic remark to make. It just so happens that nearly every ST alien culture speaks English and almost every planet has a breathable, Earth-like atmosphere. So what... That kind of ""criticism"" is far too easy and obvious. It would be like complaining that James Bond solves too many major crises, too easily and usually alone.The ""sun-worshippers""/""son-worshippers"" wordplay is just as cheesy as the whole premise. First of all, the very idea that humankind of the future would travel through space and still believe in God and take religion seriously is hogwash. Secondly, the idea that God would send his ""son"" to every inhabited planet to watch them develop Christianity is mind-blowingly silly. Does that mean that the same Jesus gets crucified every time, or does this God store his multiple Jesuses in warehouses?Is Merrick supposed to be gay? The Roman big chief keeps hinting at that...Did I mention how absolutely awful Deep Space Nine and other ST spin-offs are? You can almost test a person's IQ with this...",
21,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Bread and Circuses (TV Episode 1968)",If Rome had lasted to 1968...,"...It would not have looked like it did in this episode.First off, Deep Space Nine was the best of the 90's Trek Spin-offs- And the only one to do The Original Series homage with the great ""Trials and Tribbleations"" episode from Season 5. Another thing I have to refute right away is the concept that science and religion are somehow at odds and that a civilization with Spaceflight would discard Faith: Not Religion per say, but Faith. If I do not have any problems in my mind with my own Faith in regards to theories like Evolution and The Big Bang which I also believe in as much as I believe in God or Jesus, then there will be more people like me who will start agreeing that if God exists, He does not break His own laws of Physics and He does not Snap His fingers or Play with Dice when He creates something, instead He would plan it out scientifically and He would follow the Laws of the Universe He had laid out. It is a new Mindset that has to be reached by both people who are religious, and scientists as well- There has to be an eventual meeting of the two or else there will never really be any huge breakthroughs, especially in a possible future that is anything like Gene Roddenberry's vision of The Federation.The problem with stories like this and not just this story, but the idea that Rome was somehow ""Evil"" and Barbaric, is due to mostly Catholic Teaching, the same Catholic Teaching I was raised into. But this teaching it is false as I will explain here. Think about it - What happened when the Goths - Not the same Goths that hang out in Nightclubs and listen to the bands ""Bauhaus"" and ""Specimen,"" but real Barbarians who were great at fighting but terrible with Administration- Knocked down Rome and tried to Administrate it? What actually did happen was that they failed and they themselves entered Oblivion, and we ended up with several centuries of The Dark Ages which was the result of Religion but no Science. The same could happen if there were an era of Science but No Faith.And so this Trek episode shows a Parallel Earth which had developed along the lines of our earth, but that Rome had not been knocked down. What was not considered in this story is that if Rome had continued in the direction it was going, it would have been a Catholic State, rather than a Pagan state, because it's final leaders were religious.But let's say that Jesus came even on That earth, which He must have done there as well as Here, and at the same time He appeared Here. He never called for any bloody revolutions, His aim was Peace. He never backed up anybody who was fighting the government of that time, which was Rome, and he actually had harsher words for Hypocritical Priests of His own religion then He had for the Governors of Jerusalem at the time. The Roman State from this episode, also does not take into account that even The United States was just as barbaric but social developments would have happened there as well, a state like Rome would have eventually developed socially to be more like the United States, and slavery and Gladiators would have been abolished.So, this episode has many flaws, mostly due to the thinking of the time and also what was allowed on Television in 1967 and 1968. Despite that, I hold this episode as special to myself, because of my own personal Faith and this was the only time in The Original Series where my Faith was saluted. IN the 60's, you could not use blatant references to religion like can happen with Today's television, and possibly the word ""Jesus"" was a network taboo. And so Gene Roddenberry went behind the backs of all of those taboos and brought us this episode, it really is one of the best of Season 2, and mostly it is less about Faith than about breaking The Prime Directive - For any reason. And so I blame ""The Fall of The Roman Empire"" in this episode on Captain Merrick (William Smithers) and his blatant defiling of The Prime Directive - Not on Slaves staging a religious revolt. This episode shows the ultimate tragedy of not adhering to Starfleet's number one rule - a Whole world government was taken down and a bloody revolution was begun resulting in a possible Dark Ages for that planet.",10

They are taken hostage by the planet's leader, a despot determined to make sure the Enterprise crew never gets back home to tell anybody about the existence of this society. This society is like a cross between Ancient Rome and 20th century American in that it has televised gladiator fights, and slaves and cars existing side by side. While the despot threatens Kirk and Company's lives, there stands on the sidelines the captain of the crew they had come to find. He sides with the despot. Or does he? This is a perfectly adequate action episode that simply suffers from the sheer goofiness of its premise: the planet that just happens to have a lot of stylistic similarities to Ancient Rome.It has a lot going for it: three very interesting guest characters: the sleazy, xenophobic despot who extols ideals of violence and domination, the cowardly ex-captain who has allowed himself to become the despot's dog, and the escaped slave-gladiator who insists he is now a peace-loving sun worshipper but is forced back into the arena. And the episode features some of the best interaction between Spock and McCoy of the whole series. And watch the scene were Kirk, Claudius, and Merrick engage in a subtle battle of wits and world views while McCoy and Spock are fighting.But the characters, especially the slave-gladiator, do not get enough coverage to be completely meaningful, and the battle of world views between Kirk and his two foes could have been developed a little more to make a really satisfying, thought-provoking episode. And again, that whole Ancient Rome premise is just too far-fetched and distracting to be overlooked. Couldn't they have just done this episode as being about a fight-loving, TV-hooked society and cut out the Ancient Rome thing altogether? So yes, it's good. But it's imperfect.",7
23,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Bread and Circuses (TV Episode 1968)",Kind of interesting but also kind of heavy-handed,"In this episode, the landing party goes in search of survivors from a crashed star ship.

So, instead of the usual gladiator games, it's a televised event! And, in addition, the Romans have modern weapons like machine guns. Despite all this weirdness, one big question remains--what happened to this other crew?! The episode is quite daring taking on such a bizarre and hard to stomach idea of a parallel world with modern Romans and their barbaric ways. Because of this, it certainly is very entertaining but also pretty dumb. This is another great example of an episode where it's best you don't think too much--just sit back and enjoy.",7
24,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Bread and Circuses (TV Episode 1968)",Star Trek: The Original Series - Bread and Circuses,"While ""Breads and Circuses"" once again has Kirk dealing with a gladiatorial situation, this time with Spock and Bones stuck in a ""televised"" combat against ""empire Roman soldiers"" while he must watch. After finding the residue of Federation ship once captained by Merik (William Smithers), Kirk, Spock, and Bones beam down to the Earth-like planet that vessel had possibly orbited. What the three encounter is a 20th Century world quite similar to Earth's own history except the slavery of Rome hadn't been vanquished, with uniformed soldiers working for a type of emperor aptly named Claudius (Logan Ramsey), rounding up ""disorderlies"" and televising gladiator games for big ratings as television is all the rage. Exploitation in the games comes with some benefits like medical and notoriety. At first, the landing party comes across ""believers of the sun"" who are against the empire and its slavery in favor of freedom and peace. The trio eventually is captured by Claudius thanks in no small part to Merik's own help! Merik was also responsible for bringing his ship's crew to the planet to be participants in the games! The Prime Directive (Starfleet must not interfere in the growth and development of a planet, enforcing their own philosophies onto another evolving civilization) is introduced into a plot again, but Kirk has been known to operate against it at timesthis episode, though, Kirk is very adamant about following it absolutely. Merik's total disregard for it (as Woodward was in ""The Omega Glory"") puts him opposed to Kirk and company. At the side of Claudius, Merik has abandoned his principles, with Kirk, Spock, and Bones faced with either death in the games or execution. I loved the shots at television—included is technical controllers turning dials to reflect fake audience sentiment towards the ups and downs of combat during the games—and the clever jabs at ""the importance in ratings"". Violence as a sport on television is never more prevalent than today, and the popularity of men brutalizing men shows up in commercials all the time for kids to see. A slant on the differences in how other similar planets to Earth go in directions opposite each other is familiarthe whole ""parallel plot"" could be used to reflect the what ifs of our own Earth and how similar planets went in their own developmental path, for better or worse. Spock logically viewing this planet and how it is in many ways superior to how Earth developed itself (giving examples of World Wars), getting Bones all riled up, is quite amusing. Spock and Bones with shields and daggers wanting nothing to do with the combat but having very little choice, arguing back and forth, is probably the best scene of the episode. Bones trying to thank Spock for saving his life and the cold logical response, also getting McCoy riled up, is also quite funny. Kirk gets to make out with yet another servant girl before Claudius prepares him for his death! Claudius belittling Merik which spurns him to find his humanity, Kirk refusing to go down without a fight, a great warrior named Flavius (Rhodes Reason) tiring of being exploited and making a stand that gets him killed, and Scotty cleverly using the means to knock out momentarily the power source that televises the games which allows Kirk to get to his men are other developments that make up this rather underrated episode. The reference to the Son of God might be a bit heavy-handed for some, as Uhura debates Spock on the ""followers of the sun"" as not being some religious superstition.",7
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Assignment: Earth (TV Episode 1968)",1 Of The Best Pilots To Never Fly,"The Enterprise travels back in time to observe Earth during a particularly tumultuous period in it's history. However, upon arriving they intercept a mysterious alien transmission and end up beaming aboard a man wearing a 20th century business suit and carrying a cat. So begins ""Assignment: Earth"", a Star Trek episode that was actually a pilot for a proposed series, a marrying of Ian Flemming's James Bond with Gene Rodenberry's socially relevant themes.Robert Lansing plays Gary Seven, a human trained by an unnamed alien race to protect humanity against threats to world peace. In this story, his mission is to transport to earth and prevent the US from shooting a military satellite into space that could set off a nuclear exchange between the US and the Soviet Union. But when the Enterprise captures Seven en-route to Cape Canaveral, Kirk is reluctant to let him go, fearing Seven's mission may not be as altruistic as he claims. Mr. Seven then escapes the ship, beaming down to the city of Manhattan with Kirk and Spock in hot pursuit. Next we are introduced to Mr. Seven's hapless new secretary, Roberta Lincoln, (played by the unmistakable Terri Garr). Though Roberta is definitely a scene-stealing sidekick, and a quintessential '60's ""dippy blonde"", Rodenberry fleshes her character out having her express concerns, both about her country, and her generation's future during that strife ridden period of the 1960's. Of Garr's performance you can see that even at so young an age (in the episode they state she is 20), her comedic timing was already impeccable and she seemed to have genuine chemistry with Robert Lansing. Lansing is effective here, too, both as an action star, and as a straight man to Garr. His deep voice and those unique, vaguely sinister looking eyes of his made him well suited to play an enigmatic hero. His screen presence reminds one of Patrick Magoohan with an American accent. Rounding out the trio is Mr. Seven's black cat, Isis, which he talks to as if it's purring is actually a language- which it is. Isis, we learn later, is really some sort of alien female in the form of a cat. We only learn this at the end when she reveals a glimpse of her true self in order to tease an already jealous Roberta.""Assignment: Earth"" had some high quality production values including the swanky office apartment Seven worked out of complete with a huge vault that was actually a teleportal like the Enterprise's transporter system. Mr. Seven's weapon of choice was a fountain pen that could short out electrical mechanisms, temporarily neutralize suspicious guards, and, if necessary, kill. His snooty female-voiced super computer looked very much like the M-5 unit from an earlier episode, ""The Ultimate Computer"", but that's okay. It's still a cool prop.Veteran ""Star Trek"" director Marc Daniels keeps things moving at a nice pace and maintains the right balance between the straight-up action and the more comedic aspects of the episode. There is some particularly effective usage of stock footage from NASA, too. The incorporated shots of the rocket being prepped for launch are quite awesome. Overall, as a ""Star Trek"" episode this one is a fine entry. As a pilot however, ""Assignment: Earth"" serves as a tantalizing indication of what might have been a great series. Such a shame it was not picked up by NBC, but then this was also the network that decided to axe ""Star Trek"" after 3 years so, *shrug* guess we shouldn't be all that surprised by this additional boneheaded decision.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Assignment: Earth (TV Episode 1968)",The Enterprise does (effect) current events,"This was one of the more topically relevant episodes when aired. The topicality was helped by the setting--Earth in 1968. It deals with the Cold War arms race, the burgeoning space program (remember that this was before the first man landed on the moon; the first lunar orbit and return, via Apollo 8, would arrive 9 months after this episode aired), and an early version of a satellite-based nuclear defense system, the Sentinel Program, similar to what came to be known by the tag ""Star Wars"" during the Reagan Era.These subjects are broached by again employing a time travel plot. Captain Kirk and crew head back to conduct historical research to ""find out how our planet survived desperate problems in the year 1968"". They intercept a transporter beam (a ""beam down""/""beam up"" signal), and end up bringing on board a strange man in a 1968 business suit holding an even stranger cat. He claims that he's Gary Seven, a human being from the 20th Century, but one who has been living on another planet, far more advanced. He demands to be sent to Earth immediately, and says that if the Enterprise interferes with what he has to do, the Earth will be destroyed, and probably the Enterprise crew, too. He won't give Kirk and company details. However, he does seem to be more advanced, as he relatively easily escapes the Enterprise's security and beams himself down to Manhattan to begin his assignment. Kirk and Spock eventually follow.One of the slight flaws with this episode is that the set-up of both the Enterprise's and Gary Seven's missions is a tad murky. The Enterprise usually doesn't do ""historical research"", and the plot is a fairly transparent way to just do a topical show. As such, it doesn't have the same impact that it would have had in the late 1960s, but on the other hand, it's not as if multilateral weapons build-ups are not a problem any longer. Another oddity is that for much of the episode, Kirk and Spock aren't given much to do. For one extended sequence, they pretty much just stand around and watch. And Scotty shows us one of the worst ""zooming"" systems you could imagine, all thanks to the limitations of the stock footage on hand.Well, it turns out that the motivations for all of the above are explainable by this being effectively a pilot episode for a spin off series, tentatively called ""Assignment Earth"", about Gary Seven (and presumably other agents if the series were bought). Presumably, the spin off show would have been set in a sci-fi present, on Earth. This was the last episode of ""Star Trek's"" second season, and earlier in the year, Star Trek had already been threatened with cancellation. Only a letter writing campaign gained a commitment from NBC for one more year. Roddenberry hoped that if ""Star Trek"" ended up getting axed in the near future, ""Assignment Earth"" would keep him employed. That explains some of the problems this episode has as an episode of ""Star Trek"", but it doesn't exactly excuse them.On the positive side, Assignment Earth has one of the more unique ""Star Trek"" plots. Gary Seven is intriguing--kind of a ""Mission: Impossible"" character with a strong sci-fi twist. Terri Garr plays an unwitting Manhattan secretary who becomes wrapped up in the machinations of Seven, Kirk and Spock and she frequently steals her often-funny scenes. The different, well-known locations are achieved by integrating sets with stock footage, but except for Scotty's zooming, they are very well done, especially for the limited budget available to Rodenberry and crew. This isn't one of the best ""Star Trek"" episodes, but it's good. ""Assignment Earth"" would have been a fun show, had NBC gone for it. As it stands, it's more of a curiosity that gives the Enterprise a surprising historical footnote in the ""Star Trek"" universe.",8
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Assignment: Earth (TV Episode 1968)",The Mission of Gary Seven and Ms.Lincoln,"An anomaly among the episodes of the original series, this finale to the 2nd season functions both as a sequel to ""Tomorrow is Yesterday"" and as a pilot for a new series which never came to be. Rather casually stated by Kirk's voice-over in the beginning, the Enterprise crew has purposely traveled back to 1960's Earth, following up on their accidental visitation in the previous episode from the 1st season. I wonder what Federation bigwig(s) greenlit this mission - everyone's always concerned about the Prime Directive but they think nothing of possibly altering Earth's history and wiping away the past couple of centuries of progress - I guess 'Murphy's Law' no longer applies in the 23rd century. Sure enough, the ship intercepts someone beaming to Earth from over 1000 light years away - so much for non-interference. The episode is at its best in these early scenes, when we meet the mysterious Gary-7, who, tho apparently human, can resist Spock's Vulcan nerve pinch and has knowledge of the future. Kirk, the one who is in the wrong time, still behaves like it's his job to police the spaceways above Earth and treats Gary-7 as guilty until proved innocent. The shots of '60s New York City now appear as strangely primitive, just as Gary-7 describes them; it's a weird play on perspective since the viewer is in 'futuristic mode' when watching this show.The episode has some slow spots, especially with all the stuff about the rocket waiting to be launched, but it makes up for a lot of this with the intriguing Gary-7 character, played by actor Lansing with gravitas, an aura of solemn heroism and possible menace (note: Lansing's credit appears in the beginning of the episode rather than the end, also anomalous). The interesting backstory for such special agents as Gary-7 was created, of course, with the intent of an on-going series on present day Earth, probably as a combo superspy/alien visitors storyline, complete with futuristic gadgets and self-aware computers. There was a whole new modern mythology waiting to be launched with the premise presented here and I still sometimes visualize an alternate universe where we were treated to a season or two worth of adventures concerning agent Gary-7 and his daffy secretary, Ms. Lincoln. Oh, yes, Ms. Lincoln - this was an early role for the unusual actress Teri Garr, who brings her now well-known pert spunk to the part - she was deliriously eccentric and quite beguiling right from the start. I really would have liked to have seen the further interaction between her and the black cat, as well as Gary-7, a possibly odd menage-a-trois, to say the least. By the way, check out Kirk's swift beam out of the two cops from the Enterprise; seems he did learn one thing from his misadventures in ""Tomorrow is Yesterday"" - beam 'em out pronto!",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Assignment: Earth (TV Episode 1968)",Robert Lansing's credit,"I noticed a few comments regarding Robert Lansing not being in the acting credits for the Assignment: Earth episode. Lansing was actually listed in the show's opening credits, along with the episode title. I believe he's the only Star Trek guest star to be introduced in such fashion, perhaps giving an early clue that the episode was indeed intended as a pilot for a new show. What's sad about Gary Seven (Lansing's character) not receiving his own show is that we missed out on a chance to watch Terri Garr develop her role as unwitting secretary Roberta Lincoln. Garr has since gone on to establish herself as a fine actress, both in comedy and drama. And she came back to science fiction with her role as Richard Dreyfuss' wife in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Among the best shots from the Assignment: Earth episode is the NASA footage of a rocket's stage separation high above the Earth. And who could forget the (all too) brief shot of Victoria Vetri as Gary Seven's mysterious cat in humanoid form? That appearance of Playboy's 1968 Playmate of the Year (as Angela Dorian) was just another in a long line of guest appearances of sexy '60s sirens on Star Trek.",
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Assignment: Earth (TV Episode 1968)",Why Did They Make This Episode The Season 2 Finale?,"This is a decent episode and yes, I'm sorry we didn't get to see Gary Seven do more in 1968/9's earth. Would have been a cool show for sure, but since this is a Star Trek episode and came from my favorite season, season two, I question why they made this the season and possibly show's finale. From Trek stuff I've watched, this show was practically canceled after season two and only a letter writing campaign saved it. Had it not been saved for season three, Trek was said to have died a death not being shown in reruns because it wouldn't have had enough episodes to sustain it. So with all of that in mind, was this the way we wanted to remember Trek? Granted Turnabout Intruder is several notches below in my opinion from Assignment Earth, so I guess that point is mute. I just hate the way TV producers played with us and didn't give us finality with the shows we are so attached to to just give us a another average episode when it could be the shows last, a freaking spin off even! OK why it doesn't rank all that high to me. First off, (than the geeky stuff), since this is a spin off pilot attempt, character banter between Kirk, Spock and McCoy are at a minimum, McCoy is hardly seen! Thats why Trek was great and this episode puts them in the background, thanks TV Executives! OK now Geeky stuff, this episode shatters the premise that time travel is a unique occurrence, they casually say they did it for research purposes. HUH, whats up with that? The ramifications of time travel on demand totally change this shows universe, this is lame writing! If they wanted to do this they should have done another angle, my suggestion is a higher evolutionary being transports them (Kirk and a few others or the whole ship, it doesn't matter) to this time saying that another entity is messing with your continuity. That still leaves the time travel option a special case. OK other things I picked up, Scottie using a weather satellite to view the earth close up, OK I'll buy into that, EXCEPT when the camera angles are from the ground up! How about when Kirk and Spock get beamed over to Sevens place at the end, I didn't see them grab the phasers and extra communicator; oh brother another ""Piece of the Action"" deal! OK getting really geeky here and this isn't specific to this episode, but why cant they do the transporter control thing from the bridge? I mean they would still beam into the transporter room but can't they have extra controls on the bridge to do that? Scottie is doing a whole lot from the transporter room with communications using that weather satellite so he didn't have to go to the bridge, so I wonder why the same concept was never applied with the transporter? Anyway, I'm ranting a little, decent but not not great episode; yes I wish a series was made as a spin off, but this one kind of cheapens Trek TOS in my opinion.",7
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Assignment: Earth (TV Episode 1968)",This could have been have been a great series.,"This could have been have been a great series. Very good episode. Why was Robert Lansin as Gary Seven uncredited? He was wonderful. Teri Garr was also very good. Together they brought a higher level of acting to the show. This ""Star Trek"" episode is one of the best. The ""Assignment: Earth"" pilot could have gone on to push the space adventure line into a stronger direction. It was ahead of its time. It would take a decade before TV realized just how powerful and deserving this genre is. NBC, blew it again. They dropped ""Star Trek"" after 3 years. They had it all right there for a franchise that would last decades and this episode could have been the foundation for an entirely new direction and yet another franchise. Sad it never worked out. Someone should give it another try as a movie!",10
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Assignment: Earth (TV Episode 1968)",Terri Garr speaks for a generation,"The thing about this episode that stands out for me is my reaction to it when I saw it premier in early 1968, when I was 14. Terri Garr's character, far from playing as a ditzy blonde, instead read to all of us as a member of the baby boomer generation saddled with the hypocritical bs of those over 30, who we were learning to Not Trust. Thus her character suspiciously blowing the whistle on one and all, ultimately leading to her fine peroration toward the end where she expresses the hopes and fears of a generation. We all marveled at this episode in school during the course of the following week, and all boomer trekies have a soft spot in their hearts for Terri Garr on the strength of this performance. I'd also add that you have to remember we were all too close in memory to the Cuban Missile crisis of Oct 1962 for comfort. The notion of a nuclear war was physically felt back in those days in a way that it hasn't been since, well, 1962.",8
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Assignment: Earth (TV Episode 1968)",An interesting example of what could have been,"This was a pilot episode of a new series produced by Gene Roddenberry about a time traveler named 'Gary Seven'. And the idea was introduced by having the stars of this potential series appear on a Star Trek episode. Robert Lansing appears uncredited as this main character (why he wasn't listed in the credits is odd considering he was obviously the star). I liked Lansing's cold and somewhat rigid style--I really thought it worked for his character, but I also realize this might have also left some feeling rather cold about him. He wasn't exactly 'Mr. Personality' in the episode. Instead, the major emoting was done by his ditsy assistant played by Teri Garr. It seems the spin off series was to have been about a man who traveled from a far more advanced world to secretly help mankind.However, when Mr. Seven accidentally lands on the Enterprise, they are shocked to see him and think he's up to no good. You see, the Enterprise actually meant to go back to the 20th century to do some unobserved data collection for historical reasons and there is no conceivable reason why they should intercept a space traveler all the way back then. How all this is resolved is something you'll have to see for yourself.As for the strengths of the show, the acting was very good and humor was infused now and again to make the show seem not so heavy-handed--which I appreciated. Unfortunately, the pilot was never picked up--and Roddenberry had a lousy track record in trying to bring other sci-fi shows to television (such as his two attempts with the character Dylan Hunt). And considering that it was pretty entertaining and a very interesting concept, I always feel a bit wistful when I see this episode.",8
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Assignment: Earth (TV Episode 1968)",Who were the Policemen?,"An enjoyable episode but I've decided to focus on a few perhaps lesser known points.The Policeman who says 'Charlie' to his colleague (when beamed aboard the Enterprise) is the actor Ted Gehring who had a long career appearing in many well known series (Bonanza - The Virginian - The Fugative) to name but a few. He also met Mr Shatner again in TJ Hooker.Meanwhile his sidekick was none other than Bruce Mars who played Finnegan in Shore Leave. He played that role very well but I cannot find a reason why his career ended in 1969.Footnote Bruce is now known as Brother Paramananda, he is a senior monk in the Self-Realization Fellowship.One other point which I do not understand is why - after the CGI enhancements - they left the rather obvious 'still' photographs of the rocket in the episode.",8
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Assignment: Earth (TV Episode 1968)","Not one of my favorites, but worth watching just for seeing Teri Garr","This isn't one of the better Trek episodes, but Teri Garr brings the zaniness to Roberta Lincoln that she would bring to many other roles in her career. There are an awful lot of deux ex machinas in the plot--particularly Scotty's ability to use a single weather satellite to view seemingly anywhere in the United States, from any angle--and one serious hole.When Kirk and Spock arrive at Gary Seven's offices, Roberta calls the police, then tries to stop them. Spock holds her, and, when the police arrive, holds her until Kirk gains access to the inner offices, then runs after Kirk, leaving her free to let the police in--in other words, he passes up a zillion opportunities to put her to sleep with the Vulcan Nerve Pinch.Pour quoi, M. Spock?",5
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Assignment: Earth (TV Episode 1968)",Star Trek's third 'pilot?',"The final episode of the second season was unusual as it was also the pilot for a proposed new series, 'Assignment: Earth,' which also serves as the name of the episode. Robert Lansing and a very young Teri Garr were to star in the new show, which was never picked up by the network. Gary Seven (Lansing) is a time-traveling human from the future, sent to 20th-century Earth to help mankind through various difficulties, and Roberta Lincoln (Garr) is his somewhat ditsy secretary. Gary Seven is ultra-cool, ultra-strong, and ultra-smart, sort of an intergalactic James Bond. His first assignment is to destroy a nuclear warhead in orbit before it crashes back to Earth and starts World War III. The Enterprise gets involved because it has traveled back in time too, to do 'historical research.' It is the only time that 'Star Trek' treats time travel as being so routine. In other episodes, it either occurs as an accident or through some alien force and is only attempted by the Enterprise as a last resort to set things right. Here, it is presented as standard procedure. At any rate, 'Assignment: Earth' is entertaining and one can see how it would work as a stand-alone series. No doubt there would have been a surfeit of dumb blonde humor provided by Ms. Garr, but even then the actress was so appealing, she transcended the stereotype. (Fast-forward to 'Tootsie' and consider her take on a similar character.) Kirk and Spock don't really do much but get in the way, which Kirk at the end says they were supposed to, according to the history books. ??? I never really understood that bit, but thanks, Captain.",7
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Assignment: Earth (TV Episode 1968)","Past, Present, and Future","One of the best Star Trek episodes was this one where the Enterprise has troubles reconciling past, present, and future when it interferes with a transporter beam that takes a man from the future on the ship and the whole ship and crew are beamed to 1968.The man from the future is Robert Lansing, code name Gary Seven and he's there to find what happened to a pair of agents from his time which is a thousand years ahead of the Enterprise future. He has a mission and he's on a deadline having to do with an orbiting satellite with an array of impressive nuclear weapons.The dilemma for William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy and for the whole Enterprise crew is what to do. They follow Lansing down, but of course aren't sure how their actions might change history. The not knowing makes this a most tense episode.Also Teri Garr gives a wonderful performance as a young woman who'd been hired by the two missing agents whom we learn were killed as a secretary. She's a bright but somewhat spacy girl who isn't quite sure what she's caught up in. Every scene she's in, Teri Garr steals.Another thought provoking episode from Star Trek prime.",8
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Assignment: Earth (TV Episode 1968)","1968, Aliens, Agents & A Black Cat","Season 2, episode 26. The Enterprise is ordered to travel back in time to 1968 Earth in order to monitor their communications and study how they survived desperate times. They have their deflector shields up so they will not be detected. The ship shakes violently and Mr. Spock calls to Kirk that something or someone is trying to beam aboard the ship which is seemly impossible because the technology was not developed in 20th century Earth. That transporter beam from where it originated is at least 1,000 light years away and as Scotty reminds Spock that is impossible, not even in their own century can a transporter beam reach that far - but it has happened. Kirk arrived to the transporter room only to find that Mr. Spock is correct - a man beams aboard holding a black cat named Isis, agent Gary Seven. Agent Seven tells them he is from 20th century Earth and was on another planet when they intercepted him, to step back and let him do what he must do in order to accomplish his mission or it will alter Earth's history and maybe even the lives The Enterprise - the future altered. Kirk is in a dilemma, what if all Gary Seven says is true? Bu what if he's lying and really an alien from the future trying to destroy Earth? Kirk must find out before he can let Seven go - that will require a medical examination, all the crew's help in analyzing how Seven got on the ship and for Kirk & Spock to beam down to 20th century, 1968 Earth.A most interesting episode captain. It deals with Earth's technology progressing faster than it's social and political maturity. Time travel, possible future aliens, secret agents, 1968 Earth, the prime directive, a black cat that Spock is strangely attract to and Kirk's suspicions over Gary Seven.9/10",9
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Assignment: Earth (TV Episode 1968)",When Kirk's lucky number was seven,"One of my favourite 'Star Trek' episodes.The U.S.S. Enterprise has hurtled back to 1968 A.D. on a mission of historical research. The world came perilously close to nuclear war and Kirk wishes to learn how it nearly happened. Intercepting a beam travelling through space, the crew are startled when a man ( Robert Lansing ) wearing a smart 20th century business suit and carrying a black cat materialises on board. He is just as surprised to see them as they are him. He gives him name as 'Gary Seven', a human being returning to Earth following time spent on an alien world. He is a fully trained 'Class One Supervisor', a sort of inter-galactic detective. The cat is called Isis and is unusually intelligent by feline standards. Contact has been lost with two other Supervisors. Kirk does not trust Seven and throws him in the brig, but he escapes and transports himself to Earth. Materialising in a plush New York office, he learns from his computer that his predecessors died in a car crash whilst trying to stop the arming of America's first orbiting space platform, countering a similar launch by other powers...'Assignment: Earth', the final episode of Season 2, was a back-door pilot for a series which never was. The late Robert Lansing was an actor of the Michael Rennie school; tall, handsome, authoritative. Fans of the '80's show 'The Equaliser' will remember him as Robert McCall's boss 'Control'. A series based around 'Seven' probably would have been fun, sort of like an American version of 'Dr.Who'. As his daffy secretary 'Roberta Lincoln', we have the lovely Teri Garr, a decade before becoming Richard Dreifuss' put-upon wife in 'Close Encounters Of The Third Kind'. At times this episode feels strangely like 'Mission: Impossible', the plot moves from New York to a rocket base and back again. The orbiting space platform idea had been done the year before in 'In Like Flint' starring James Coburn. Seven has some cool gadgetry at his disposal, including a pen that can kill/stun, a matter transporter concealed behind a vault door in his office, a talking computer ( how prophetic! ) and a typewriter that takes dictation all by its itself. What of Isis? She appears to be an alien woman masquerading as a cat.Kirk and Spock get to dress up in city clothes to try and find out what Seven is up to, leading to an amusing scene where Roberta accidentally knocks off Spock's hat, exposing his distinctive ears.By the end of the adventure, Kirk and Seven have become friends and Spock tells the Class One Supervisor that both he and Ms.Lincoln have some 'interesting experiences' ahead of them. What exactly these were fans never found out until the '90's, when Greg Cox featured the pair in his novels 'Assignment: Eternity' and 'The Eugenics Wars' parts 1 and 2.",10
14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Assignment: Earth (TV Episode 1968)",See Mr Spock pet a cat,"I am not a fan of this convoluted and contrived episode, that has long spells of several minutes where we see neither Kirk, Spock or McCoy. It was reportedly a pilot for another series, which flunked with good reason. Again we are back on 20th century earth, trying not to interfere with history. Thankfully this time, Jim's girlfriend doesn't have to die, but his attitude toward the time-traveling alien is somewhat strange. After spending the entire episode trying to thwart him, in the end, Kirk allows the alien to complete the mission, thus saving the day. Mr Spock also doesn't seem quite himself in this. Who knew he had such a proclivity for black felines? Who turns out to be a sexy calendar- girl type. Such a surprise. Currently in prison for attempting to muder her husband. I do love the street scenes of NY, where we see a large number of women parading around in apparently real fur coats on an average afternoon. A fur coat was the height of sophistication, class and luxury in that era. That is one of the things I love about Star Trek- it is a window into 1960's culture.Definitely not one of the best episodes. The writers are clearly running out of original ideas. A harbinger of what was to come in Season 3.",4
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Assignment: Earth (TV Episode 1968)",Borrowing From Another Series or Two,"Often, Star Trek like other series would borrow premises from other shows. In this case, the time traveling theme is borrowed from Irwin Allen and the Time Tunnel which was running during this period. This episode is definitely themed like Time Tunnel.Robert Lansing whose fame on TV came from 12 O'Clock High is borrowed here to be Seven, a man transporting into 1960's earth. Luckily this does not go too far and have anyone wind up in the Arizona Desert near the tunnel. The theme of changing history of this show is pretty well done regardless.Some say this was a pilot by Roddenberry for another series, but if that is the case, I wonder why he would borrow the premise from Irwin Allen? Everything here turns out like Time Tunnel as at the end of the show the Enterprise erases the history meddling in 1968 like that show did.",8
16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Assignment: Earth (TV Episode 1968)",The spin off that never was,"This episode sees the Enterprise return to 1968, the present day when this was made, to perform some historical research from orbit. The ship is shaken at the transporter activates and a man materialises; he has come from over a thousand light-years away but is dressed like a '60s businessman and carrying a black cat. He identifies himself as Gary Seven and claims that he is on a mission to prevent an event that could destroy the Earth. Kirk takes him into custody but is unsure what to do; if the man is telling the truth it is vital that he is released to finish his mission but if he is lying he could be plotting world destruction. Seven manages to escape from custody and beams down to Earth. He materialises in an office equipped with an advanced computer and sets about finding out what happened to the two agents who should be there. Soon a woman, Roberta Lincoln, arrives and he assumes she is the female agent; it turns out she is merely the secretary and she is more than a little surprised when she sees the futuristic technology he has. It turns out his mission is to cause a new US orbital nuclear defence platform to fail. Kirk and Spock beam down but they are still uncertain about his motivation; ultimately Kirk will have to decide whether to trust him or not.When I watched this episode I didn't realise it was intended to set things up for a new series; I wasn't surprised when I learnt it though as Gary Seven and Roberta are very much at the centre of the story with Kirk and Spock playing a significantly smaller role than usual. The story is interesting and right up until the end I was unsure whether Gary was a hero or a villain. Robert Lansing did a fine job in the role and Teri Garr was likable and cute as Roberta; the two of them developed a good chemistry over the course of the episode. As well as a good drama there are some nicely humorous moments such as when a couple of rather surprised policemen are beamed up to the Enterprise. Overall I found this to be a really enjoyable episode; it is just a pity that the series following the adventures of Mr Seven and Roberta didn't materialise; I have a feeling it might have been good.",9

He is an undercover secret agent from an unknown planet sent on a peaceful mission to keep Earth ""on-track"" so it doesn't destroy itself before maturing into an advanced society centuries later. He crosses paths with The Enterprise, which is on a historical fact-finding mission to update and correct 20th century knowledge of Earth, circa 1968. Cleverly done using a lot of ""stock"" NASA footage, some of which matches well, and some that looks very generic and grainy. Gary Seven's assignment in this ""pilot"" episode is to cause the U.S. nuclear satellite to almost start WWIII, by malfunctioning with a live warhead. This will somehow prevent the actual war from ever happening. A fun episode. His cat, ""Isis"" transforms to human-like form, momentarily, at the very end. (She still purrs.) Of course, she is a ""knock-out""! A glimpse at a TV series that could have been a lot of fun but never happened. The last episode of the original series season two.

I just never got into this one. I'm frequently bored by a convoluted plot designed to join characters from one show with that of another. CSI has been doing this ad infinitum. Anyway, when time travel occurs (especially backwards) it never seems to work very well. We do have formidable adversary who isn't an adversary, really. Teri Garr who went on to be great in ""Young Frankenstein"" not too long after and the Enterprise people trying not to screw too many things up. Back and forth, to the ship, away from the ship. Police who come and go. For me it is so jerky and unfulfilling that I am always disappointed when this episode shows up. Apparently, they didn't worry about narrative hooks in this day. Personally, if I were a new viewer of Star Trek, I probably wouldn't have looked forward to the next season if this was an example to go on.",6
19,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Assignment: Earth (TV Episode 1968)",Good acting distracts you from all the plot holes,"This episode is riddled with plot holes, implausible events, and annoying political commentary, but the acting of Gary Seven and Ms. Lincoln is good enough to overshadow all of this. Points to consider:1. The Enterprise obeys a strict non-interference dictum, yet they are willing to endanger the entire future of the earth by traveling back in time, just to do historical research.2. The Enterprise decides it must travel back in time to figure out how the earth survived the 1960's, and yet all they could ever want to know about the 1960's is available in their ship's computer archives of 1960's newspapers, magazines, TV news reports, and declassified military reports. It's not like the 60's were literally prehistoric.3. Kirk stumbles upon Gary Seven and for no good reason decides Gary must be a bad guy. He decides to hunt down Gary and stop him even though he has no idea who he is or what he he is doing, despite all the risk in altering the future.4. The lack of millions of time traveling tourists bumbling all over 1960's New York means that time travel is very hard or is in most cases forbidden by time cops. Yet, the Enterprise crew treat time travel like it's a walk in the park.5. A single weather satellite cannot give you different-angled views of an object on earth's surface, no matter how powerful it's zoom lenses.6. Using teleportation, Kirk and Spock could beam right to where Gary Seven is and stop him. The argument that they don't know where Gary is and therefore don't know where to beam is invalidated at the beginning when Scottie verbally leads Kirk and Spock to Gary. Scottie could simply beam them to Gary instead of telling them directions.7. This episode makes political commentary with the subtlety of a sledge hammer: ""Nukes are bad!"" Political commentary in fiction can be thought provoking, but when the audience is bashed over the head with a political viewpoint, it becomes annoying propaganda. Besides the lack of subtlety, this viewpoint is also naive. Nuclear armaments prevented World War III (""peace through strength"").8. If a foreigner sabotages a powerful U.S. military asset, it is considered treason - a serious crime specifically mentioned in the constitution and often worthy of the death penalty. And, yet we are supposed to be cheering for Gary Seven as he sabotages a missile. Why? Apparently, being trained by advanced aliens gives you license to play God and subvert the will of the people, because they don't know what's best for themselves.9. There's no better way to take the Star Trek shine off of Kirk and Spock than to put them in normal clothes, wandering around regular New York, accomplishing nothing, and having no comedic run-ins or witty exchanges. I see this every day (it's called ""commuting""), and it's not terribly interesting.",6
20,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Assignment: Earth (TV Episode 1968)","Failure, both as a Star Trek episode, and as a Pilot for a new series. Probably the worst Trek episode.","Let me count the ways.Failure as Star Trek:
1, Enterprise is back in 1968 for historical research. That is the reason given in the opening. Nonsense. As other more intelligent critics than I have pointed out, they make it seem casual for time travel to take place.2, Prime Directive, non-interference, especially of the timeline - out the window. The way 007, I mean Secret Agent Gary Seven transports to the Enterprise - nonsense. Leading to Kirk's dilemma if he should trust 007. More nonsense.3, Not much for Kirk and company to do. Their reason for being there #1, Bogus. Kirk's trust of 007 #2, Bogus. Kirk running around with Spock in business suites - BogusFailure as Pilot for new show:
1, 007's back story is lacking and confusing. He was raised on another planet, a descendant of abducted humans from 6000 years ago, for the purpose of helping the aliens help earth overt destruction from mankind's technological achievements outpacing their love of peace, or some such nonsense. Sounds like a bunch of convoluted contrived nonsense. To give the producer/writers credit, there are some decent ideas here, however, they are half baked, non-ready for consumption. 2, The characters are boring. We have 007, he's all business, not fun. This is our lead? Then the cat. The best part of this character was when the cat turned into a hot chick on the couch for two short shots. The cat did nothing. Terri Garr is dumb and her character is dumb. This is the cast of the new show. A boring spy/dude, a ditzy secretary, and a cat/chick that does nothing. And what are they going to do? Save mankind from itself?So, watching it as Star Trek, it's probably one of the worst. We don't get to see Kirk and company enough. Not great acting. The story has too many holes. The ""guest"" stars are boring and their story is boring. The chemistry from these actors sucked as well. I mean they spent a good deal of time trying to figure out how a typewriter types itself. I'm glad they didn't turn this into a series. And it's an insult to Star Trek and all the actors and everyone involved that they were forced to participate in the garbage.",1

As is, this episode remains a curio of what might have been. Lansing is Gary Seven, a human from the 20th century who comes from a hidden planet containing a race that cares also about Earth's survival. The Enterprise time travels back to 1968 to research Earth's history, considering all that was happening at the period. They intersect a transporter beam that shakes the ship, introducing them to Seven. Garr is a secretary who has no idea Lansing is this interstellar agent working to maintain Earth's stability amidst such a hotbed of developing global turmoil. A rocket launch containing a warhead must be diffused and Kirk is unsure Seven is looking to prevent potential WWIII or encourage it...Spock admits to Kirk that his decision on trusting / distrusting Seven has no facts to depend on, just his human intuition. I enjoy these time travel episodes a lot, and although this focuses on a rocket blasting from Cape Canaveral as the big event needing assistance from Seven, instead of preventing an assassination or government initiative, seeing Kirk and Spock in 1968 New York and held by security while NASA conducts their launch is neat. Lansing, all business, and Garr her bubbly, flighty secretary astonished by all his gadgets and alien technology, make for a fun team, while the cat, Isis, always by her man's side, becomes herself an amusing supporting character. Spock, holding and petting Isis, finds himself ""strangely drawn"" to her! With Scotty standing by the transporter so he can get Kirk and Spock where they are needed, and humans from 1968 finding themselves inadvertently involved (two police are accidentally beamed aboard the Enterprise while a security guard at the Cape gets the ""funnies"" from Lansing's servo and the Vulcan neck punch from Spock!). Isis briefly seen as a sexpot by Garr while no one else notices, adds new dimension to her close contact while in feline form with those petting her! Lansing not succumbing to the Vulcan neck pinch, easily escaping the brig, and wrestling multiple officers in the transporter room before Kirk got him with a phaser stun sure establishes him as a formidable opponent.

You can't get the really close up side views of the man in the gantry from way up in an orbit.I am surprised that they didn't get into one of the classic time travel conumdrums - while trying to see why man survived the nuclear crisis, it may be that THEY (the Enterprise crew) were partly responsible, thus setting up a kind of loop in time.",

0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cage (TV Episode 1966)",history in the making,"Just think...if Jeffrey Hunter had wound up playing the Captain in Star Trek, he might be alive today. Hunter died in 1969 from a subarachnoid hemorrhage, probably caused by an explosion that imploded instead during a film he was working on in Europe. Interesting thought.The Cage was the most expensive pilot in NBC history to that point. Though the Star Trek idea had its supporters, the network couldn't see past its nose to pick up the series. They did, however, agree to a second pilot with some changed elements - like a woman who was second in command. The reasons why Hunter did not do the next pilot have been debated. A friend of Hunter's stated that Hunter's wife, Dusty, thought science fiction was low class and didn't want him involved in the show. And, according to Shatner's book, she also made unreasonable demands of the producers.It's worth remembering that back in the '60s, science fiction, space movies, etc., did not have the ""A"" status that they do today. B movies only became A movies after Star Wars.The Cage is a not only very good but touching, and of course, it's fascinating to see ""Star Trek"" before it became a cult classic. The story concerns a planet that exists basically on Mind Control, and the inhabitants in charge capture Pike in the hope that he can help replenish their race with an earth woman who is there as a result of a ship crashing. Susan Oliver is the woman.During the run of the series, in order to recoup some of the costs of this fabulously expensive pilot, it was incorporated into a two-part episode, with another actor playing the now near-vegetative Captain Pike.I love seeing films such as this that were done before all the special effect technology became available, because they were done in such innovative and imaginative ways. The Cage is worth a look to see the genesis of a show that became part of our culture.",7
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cage (TV Episode 1966)",Nice look into what Star Trek might have been...,"This is one of my very favorite episodes, and I've always wondered what a Star Trek with Captain Pike would have been like. It has excitement, suspense, and even a thinking plot. It definitely works much better as a stand-alone episode than it does as a backdrop for ""The Menagerie"". In that capacity, it is used as a flashback to propel a very odd story where Spock commandeers the Enterprise to deliver a badly injured Pike to what appears to be a morally bankrupt race so he can live out an illusion of a normal life. Very un-Spock like IMHO.That said, it seems apparent to me that Gene Roddenberry lifted some very obvious plot ideas for this pilot from the Twilight Zone episode ""People Are Alike All Over"". He even borrowed actress Susan Oliver who appeared in that episode in a similar role and a with a similar name (""Teenya"" vs ""Vina"").",8
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cage (TV Episode 1966)","Trek with Capt. Pike, paving the way for Kirk and co.","Before Scotty and Sulu; before Dr.McCoy; before even Capt. Kirk, Spock (Nimoy) was under command of Capt. Pike (Hunter) in the familiar Enterprise (tho with a crew of only 203, as mentioned). The genesis of this original version of a proto-Federation from Roddenberry can be traced back to the spectacular sf film of about 8 years earlier, ""Forbidden Planet."" As in that film, it was established that some kind of space fleet exists in mankind's future, on patrol or a Star Trek or just exploring (mostly exploring in Roddenberry's vision). There was a commander Adams in the earlier film; Roddenberry first scripted a Capt. April; when the pilot for a new TV show was finally filmed in late '64, he settled on a Capt. Pike, here a more morose and disenchanted version of Capt. Kirk, tired of the heavy responsibilities associated with such a ship's captaincy. This pilot episode, filmed close to the standards of a feature film, takes on unexpected connotations from the perspective of current times. Since it was later established that this episode took place about 13 years prior to the events of the regular Trek series, one gets the impression of a long line of captains and ship's doctors, all debating, in succession, the values and principles of crew duties and regulations after particularly trying missions, as in an early scene here.In a clever scripting detail, we sort of come into the middle of a story as the episode begins: the crew just completed some mission or adventure on one of the Rigel planets; there were fatalities, everyone's tired. So the sense is that missions in space have been going on for quite some time. Now, the latest - a bogus distress call and pretty soon the captain is held captive by a race of big-headed aliens with extraordinary powers of illusion. It's amazing that the entire holodeck concept in the TNG series, over 20 years later, is given an early run-through here. As mentioned, the production values are close to those of a feature film - this is especially evident after the restored version of this pilot became available. Pike transits, thanks to such illusionary abilities, from one exotic locale to the next, never knowing what to expect. Jeff Hunter was pretty good as the captain, playing a bit closer to the vest than Shatner, some might say withdrawn, but with obvious leadership charisma. Nimoy, in this early version of Spock, lets loose a grin at least once, definitely a younger, less polished interpretation of his well-known character. I was a bit impressed by Barrett, who would've been 2nd-in-command had this show continued as is here. Back in the sixties, the powers-that-be could not accept a female of such high rank, but she pulled it off. They demoted her to lovestruck nurse by the time the regular show began. Hoyt seemed to exist merely as a 'bartender-as-doctor' personality, with none of the crackle Kelley brought to the role.The rest of the cast as the crew in this early version of Trek were quite bland, including an early role for Roarke, later a fixture in some biker films and ""Dirty Mary,Crazy Larry""(74). Guest star Oliver was more interesting as the fellow prisoner engaged in futuristic mating rituals with Pike - her Orion slave girl illusion was quite risqué for its time, but that was Roddenberry for you. The entire episode proved to be a highly cerebral, involved effort, too complex for the masses of that time in the view of decision-makers, and maybe even too serious in approach. Unexpectedly, a sequel to this pilot materialized during the course of the regular series, only a third of the way through the first season - ""The Menagerie"" parts 1 & 2 - where-in we learned the future fate of Pike, not a very pleasant prospect, as it turned out. After this pilot was rejected by the bosses, Roddenberry presented ""Where No Man Has Gone Before,"" starring Shatner as Kirk.",7
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cage (TV Episode 1966)",Cerebral Confusion At NBC and Everywhere Else,"I went to a Trekie revival in the late 1970's hosted by Gene Roddenberry, in person, the series creator. When I first saw this listed here, I was confused by the September, 1966 air date. This episode never aired on NBC or any network originally. If it has been shown intact, it has only happened in later years. At this revival, Gene showed only the black and white version of this as at that point, the color one had been lost and all he had was the black and white. It was shown on a large arena screen and was on film. He talked about the fact it had never aired and that NBC had decided against running this series based on The Cage.Gene used The Menagerie two parter as a way to air the pilot later. When the series began, it did not air first. He said that his purpose for the series went totally over the NBC execs heads. That is no surprise as NBC often was the second place network and sometimes fell to number three of three during the late 1960's. Gene Roddenberry originally pitched this series to NBC as Wagon Train to The Stars, based on his experience writing westerns like Have Gun, Will Travel.Often success would come to NBC by accident. The accident here is that they gave Roddenberry a second chance to start this show.That is what happened with Star Trek. Star Trek established the teenage generation following for NBC at the perfect time here as NBC would accidentally follow it up with other series this demographic liked. In no small part Rowan & Martins Laugh-In, an experiment in modern comedy-variety series succeeded because frustrated Trekies were looking for more network fare that was not conventional. Star Trek's fresh, bold, where no man has gone before theme became a credo at NBC as they went very far out later to keep this audience for many years. The Cage is the ultimate place for all this to begin.",8
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cage (TV Episode 1966)",A Great Start For The Series,"This show should not be compared to the later Star Trek series, except for the title.  This sci-fi ouclassed other shows of the time 2 to 1.  There had never been anything like this on television up to this point.Jeffery Hunter portrays a good starship captain.  The supporting cast do an admirable job, too.Sure, the effects look cheap, but, hey... this was a PILOT for the series. This story was good enough to be decked out into a 2-parter episode in the Star Trek series that began the next year in 1966.I am glad that Paramount released this show to the home market.  It stands alone in its simple story of space travel.  And it works!",
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cage (TV Episode 1966)",A groundbreaking sci-fi movie in its own right,"""The Cage"" might have ended up as a TV-movie had NBC decided not to try again with a 2nd pilot and then go to series.  If so, then ""The Cage"" would have been the best sci-fi movie since ""Forbidden Planet"" (to which it is clearly indebted)--all the more remarkable because it was made on a limited television budget and the poor facilities of Desilu Studios.Yet Roddenberry's vision yielded a story that overcame the plastic and wooden sets and the hastily put together special effects, to give us our first look into his ""Star Trek Universe""--a futuristic united Earth, which has finally been put right enabling mankind to set out for the stars.We're so accustomed to that ST Universe by now, that we may forget how truly visionary it was for 1965:  A giant warp-powered starship that looked truly futuristic and beautiful, not some cliche rocket shape.  The bridge, the very model of a well-designed command center, to be eclipsed only by the sets of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" three years later.  The transporter.  A female second-in-command and a mixed-gender crew.  And most important of all, believable, multi-dimensional characters who are supported by all that futuristic technology and special effects, rather than playing second fiddle to them.  Roddenberry's staunch insistence on believable characterization was what separated all the Star Trek series from any other sci-fi series--and is what has enabled the Star Trek franchise to last nearly 40 years.While the Captain Pike character didn't survive into the second pilot or the series, it also represented a fascinating departure from the TV heroes of most past TV series--something you might see in a big-budget first-run movie rather than a TV pilot film.  Pike is depressed and just plain burned out from the constant strain of command, and he is seriously contemplating resigning from Starfleet altogether because he just can't take it anymore. Like any harried, burned-out white-collar worker of today, he has unrealistic dreams of just going home at a young age to retire early, or maybe starting his own business, or anything to get him out of that captain's chair.  The adventure he has in ""The Cage"" acts as his redemption, giving him a live demonstration of Dr. Boyce's statement that no matter how tempted a man may be to pack it in and give up on life, he must find a way to meet life on its own terms, not run from it and hide in daydreams of a life that in the end isn't really for him.",
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cage (TV Episode 1966)",Pike's peak...,"Juxtaposing everything from FORBIDDEN PLANET to THE OUTER LIMITS, the first pilot for STAR TREK stands the test of Time (at least it does in my opinion). The retro look (which was actually retro even back then) bespeaks a simpler time (a time, unfortunately, when genuinely thoughtful science fiction was in very short supply on the big screen, and totally missing from network television). Prior to STAR TREK, there'd been THE TWILIGHT ZONE and THE OUTER LIMITS (whose episode THE SIXTH FINGER may have inspired the look of the Talosians in THE CAGE), but little else in the way of worthwhile fare. Nor would the promise of this particular vision of STAR TREK ever be realized. Narrow-mindedness consigned Pike's Enterprise to a footnote in the history of the STAR TREK franchise. But what might have been! Jeffrey Hunter as Pike comes across as an even more capable captain than Kirk. (Not that I'm knocking William Shatner; like Sean Connery as James Bond or Robert Conrad as Jim West, he's synonymous with the series- and rightly so: he was a charismatic performer, and shouldered the burden of leading man like a champ.) The less stoic Spock appears fascinated (to coin a phrase) by all things Alien encountered in the pilot. His attitude is almost childlike, and totally at odds with the Vulcan we eventually came to know and love, but Nimoy still manages to infuse the character with a scientific curiosity that's fun to watch. All things considered, THE CAGE is superior televised science fiction. As much as I loved the first season of the first series, I still pine for the series that might have been...",10
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cage (TV Episode 1966)",A brief glimpse of what might have been,"Captain Christopher Pike (Jeffrey Hunter) heads the U.S.S. Starship Enterprise in this pilot that the Powers that Be passed on, forcing Gene Rodenberry to make a second pilot with Wialliam Shatner as Kirk as well as making the new version more action oriented, less cerebral and ditching the idea of a woman as second in command. But that would all come later as this review is on the topic at hand. The unaired pilot deals with Pike being held captive in a glass cage by alien beings who possess the powers of mind illusions. It's in both black & white, as well as color (the parts that would be lated integrated into ""The Menagerie"" 2-part episode of Star Trek) It's more thought-provoking, less ""action-packed"" then the later series would end up being. And I throughly enjoyed it. This original version can be found as an extra on the Season 3 DVD set of Star Trak by the way.My Grade: B+",8
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cage (TV Episode 1966)",The First Trek And A Compelling One At That,"Watching Star Trek's first pilot episode The Cage is like watching a historical what if taking place. Famously deemed ""too cerebral"" at the time of its production The Cage is where one of the most popular television programs of all time got its beginning. While it might be the beginning that never went much further, forty-five years later it is still a compelling piece of entertainment.To begin with The Cage features some nice performances that make it a tragedy that never got to be developed past this one story. The best example of this is Jeffrey hunter as Enterprise captain Christopher Pike. Hunter's Pike comes across as being perhaps more sensitive then the later Captain Kirk yet just as tough. It's also interesting to note Leonard Nimoy as Spock and contrast his performance here with his later performances as the Spock of The Cage seems a bit less logical and a little more emotional. There's also a nice performance from Susan Oliver in the multiple guises of Vina which show off some considerable talent. Not to mention performances from Majel Barrett and John Hoyt amongst others.The Cage is also blessed with some nice production values. In particular in the make-up and costumes of the Tallosians which stand-up relatively well even forty-five years later. The sets and the vast majority of the other costumes, while definite sixties creations like many of those in Star Trek: The Original Series, are nice guesses all things considered. There's also an exciting and well staged fight sequence in the middle of the story. Last but not least there's the score by Alexander Courage which shows off not only the Star Trek theme but Courage's skills as a composer. Together they show an inkling of what might have been if this version of Star Trek had not been aborted.That said everything isn't perfect. If anything can be said to be a major drawback to The Cage it is the special effects. While most of them are passable and still work, some don't. This is especially true of the shots of the Enterprise itself which are far from convincing most of the time. There's also the matter of the warp sequence which looks to be incredibly cheaply done. That said there's also some fine effects like the sequence with Vina at the episodes end. The effects might be questionable but they serve the story well for the most part.If any single element of The Cage stands out today it is the Gene Roddenberry script. Once you get passed some of the clunky techobabel and some of the dated dialog (like Pike's ""women on the bridge"" line early on in the episode) there is an intriguing and compelling tale. Beneath the surface it is a tale of a society so lost obsessed with illusion it has lost its other knowledge and its morality (an unintended metaphor for fandom perhaps?). It is also the tale of a man (Pike) who seeks to escape his responsibility and rebels when given the chance. It also contains a Nice little romance in the midst of a nicely constructed story that is far from intrusive and rather compliments the story by giving it an emotional anchor. It's no mistake that The Cage in a later form (the Original Series two-part story The Menagerie) won the Hugo Award which convinces me that, given some editing, The Cage would be just as compelling and watchable today.The Cage stands as an interesting piece of television history. With nice performances, good production values and a script as impressive now as it was then The Cage represents the beginning of one of television's most popular series. It also stands out as a fascinating what if of how Star Trek might have been.",8
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cage (TV Episode 1966)",A Star is Born!,"Before Star Trek was a fully fledged religion, a multimedia behemoth spanning 5 show, 12 films (and counting), books, video games and the like, it was an unproven, vulnerable and daring concept. Few audiences ever get a chance to appreciate their favorite shows' test runs, and Star Trek again goes the distance by not just unearthing its long lost pilot, but even giving it the extra polish it deserves.The Cage was rejected as a pilot for being too cerebral and low on action, so while many of its traits came to define the series - transporter beams, phasers, pastel-costumed aliens, class M planets (strangely abundant it seems) - others did not. Captain Christopher Pike (Jeffrey Hunter), less likable but more interesting than Kirk, jumped ship, and the crew was reshuffled. The sometimes quaint technology was also given a small update, so exit 23rd century fax machines.What is striking, though, is how firmly it sets its tone and grasps its limitations, using exploration and adventure as subtext to its central dual of wits. There's a mean edge to the plot and some of the characters that would come to define what Star Trek can be at its very best, while making us marvel at how out of our depth we might be in the vastness of the universe.Nearly 50 years on, this stand-alone episode could well be one of the finest science fiction films ever made, never mind the glorious retro-kitsch masterpiece it equally qualifies as. Even despite the limited means, one can feel the creators' total commitment to the universe they are just beginning to explore before our very eyes, and the huge sense of possibility.Whatever your feelings are about Star Trek, if you have any interest in science fiction, you owe it to yourself to see this. What we have here isn't just some dated television milestone, but a hugely rewarding piece of entertainment in its own right.",10
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cage (TV Episode 1966)",the road not taken,"This is a fascinating look at the ""Star Trek"" that never was. Jeffrey Hunter made what was undoubtedly the worse career move in show biz history by deciding not to continue with ""Star Trek."" This is a shame; I actually prefer Captain Pike over both Captains Kirk and Picard. He was more reflective, less pompous or self-righteous. John Hoyt gave an interesting interpretation of the ship's doctor. On the other hand, the cast is a little too white bread. Unless one counts Mister Spock, there were no ethnic minorities in the crew of this Enterprise. One of the great strengths of the original series was its ethnically diverse crew, especially Nichelle Nichol's Uhura, who provided inspiration for generations of young African-American women. That aside, ""The Cage"" is an absorbing sci-fi thriller in the best tradition of Asimov and Heinlein, and the big-brained Thalosians have set a standard for TV and movie portrayal of space aliens that has lasted forty years.",10
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cage (TV Episode 1966)","""There's a way out of any cage and I'll find it"".","The quote above is from Captain Chrostopher Pike (Jeffrey Hunter) stranded on the planet Talos IV, but it could just as well have been Gene Roddenberry considering how he might bring his visionary space-Western to the small screen back in the Sixties. With hindsight, one wonders how the execs at NBC didn't see the potential for a cerebral sci-fi show back then, but then again, cerebral execs are putting things like 'Jersey Shore' on TV today, so what do I know.The story line for 'The Cage' should be familiar to anyone who's seen both parts of 'The Menagerie' which debuted in Star Trek's first season. Roddenberry used most of the footage to explain the eventual fate of Captain Pike in what many consider one of the best stories of the entire series. Watching it in both it's original and restored versions is an interesting exercise, as we get a unique glimpse into what Roddenberry might have been originally thinking about. Majel Barrett for example could have been destined to be second officer in command one day. Introduced as Number One on the bridge of The Enterprise, Barrett's role was downgraded to Doctor McCoy's assistant once the series got underway, and as a blonde to boot.Though it's not as apparent in 'The Menagerie', Spock is presented here as a bit too strident considering his character's development over time; one might say he was almost emotional. Other than Pike, Spock and Number One, the rest of the crew seemed rather bland, with John Hoyt's portrayal of Dr. Boyce as the only other character of significance. It might be his age worked against his making the final cut. Sure it's discrimination, but can you see him arguing with Spock each week the same as McCoy after having that bartender/doctor talk with Pike?A couple things I got a kick out of - did you catch the old style 1960's TV set in the Captain's quarters with the wood cabinet? That's as stylish as it got back in the day. Also, I don't recall another episode of Trek in which the crew, when not on duty, would walk around in casual clothes on board the Enterprise. In fact I don't recall anyone ever being out of uniform unless it was on shore leave or in costume as part of a story line.Fortunately for us fans, 'The Cage' is readily available for viewing today, released almost two decades after the original series run, in 1986. Though the special effects and cinematography aren't anywhere near what you'd expect to see in films made today, for it's time the show was breaking new ground and would have an impact on both TV and movies in the future. It's probably a cliché to say that the series went where none had gone before, but still, it all had to start someplace, and this was as good a place as any.",8
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cage (TV Episode 1966)",Feature Film Quality that was denied to the series,"When I say ""Feature Film"" I refer to the look, feel, and the Feature Film Actors used in this very 1950's style Pilot that was rejected by NBC.The first time I had seen the full cut of this was when it was released by Gene Roddenberry as an ""Extended Version"" back in 1989, it was released during the first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation.It was great, but several key scenes had only existed in Black and White Prints at the time, the full Colourised version had been lost, so that version, the best that could be released at the time, was all there was available.It is only recently with the ""Remastered"" version of TOS which includes the ""Enhanced Content"", that the full version of this in full colour has been made available - And so we, the original Fans of Trek, get to see, finally the Original First Pilot AS INTENDED - The way it was shown to NBC Executives way back in 1965 or so.The Enhanced version I am referring to, was left pretty much the way it originally looked. One of the things that was amazing about this Pilot was the COLOUR, very rich. It brings to mind such 1950's sci-fi classics as ""Forbidden Planet"".The final thing I realised, just recently, was this Pilot used Feature Film actors: Jeffery Hunter as Captain Pike, John Hoyt - Himself veteran of ""When Worlds Collide"" - As Dr Boyce - Peter Duryea, son of Dan, as Lt. Tyler, and Laurel Goodwin, from Elvis Presley's Misnamed ""Girls Girls Girls"" as the red-haired and flaming Yeoman Colt. Even Majel Lee Hudec, as Majel Barrett/Roddenberry was named back then was originally a feature film ""Black Widow"" on several 50's Noir films.If this were just another 40 minutes longer, it could have been released as a major Motion Picture and made some money back for Desilu. Too bad nobody ever thought of this back then. Fortunately, this mini-feature film became the backbone for one of the best Original Series and only double-episode, ""The Menagerie"" - Hugo Award winning material. So this Pilot did not have to sit on a shelf for 25 years before we were able to see at least parts of it.But during the 25th anniversary of Trek, it was finally released by Gene, and practically another 25 after that, it was remastered, re coloured, and given to us so watch in the best way possible, in the enhanced edition Blu Ray release.Watching this brings me back to the first Movies I ever saw as a Kid, the books I read by Heinlein, the short stories of Poul Anderson and Harlan Ellison.",10

Although for anyone who has seen this episode/movie it is obvious that it would not take a genius to see the potential of Star Trek from ""The Cage"".  (Dont confuse this with the ""Menagerie"", although it is easy to do so).This episode is some of the best TV or movie writing ever.  It starts out with our Captain (Pike) in crisis! (Almost unheard of for an authority figure at the time).  This self doubt, of course almost leads to his doom as he encounters a planet with aliens that can use a persons thoughts against him.  He is lured and then captured with the ""perfect illusion"", mostly in the form of a beautiful woman named ""Vina"".The story then proceeds to occur almost entirely in a Cage where he can be given any reality he wishes, as long as he cooperates.  When he does not cooperate, his negative thoughts are use against him as ""punishment"".Spock and the rest of the crew know they are being manipulated, but can not seem to do anything but follow the illusions.Captain Pike eventually believes he has learned to see through the illusions, only to find out that he was still being manipulated by his captures to do their bidding.  Only when his captors realize that humans are basically self destructive (in spite of a strong will to survive) do they let the Enterprise crew go on their way.  Vina's fantasy world turns out to be more pleasant than reality and she does not want to leave.Is this the story of the human race or what?  Especially now with modern ecological concerns do we realize how true this story will be for mankind.This story is pure genius from a true genius.",10

Instead, the smart folks at Paramount didn't want to let this first incarnation of the show stay on the shelf gathering dust, so they chopped it to pieces and made it the two parter, THE MENAGERIE. As a kid, I loved THE MENAGERIE for all of it's kitschy-ness. Seeing Jeffrey Hunter and the rest of the mostly unfamiliar crew (except for Spock with his larger than normal ears compared to later shows and Majel Barret in a role other than Nurse Chapel). However, even as a kid, despite liking THE MENAGERIE, the episode just didn't make much sense. BUT, in its pilot form, it was great--very entertaining and very original. I really liked Hunter and the rest of the gang and wish that perhaps they really had picked up the show as it was originally intended. The only serious negatives of the pilot was how Spock yelled all his lines (who told him to do this?) and how dull the uniforms looked without the red we have come to love and expect. Still, for Trekkers, Trekkies and the casual watcher, this is an exciting and almost movie-like pilot episode that is more exciting, in my opinion, than most later Star Trek shows.",9

16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cage (TV Episode 1966)",Ahead of its time,"The Cage was produced in 1962 and was in many ways ahead of its time. It is, essentially, a brave and progressive but not superbly well-polished story about aliens who once saved a human woman, and now want to find her a mate. They seek out the perfect specimen, Starfleet captain Christopher Pike, intending to keep him and the woman in a world of illusion, where their every wish is fulfilled, so that they will breed and eventually become an entire human community. However, in the end they realize that humans don't like to be kept imprisoned (well, duh!), and settle for letting the woman live alone (but with an unreal Capt. Pike) in the world of illusion to which she has become conditioned.It seems like this Star Trek pilot is trying to create a very serious story, and one can only commend it for its ambitious attempt to construct a story around what is basically a sexual theme (and remember, this was made in 1962). Unfortunately, on closer analysis, the story doesn't even begin to hold up. What was its message? How was the somewhat tragic resolution justified? Why did the aliens insist on having one human couple living in a world of illusion, and why didn't they just bring several more human beings into their plans? Ultimately, this story does not work, and this is a shame, because it proceeds with obvious serious intent, is more talkative and intellectual than the subsequent Original Series, and seems more willing to tackle controversial/sexual themes and relationships.I rate The Cage a 6 out of 10, and will even dare to call it some of the better Star Trek, despite its shortcomings.",8

The signature score by Alexander Courage, a previous version of the uniforms, the Enterprise starship, and the injected humor are all there. As well as a very human Mr. Spock (played by the great Leonard Nimoy, the only character to make it to the actual series that would ensue) - this will be the only time he actually grins! Also, look out for Majel Barrett as Number One (the first officer to Captain Pike) - although her character would be dropped, she would go on to play Nurse Chapel (as well as Lwaxana Troi in Star Trek: The Next Generation and the Enterprise computer in sequel Star Trek series).",7
18,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cage (TV Episode 1966)","Good fun, well acted space drama ... if you don't mind the wooden swords and air punches","Star Trek as it might have been. All the elements are there, except for Shatner. Jeffrey Hunter is clearly a capable actor, but in this 1964 pilot (which only saw light in 1986) he frequently looks like he's trying to remember his lines or pondering which facial expression to use while delivering them. It's so sad that he lost his life just a few years later, as I suspect he'd have been reworked into later episodes, series or even movies.Susan Oliver is stunning as 'the girl', and a little Googling showed that she was a remarkable individual in real life, overcoming a fear of flying to become a record-settling aviator, amongst other achievements.As for 'The Cage' as a something to watch, it's enjoyable if you're a Trekkie or sci-fi fan. Not full of the effects, explosions and mandatory action sequences of modern equivalents, but still a quality production - the fight scene is a little quirky, with obviously wooden swords and air punches, but this was a more innocent era when it was not felt necessary to imitate real violence in the way that it is now - the story mattered!Fun fact from studying IMDb data - Felix Silla (one of the aliens) is one of those actors who pops up, Forrest Gump like, in the background of various trend-setting movies or TV shows, Bonanza, The Addams Family (Cousin It), The Monkees, Battlestar Galactica, Star Wars (an Ewok), Spaceballs and Batman Returns amongst them.",9
19,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cage (TV Episode 1966)",It was groundbreaking!,"The Cage was genius. True fans know that even if NBC did not. It was well thought out, intelligent, and interesting. The cast was good with my particular favorite being Jeffrey Hunter as Pike. I will always believe that if Hunter had stayed on, it would have been an even better series that it already was. He was an incredible talent. There have been discussions on why he left. The reality is his wife was managing his career at that time. He was all for it, she hated it. She gave the producers a hard time and she gave her husband a hard time. Well he has to live with her, we didn't so he declined to continue. So I hold nothing against Jeff Hunter. His wife however...another story! And the reason for that is that Jeffrey Hunter died of a cerebral hemorrhage that was related to an accident on a movie set in 1969. A movie he never would have done had he taken on Star Trek. He might have lived a lot longer and for that reason alone I will never forgive his wife. But I still favor this episode as one of Star Trek's best!",9
20,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cage (TV Episode 1966)","Never Aired, Yet This Is My Favorite Episode","I did a marathon through the original series but I have found myself the most drawn to this unaired pilot. Captain Pike seems a bit more human and acted better than Kirk's character. Speaking of Kirk, neither him nor any of the main characters appear outside of Mr Spock. The cast this episode includes is extremely lacking in diversity but does feature a female officer something supposedly groundbreaking at the time. The story feels more complex than what the series turned out to be. The talosians are my favorite alien out of all Star Trek. They have a presence of power and intrigue from their mind control powers and appearance. The music that plays as the Enterprise is sailing through the stars is beautiful and really worked. A lot of my problems in these shows are the technobabble (not full fledged Trekkie) and this opener isn't too heavy to take outside it's complex story something I really would like to see more of. Don't get me wrong, the cast of Scotty, Uhura, and Dr McCoy are so much better than these all white American folk but most of the actual original series I enjoy in a so bad it's good way. I also feel like they didn't get all the potential the original series characters did until the movies came along. This pilot right here is leaps and bounds better than anything in season 3 I'll tell you that.",9
21,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cage (TV Episode 1966)",I Love Captain Pike!,"Captain Pike is the classic hero!  He is courageous, intelligent, a gentleman, and oh so good-looking too.  In my opinion, ""The Cage"" is the best Star Trek episode ever.  I am glad that Paramount released it to the public in 1985.  It is a pity that Jeffrey Hunter was unwilling to play Pike.  Although I love William Shatner with all my heart, and am a serious fan of the original series, I cannot help to wonder what Jeffrey Hunter would have done with the role of Captain of the Enterprise.  His Captain Pike is far more cerebral than Captain Kirk, and I think that makes him more interesting.For those of you who have not seen ""The Cage,"" I will not ruin the fun of finding out how Pike outsmarts his captors (it should not be a surprise to you that he does!).A minor comment: One thing struck me as strange about Gene Roddenberry's commentary about the original cast of Star Trek.  He said that he cast minorities in the original pilot against the wishes of the studio, but the original cast was almost all white (with the exception of one Asian actor). It was not until the second cast was put together that we see a starship crew that is composed not only of racial minorities, but people from different countries.",8
22,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cage (TV Episode 1966)",The Cage / Menagerie- Best Episode Of This Iconic Series,"I've always thought that the episode ""The Menagerie"", that made use of footage from ""The Cage"", is the most exotic (and romantic) and even melancholy, episode of Star Trek (or perhaps any TV show from the 1960's). This episode always stood miles apart from the other episodes in my opinion. It has a dream-like quality to it.",10
23,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Cage (TV Episode 1966)",What Never Was...,"Star Trek's original pilot is a thought-provoking hour. It doesn't have a lot of action as it focuses more on ethical and philosophical issues arriving with technology. As our tech gets better, should we use its power to create illusions for ourselves and our peers around us? Hiding physical appearances and environments in order to get an ideal outcome: Is this something we will see down the road? While this cast was discarded for the most part, Captain Pike & Co. would have been an interesting cast for this series if it chose to go in this direction.",9
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",Dr. McCoy's old Girlfriend is a Salt-Sucking Monster,"The very first episode of the original Trek series to air, though this was the 6th one filmed. The execs wanted to start things with a 'monster-of-the-week' mentality, but though the creature in this one is responsible for a number of crew deaths, it's more to be pitied than reviled by the end of the episode. It possesses startling chameleon powers, coupled with hypnotism & telepathic ability, enabling it to fool all the cast members during the story as it imitates several of them. Unfortunately, it craves salt, which it needs to survive, and human bodies fill the need very well. This is an example of sheer incompatibility between two races, which an angry Captain Kirk instinctively realizes in the 3rd act - he knows it's either his crew or the creature - there can be no half measures. We learn how intensely Kirk feels when he loses a crewman - check out the first killing here - and he has to go thru it a few more times in this episode.The Enterprise is on a routine check-up of 2 archaeologists on a planet with the ruins of an extinct civilization - but not all the inhabitants are extinct, as it turns out; there's one left. The storyline contains mystery and a chilling revelation. But, much of this episode emphasizes the routine: we never find out anything more about the dead civilization - it's probably one of many the Federation finds and explores; ship's and crew's routines are viewed during the creature's stalking, notably Yeoman Rand and Sulu; there's a casual banter between Kirk & McCoy which we all came to appreciate and look forward to in the next 3 years. Overall, this episode shows that future life, while with obvious differences in technology, will be largely the same for us humans. If there's a theme in this episode, it has to do with the inevitable extinction of a species, such as the American Buffalo, as if it's a rule of the universe. We can express sorrow for such a loss as part of the human equation, but, in the end, there's nothing we can do about it.However, the reason this episode probably gained some loyal followers of the Trek franchise right of the bat was probably not the monster. No, it must have been that easy interplay among the crew, especially the central trio - yes, including Spock, who right away starts insisting in this episode how he's immune to emotion but obviously enjoys a friendship with Kirk (Uhura even spells this out). And the human equation is delineated in McCoy's story in this one: he's reunited with his old girlfriend, so he's charmingly nervous as all hell, but in quick order, finds out she's been dead and her imitator must be killed, even though she's the last of her kind. Not only is this a personal tragedy for him, but he's also responsible for sealing the coffin on an entire species. The anguished look on his face towards the end is what makes this a memorable entry in the Trek mythos.",7
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",the dangers of a high-sodium diet,"The central idea of this story was anticipated by an episode in A E van Vogt's ""The Voyage of the Space Beagle"" (itself an anticipation of ""Star Trek""). A creature that resembles a mountain lion with tentacles sucks the ""id"" (potassium) from its victims' bodies. (There's no explanation of where other essential nutrients come from.)I understand why some fans don't much care for this episode. Though not intended as such, it resembles the ""monster of the week"" sort of story ABC insisted on for ""The Outer Limits"". As for the creature's failure to ask Kirk for a metric ton or two of salt -- Ryder urgently requested salt, but Kirk failed to provide it.I like it for a number of reasons, principally that it's cool and low-key (in contrast to the noisier theatrics of almost every episode that followed). The photography is grand, making effective use of pools of light against darker backgrounds. (This would soon disappear.) There's almost no music, with sound effects creating an eerie atmosphere. From a strictly ""aesthetic"" perspective, ""The Man Trap"" is arguably the best of all the Classic episodes.",8
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",Space: the final frontier...,"Predating the same mistake they made with Seinfeld's second season (specifically, the last four episodes) by 25 years, NBC aired the first episodes of Star Trek out of order (the approved pilot, Where No Man Has Gone Before, was broadcast as Episode 3). Not that it's a major problem: for one thing, the original Trek is famous for not having any significant narrative continuity between episodes (something that changed with the spin-offs); secondly, The Man Trap is just as good an example of what really makes Star Trek a riot to watch - the interaction between the characters.Starting, like any other episode, with the ""Captain's log, star date whatever"" narration by Captain James Kirk (William Shatner), The Man Trap takes place on a deserted planet where a scientist (Alfred Ryder) and his wife (Jeanne Bal) are studying the remains of an ancient society. The starship USS Enterprise is orbiting around the planet so that Kirk can give the two new food supplies and the ship's physician, Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy (DeForest Kelley), can check on their medical condition. This proves to be a bit awkward, since he and the woman were romantically involved once. Greater problems lie ahead, though, as Enterprise crew members are found dead. The cause is salt deprivation, and the strange marks on their necks suggest someone or something is doing this deliberately. Now it's up to Kirk, McCoy and Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy), the Enterprise's half-human, half-Vulcanian scientist, to find out what's going on and how to stop it.As is the case with most Star Trek episodes, the plot is quite simple: new planet, weird event, people in danger, Kirk and his pals saving the day. It's essentially the blueprint for the monster-of-the-week stories of The X-Files, not to mention the reason NBC agreed to give the show a chance (the original pilot, The Cage, was rejected because it was considered ""too cerebral""). The apparent simplicity is used as a tool to conceal deeper issues in later installments, but here it's exactly what it looks like: a very basic script that allows any viewer to access the classic Star Trek universe without worrying about any complicated, underlying ""mythology"" (an element that has been mandatory in successful genre shows made after 1990). In that sense, the first Trek series is the science-fiction equivalent of Seinfeld: watch a random episode, and you'll enjoy it just as much as if you were viewing them in the correct order (the feature films changed that a little, but it's another story).But if the stories are that simple, why bother? The answer is equally basic, but not less relevant for that: the leading trio of Kirk, Spock and McCoy (even though they weren't acknowledged in that way until the start of Season 2: up to that point, only Shatner and Nimoy are credited in the title sequence; everyone else is listed in the closing credits). The elementary combination of a curious, optimistic leader, a less cheerful doctor and a purely rational, (mostly) emotionless half-alien is the kind of narrative decision that, if played well, can make the fortune of any good story. Granted, this episode doesn't contain many of the typical elements (especially the more alien traits of Spock's personality), but the seeds of all the great things to come (the chess games, the arguments, the incessant exchanges of dry wit between Bones and Spock) are clearly visible here.In short, this may not be the proper first episode of the series, but given the standalone nature of the original Trek scripts, it works pretty well as an introduction to Gene Roddenberry's seminal TV universe, a place ""where no man had gone before"". It's the beginning of a small-screen legend, therefore a must-see.",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",Not your typical monster episode.,"On the surface of it this is a typical Vamp episode with a sci-fi twist. One might recall ""King Lear"" and the machinations of the King's daughters. That might partially explain the motivation of the antagonist, but there's more here. There's a basic functionality at work; predator and prey relationships, only this time they're encoded with a kind of intellectual gloss where the subject in question can camouflage themselves amongst the prey.And that's another theme that's explored here. A man denied of companionship, starved for it, whose occupation doesn't lend himself to mixing with throngs of female suitors, finds that his companion is a subject of interest. What will he do when presented its talents, even though there's a deadly price to be paid? How bendable is a man when it comes to his more basic yearnings.Another theme explores possible motivations of the creature, though even those are given a healthy amount of light, and we see the creature for all of its worth, when all is said and done. The distant world of M-113 has ruins of a civilization that once way, but is no more. Dr. Crater is essentially marooned for the sake of his work, and whether it's the heat, his work, or lack of a moral compass, we're given some insight to, but it does not explain the entirety of his decision, and Captain James T. Kirk exposes the truth.Do you destroy the living vestige of a lost empire? Do you kill off something that is an artifact of days long gone, but could destroy you? What would your decision be? Again, on the surface it is a silly superficial monster episode. But if you listen to the dialogue carefully, there are some ideas there that should give you pause to think.Enjoy.",
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",Memorable first episode has lots of surprises,"I hadn't seen this episode probably since it first aired, but picked it up recently, and was amazed by some of the bits of business going on with the crew of the Enterprise. A much calmer Sulu is tending to plants, crewmen are flirting with Uhuru, and Uhuru seems like she's more than a bit interested in Mr. Spock.Spock's nonplussed reaction to Uhuru's flirtatious banter is priceless. Spock was essentially a serious character, but there is an unmistakable undertone of comedy to the role. Spock in his first appearance here seems genuinely baffled by humans, and not as dry and sardonic as he became later.The monster becomes almost sympathetic when it speaks in disguise as Dr. McCoy. A really well written script makes this early episode hold up well.",6
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",One of the best episodes ever written,"I'm not a writer and probably wouldn't know the difference between a great or not-so-great story, but as one of the many baby boomers who has seen every episode of Star Trek - The Original Series, I feel ""The Man Trap"" is one of the best written. There were so many little sub- scenes that were out of character with most of the episodes that followed. For example, when Yeoman Rand brings lunch to Mr. Sulu, or when Capt. Kirk is eating a snack while on the bridge conducting a search, or when Uhuru is trying to make small-talk with Mr. Spock while he's at the helm. This was all great for character development, but I really missed this type of ""not part of the plot"" interplay in the episodes that followed. Also, the message of the right to survive vs. extinction was nicely done. I've made it a point to check-out some of George Clayton Johnson's other work . . . his Twilight Zone episodes in particular.",9
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)","""She looks exactly as I knew her twelve years ago"".","I would never have considered this to be the premiere episode of Star Trek, but now that I'm about to watch the entire series in order, I'll probably run into other surprises as well. Interestingly, Dr. McCoy is the central character here for the most part, except when he's being dressed down by Captain Kirk for dropping the ball a few times. It was also unusual to see Uhura attempting to flirt with Spock, and I was never that much of a fan back in the day to remember if that part of her personality carried forward into other episodes. Getting reacquainted with the characters and their idiosyncrasies should be a blast this time around.One of the cool things I like about Star Trek is the way the writers introduced concepts and names for things that made them seem like they were around forever. Like the Borgia plant in this story, it's name presumably derived from that of Lucrezia Borgia, the illegitimate daughter of a sixteenth century Pope. She was rumored to have used a hollow ring to dispense poison to claim her victims. Combined with the shape shifting ability displayed by Nancy Crater (Jeanne Bal), the series' first monster was suitably gruesome enough to entice future viewers to come back for more.One thing's true though, the early Star Treks took no prize for special effects when you get right down to it. The character metamorphosis was done as far back as Lon Chaney's Wolfman in 1941 and just as well. One thing I don't recall any movie or TV show coming to grips with is how the shape shifter also managed to change his clothes. I guess you're not supposed to think about that.So for a first effort (although I understand this story was actually the sixth one filmed), this was a reasonably good start to have the fans coming back for more. Back then there were no Trekkies yet, so I guess at least the germ of a good idea made it's way out of this premiere episode. Funny, but for some reason after watching this show, I had to go get a bowl of potato chips.",7
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",Quite a Salty Episode,"This is really quite good. The crew goes to a planet where Dr. Crater and his wife are due for a required checkup. They have been on the planet for five years. Mrs. Crater is a former love interest of Dr. McCoy and he looks forward with trepidation to seeing her. When the away team gets there each of them sees this woman in different. To McCoy, she appears to be as young as when they last met; Kirk sees her as one of an appropriate age; and the other crewman sees her as a woman from a pleasure colony. Now the bodies start to pile up. The men meet Dr. Crater who is uncooperative and unfriendly. A scream is heard outside and upon investigation, the body of the third crewman lies dead, circular burn-like marks on his skin. The central issue has something to do with salt. The body, when investigated, is lacking salt. Mrs. Crater is really worried that their salt supply is dissipated. Soon even more bodies are found. The thing is a shape-changer and it begins to find ways of attacking crew members to remove its salt.",8
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",Not the Trek philosophy,"I have a real problem with this episode. The Enterprise encounters an intelligent creature, the last of its race. Knowing this, they still blow it away. Maybe that's something the Terran Empire in the Mirror Universe would do, but this is not the Federation I know.Yes, the ""salt vampire"" was killing Kirk's crew. Nothing, but NOTHING gets him madder. But the Horta in ""Devil in the Dark"" was doing the same -- after killing several dozen miners -- yet Kirk ultimately protects and defends it. (Perhaps his actions with the Horta were the result of lingering guilt over his actions here? Who knows...)Of course, this creature must take much of the blame for its own demise. It was intelligent and (unlike the Horta) had the ability to communicate easily with humans. When the Enterprise arrived it could have simply appeared in its natural form and explained its need for salt. Crater must have told it that the Enterprise could supply it in large quantities. When the Enterprise arrived, it no longer had to kill to survive.Given the Federation's (and Kirk's) usual tolerance toward other life forms, especially those being contacted for the first time, it would undoubtedly have been given enough salt for a lifetime.It probably would even have been forgiven for murdering Nancy Crater, just as the Horta was forgiven for murdering many more. Both creatures, natives of their worlds, had only been trying to survive after the humans arrived uninvited.Yet instead of simply asking for salt, it immediately began to hunt the Enterprise crew for relatively trivial amounts. And it continued even after the humans discovered its nature and began to methodically hunt it down. Why?Maybe it really was ""evil"", as another reviewer suggests. But I think that label should be reserved for entities that act out of pure malice rather than from a survival instinct. Would we humans like to be considered ""evil"" and worthy of genocide by some highly advanced life form that has learned to live directly on stellar energy because our survival still depends on killing other life forms, plants, at the very least?In this case a simple death wish seems more likely. It was, after all, the last of its kind. Unless it could reproduce by parthenogenesis (or had a cache of eggs hidden somewhere) its species was doomed already. Maybe it figured it had nothing to live for.Yet Kirk and crew are still culpable. Yes, they had the right to defend themselves. But consider how the episode ends. The creature had been stunned by a phaser and was no longer a threat. It could have been easily captured at that point; everyone knew it was a shape shifter, so that trick would no longer work. Yet McCoy -- of all people! -- deliberately shot again and killed it. Was that a ""justifiable shooting""? I think not.""Devil in the Dark"" was the MUCH better episode.",6
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",Buffalo Woman,"The premiere of Star Trek under the reign of Captain Kirk starts off promisingly enough with this episode. There is a good combination of character development as well as plot line here. The dilemma over endangered species and their right to survival, regardless of their threat level, is always a delicate subject and the script does a fine job with the material. The added layer of old flames reunited is also a nice touch.",7
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",Shatner was right,"In his book ""Star Trek Memories,"" William Shatner lamented that out of the first few Trek episodes filmed, the network made the mistake of choosing to start the series off with the worst of the bunch. He was right, although it isn't all bad. But it was the weakest of the first few episodes by far, and not the best way to start the series.There is something I actually like about this episode which some other Trek-heads don't like; this is one of the few Trek installments which actually recognizes that there are some beings that are truly evil and malevolent, regardless of how intelligent they are (as opposed to Roddenberry's usual ""there is no good or bad there is only that which we don't yet understand"" rap), and that sometimes the only thing you can do with evil is take it out. But some hard core Trek fans wring their hands about how terrible it was that Kirk and company just killed this poor misunderstood intelligent creature which was the last of its kind, instead of trying to understand it. Unfortunately, this wasn't a situation like The Devil in the Dark, where a normally peaceful creature was pushed to murdering miners who were destroying her eggs. Case and point: Kirk and his crew hadn't been down on the planet for 10 minutes when this thing proceeds to suck the life out of a member of his crew with no provocation. And this was after a year or two of peaceful association with Professor Crater. 'Nuff said.",5
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",Excellent Start To The Series,"First of all I was born in the eighties and saw the Star Trek movies first but then a few years ago I bought the original series box set as I wanted to see the original series and see how it compared to the movies. The first episode shown, and the 6th made is The Man Trap. I love this episode very much and really recommend it. The way it begins is a great mystery when Kirk, McCoy and Darnell all see Nancy in a different form and you're like, what the hell is going on? It captures the attention immediately and the story gradually opens up and starts revealing itself and we quickly learn there is no Nancy and it's really a shape shifting creature. The dialogue is very good and the characters of Kirk, McCoy and Spock are quickly established and Alfred Ryder is excellent as Professor Crater, who is very eager for Kirk and friends to leave his planet at once, the reason not entirely obvious at first but we later learn it's because he doesn't want Kirk to find out the truth about the creature, which he nearly killed but now wants to keep around. I really enjoyed this episode and although it is a bit slow in places, I can't really fault it. Glen's rating - 9/10",9

"" But I will *DISCLAIMER: this is done with the utmost fun/love so any of you TREKKIES out there that feel the need to zip off a hasty/indignant reply with headings like: ""How dare you nit-pick a cherished franchise!""

13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",First Broadcast Episode. One of the Best!,"A prime example that ""less is more"" shows what can be done with a limited budget on a weekly TV series. The ""salt vampire"" is quite well-done as a ""rubber suit"" monster, and was on display at the old ""Star Trek"" exhibit in Las Vegas. Thankfully, they abandoned the ""monster of the week"" concept almost at once on Star Trek. (Often used on the tacky ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" series.) The major makeup goof here is the blood on Mr. Spock. Both green and red blood appear on his forehead and face. Too bad the ""Television Code"" kicked in here: ""All murderous beings must die"". Poor ""Nancy""! Like ""What are Little Girls Made Of"", one of the very best first season ""TOS"" episodes!",9
14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",Nancy Crater is not what she seems,"This, the first episode to be broadcast, opens with Kirk, McCoy and Crewman Darnell beaming down to a planet so that its sole inhabitants; Professor Crater and his wife Nancy can undergo there mandatory annual medical. It becomes clear that something strange is going on when we are introduced to Nancy; McCoy, who had a fling with her many years before, sees her as an attractive young brunette, Kirk sees her as the same woman but older and Darnell sees her as a curvaceous blonde! When Nancy goes to find her husband Darnell follows and is soon dead; his face covered in strange makings. Nancy says that she saw him eating a poisonous plant but was too late to stop him. When the professor joins them he seems overly keen for them to leave; saying they don't need a check-up, all they need is a fresh supply of salt tablets. Kirk isn't willing to leave it at that and later returns with Spock and crewmen Sturgeon and Green. Soon the two crewmen are also dead but when Kirk calls out to them Nancy takes on the form of Green and joins them. The three of them return to the Enterprise and it is clear that 'Green' is desperate for salt... the mineral which test showed was missing from Darnell's body.While this wasn't intended to be the first episode of the new series it serves well enough in the role as it introduces most of the regular cast. Obviously viewing it now it loses some of its impact as we know that regular cast members are in no real danger but when first broadcast it is unlikely viewers would have known who were destined to become secondary characters and who was expendable! The special effects weren't bad for their time but inevitably they have dated over the years as has the scenery which looks very basic to fans of the more recent series. Having first watched this series in the seventies that didn't bother me; it gave it a nostalgic charm. The story is pretty decent with a memorable monster. As well as the drama there is some humour as Uhuru flirts with the emotionless Vulcan; Science Officer Spock and the banter between Yeoman Rand and Sulu... scenes not necessitated by the plot but which helped to introduce the characters various personalities.The fact that this wasn't shown in the correct ordered wouldn't really have mattered as there is very little continuity between episodes; each story stands on its own and anybody we haven't seen before is unlikely to be seen again!",8
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",not-bad start for series,"Observation about the first dozen or so ST episodes produced- Kirk is more of an authority figure than he would be later, less friendly with the rest of the crew, more likely to bite someone's head off over a minor transgression, as he does in 'The Man Trap' with McCoy. Spock too is more business-like; the advice he gives to the Captain tends to be terse and to-the-point. In fact, the whole structure of the show and life aboard the Enterprise in particular is much more military-oriented, unlike later episodes where there is a more casual feel and easygoing interaction among the crew members. And in the very early shows, like 'The Man Trap', there is a certain stiffness that is perhaps attributable to the above or it may simply be that the series was still finding its way. The plot revisits the idea of a race of creatures with the power of illusion as in the original pilot 'The Cage,' except here there is only one surviving member left. During a routine planetary stop to visit a research station and check on its two inhabitants, Dr. Crater and his wife Nancy, the creature kills an Enterprise crewman. No one realizes at the time that the creature is impersonating Nancy, who in reality is dead, as well as various crewmembers as the episode progresses. Crater has accepted the creature as a replacement for Nancy and so protects it. Finally the truth is admitted by Crater and in an exciting scene in McCoy's quarters, the creature reveals its true, ghastly appearance and is killed. Though the sixth Trek episode produced, 'The Man Trap' was the first episode aired on NBC and so served as the series' introduction to millions of people on September 8, 1966. What they saw was a genuinely oddball installment, in some ways typical and in some ways not, but it may have misled some to think this new 'Star Trek' was going to be more 'monster-oriented' than it in fact turned out to be. (Leonard Nimoy has said at the time he was concerned about this.) Still, it was a satisfactory and at times exciting start to the new sci-fi series.",6
16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",This episode sucks....literally.,"Okay, you Trekkie/Trekker trivia freaks, this is the first Star Trek episode that was aired, even though it was not the first filmed. Apparently, NBC wanted a ""bug-eyed monster"" episode and made them show this one first since it features a giant body-changing sucking hairy monster. The problem is that despite having the monster, there really isn't all that much to recommend the episode. It's pretty dull and a terrible way to initiate the series. Not among the very worst, but far, far from the best.Strengths are the monster itself--it looked cool and compared to later episodes, the production values are pretty good. Negatives were the incredibly low energy of everyone in the episode (I actually would have welcomed some of Kirk's hysterics) and the static nature of the episode. It should have been more exciting and probably reflects the newness of the show. Later episodes would be smoother--with better and more natural action and dialog. Regardless, it is fun to watch and the show won its time slot when it debuted back in the 1960s.By the way, if you watch, look carefully at the first scene. You'll see Uhura at the helm! Also, her dialog with Spock is very unusual- - quite good, but unusual.",7
17,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",Interesting but flawed,"This was by no means a completely horrible episode, but it was deeply flawed. The episode did raise interesting points about extinction and the battle of species for survival; unfortunately, the arguments in favor of the creature didn't really hold up.Basically, the Enterprise crew encounter the last surviving member of an alien race that requires salt to survive. Unfortunately, the creature has a penchant for killing humans as its source of salt. The Enterprise crew is faced with the problem of dealing with a dangerous predator in its midst. The creature's complicit human companion seeks to preserve its life as the last surviving member of its species.But the arguments against extinction and the need to preserve life just don't hold up with this particular creature. It kills far too easily, even killing its loyal companion who had refused to help Kirk find it. It is intelligent enough to easily have survived without killing-- by revealing its true nature and consuming salt from non-living sources-- it even acknowledges the possibility of doing so while impersonating McCoy-- yet it chooses to continue killing for salt. The totally unnecessary murder of its companion was the real clincher that the creature could not be trusted. The creature is sort of the alien equivalent of a sociopath, except its total lack of cunning fortunately makes it rather easy to detect and destroy (despite McCoy's dull-wittedness here). The Enterprise crew really have no choice other than to kill it, and ample justification for doing so.The ethical issue would have been far more interesting if the creature could ONLY survive via salt from humans, for some reason, which would make killing others necessary for its survival rather than a mere convenience. Then there would, indeed, be a more complex dilemma involved.The archaeologist character that remains loyal to the creature, even until it kills him (and quite unnecessarily, since he could have easily accessed unlimited salt for it, at that point, via the ship's technology) is a peculiar nutcase himself who inexplicably helps a murderous monster. His sympathy for the creature is difficult to understand, considering it killed his wife. The suggestion here is that he is obtaining sexual favors from the creature, which can seemingly assume any form, which makes him just as guilty.I just couldn't feel sorry for the creature or the archaeologist; the creature could have peacefully co-existed but chose to kill instead, and he is strangely compliant in its murderous actions.Some interesting characters bits here. The show was remarkably sexist in the interactions of Rand and Uhura with the male cast members-- I suppose it's somewhat understandable given the time this show was made, but it's remarkably dated now. Both come across more as flighty distractions than as competent crew members.",5
18,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",Unexpected hostility,"Star Trek's debut episode has the Enterprise going to a remote planet where Alfred Ryder and his wife Jeanne Bal who is DeForest Kelley's old girlfriend are doing research. They are met with an unexpected hostility from Ryder who orders them away and asks that enormous quantity of salt be left. A few Enterprise crewman die and a chameleon like creature gets on the Enterprise. Ryder knows what's going on, but won't spill. In fact his relationship with Jeanne Bal is positively freaky.The creature needs salt to live and when it can't get it, it kills to drain the salt from the human body. Leonard Nimoy's different anatomy as a Vulcan gave it something unexpected and not welcome in what I thought was the best scene in the show.Not one of the better episodes in the show, but better was to come.",5
19,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",Classic Star Trek-The Man Trap,"""The Man Trap"" is a bonafide ""Bones episode"" where he's the character mainly centered around as a creature which can alter its appearance to any lifeform ""she"" uses the identity of Dr. McCoy's former flame, a woman who married a grumpy scientist named Professor Robert Crater (Alfred Ryder), living on a planet the Enterprise orbits (Kirk's Enterprise is ordered to make routine stops to ensure that scientists are in proper health). The creature (and boy is this thing ugly when we see what it really looks like!) lives on salt and is compelled to kill humans for what it craves, seemingly unable to control the hunger. When Kirk's men start to become victims of this salt monster, he will seek it out to kill it. McCoy's life could be in grave danger as he still has feelings for the woman he believes is Nancy (Jeanne Bal), not knowing that a monster is merely using her face as a disguise. If you are familiar with Star Trek, then you know that extras were used all the time to accompany Kirk and Spock to service the show as victims for whatever dangers exist on planets they transport to—this show is a fine example of that as many extras wind up dried of their salt at the hands of the creature, little suction spots on their faces to depict where the ""sucking"" took place. Seeing McCoy grappling with his emotions as the monster, at first in the form of Nancy, is attacking Kirk is quite eyepopping because you see just how much Bones cared for the woman. Funny scene where Uhura complains to Spock about the word ""frequency"" and interesting exchange between the two when she scolds him for his cold reaction to the death of an officer reported from the planet. Hilarious phaser stun sequence where Kirk must subdue Crater who is firing at them with a laser gun, the way it sounds and how he is knocked for a loop. We get to look inside Sulu's living quarters and see that he has a variety of ""alien flowers"", one which is frightened of the salt creature who has assumed the disguise of an officer she killed. This is not one of the show's very best episodes, as the monster is a bit silly looking, but I imagine there's plenty of entertainment for fans of creature features. If anything, I thought it was nice to see Bones allowed to have the plot focused more on him for a change.",7
20,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)","There she blows, Cap'n !","In spite of many other critics (including cast) who argue this is the worst episode to start the series, I disagree - I think the producers tackle the subject head on - other commentators have described the antagonist here as the Salt Vampire - but I think what we have here is a Fellatio Fiend - or a BJ Monster. The fact that the BJ Monster only targets male crew members should be a dead giveaway - I'm not well versed in biology, but it is my guess that the typical female human contains as much salt as a male; and yet no female crew member is targeted. If it was only salt the BJ Monster required why doesn't it shape shift into a respected crew member, visit the mess deck and request a meal with extra salt - or shape shift into the Quartermaster and consume all the salt in ship's stores? - answer is easy - this is a sex story (like almost every other episode of this series) where the author is obviously trying to warn males about the pitfalls of succumbing to oral sex - and why on Earth anyone would want to tune in to a TV show preaching about nutritionin the 1960s - Heaven knows they're intolerable enough now. The sceneshowing the BJ Monster revealed in all her goo goo eyed open gob glory with fangs no male with or without a foreskin could ever extricate himself says everything in five seconds - a masterpiece of television. And is it too far fetched to say does the BJ Monster bear a passing resemblance the the Morlock in The Time Machine (1960) ?",6
21,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",Needs More Sugar,"In this, the first Star Trek episode to air (but not the first to be produced), a shape-shifting monster stalks the Enterprise in search of salt. We begin with Kirk, Bones and Crewman Darnell beaming down to examine Professor Robert Crater and his wife Nancy, the only inhabitants among the ruins of Planet M-113. Nancy is Bones' ex, the ""one that got away"" and it seems her physical appearance is different to each man who looks upon her. Crewman Darnell, badly in need of a cold shower, sees Nancy as a cheap blonde from Wrigley's Pleasure Planet, which is coincidentally the site of my next vacation. Sadly the idiot follows her off to meet his doom before the opening credits. Darnell, we hardly knew ye.Professor Crater balks at the medical exam as he and Bones engage in a Battle of Crank. McCoy eventually wins out, but his exam is interrupted by the discovery of Darnell's dead body, which is marked with red circles. Bones debuts his catchphrase: ""He's dead, Jim,"" which is not an encouraging jingle for a doctor, and Nancy asks for more salt tablets. (Please don't forget the salt tablets)Back on the Enterprise Uhura is toying with Spock. Or maybe ""taunting"" is a more appropriate term. She tries flirting with him, tries engaging him emotionally- she even tries to get a reaction out of him by suggesting Kirk is dead. This might seem rather cruel on her part, but it might be understood that this an early episode and a way to introduce the concept of Spock's unemotional nature. Darnell's death is a mystery until Bones realizes there's absolutely no salt in his body- maybe he was on a low-sodium diet?Kirk insists on taking the Professor and his wife aboard the ship but another dead body is discovered, victim of the salt monster. Nancy assumes the form of deceased crewman Green and boards the Enterprise, where she targets perpetual victim Janice Rand, or at least her shaker of salt. Nancy's cover is almost blown by a hand-plant in Sulu's space terrarium, so she assumes the form of a black crew member who hits on Uhura in a very strange sequence. Then she's back to Nancy, lulling Bones to sleep so that she might suck out his salt in his slumber. I'm getting a scorecard. Kirk and Spock take Crater by force and he reveals the mystery of the salt monster. During a briefing on board the ship he admits he can see the creature in whatever form it takes but refuses to identify it. The last few minutes of this episode get ugly, with out-of-character behavior and sloppy writing. First, the fact that neither Kirk nor Spock can see that Bones is the salt monster is rather lame. They are both aware that the creature is currently impersonating a crew member- would they not be suspicious of Bones' odd behavior? Would they not factor in his history with the missing woman? And I can buy the conceit that the salt monster can assume any form but how could it gain the knowledge necessary to successfully impersonate all these people, most of all a starship doctor?Nancy returns to Bones' quarters where the good doctor defies his Captain's orders- unlikely- and then acts as a human shield- absurd- even After Nancy is revealed as the monster. Completing this mess is Spock breaking into the room excited and emotional- extremely un-Vulcan- screaming at McCoy to shoot and then bitch-slapping Nancy like a pimp on Saturday night. Finally Bones concedes- because the episode's over- and kills the fiendish salt beast. This episode is not a very good example of Star Trek, ironic since it was aired as the show's premiere. I wonder what the core idea was here, and where it went off-track. Was the salt monster supposed to represent Woman, transfixing a man with her appearance and then stealing his ""essence""? A stretch on my part. ""The Man Trap"" plays more like horror than sci-fi, and it fails to touch on any of the ideals or sense of wonder that would soon come to be the hallmark of the show. Still, I love the image of the monster in its pure form... GRADE: C-",
22,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",He's dead Jim,Typical of the original Star Trek episodes where everything eventually revolves around Captain James T. Kirk. Great fun to watch Shatner overact in nearly every scene.,6
23,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",Dr. McCoy's Old Flame,"Nancy Crater and Dr. McCoy at one time was very close... it's been years since they've seen each other. Naturally Bones was excited to find out he'll see Nancy again while on the planet M-113. Nancy has gotten married to Professor Robert Crater, a man that knows all about Nancy. Nancy is not quite her old self, trying to harm the Starship Crew for Salt.Off to a great start with the first season, first episode of ST-TOS. It is taken very much seriously - nothing cutesy or funny about it. Like all Star Trek TOS - you'll either like the Captain and Crew or you simply won't.Oddly, this episode looks and feels like a later episode... one that you know the characters better rather than the very first episode aired for TV audiences in 1966.7/10",7
24,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Man Trap (TV Episode 1966)",The first episode? Not impressed!,"I was disappointed in this episode. I expected the first episode to have an exceptional plot, this one was just so-so in my opinion. They could have used ""Nancy""'s ability to change appearance to greater advantage by having even more changes by her to different crew members. Plus, when they had her look gray-haired - when seen by McCoy - a few times it ruined the shape-shifting effect.",6
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Charlie X (TV Episode 1966)",I'm Not a Man and I Can Do Anything - you can't,"Though this was aired in front of ""Where No Man Has Gone Before,"" it's not the first Trek story to feature a human being acquiring extraordinary powers - that would be the aforementioned 2nd pilot for the show. The angle with this episode is that the human being in question is a teenager, 17-year-old Charles Evans (well played by actor Walker, in his mid-twenties at the time). It's bad enough when adults get delusions of godhood; when it's a teen, all bets are off. Kirk brings on a sector worth of trouble on board his ship when he accepts a transfer of a young guest from a smaller ship. The Charlie character spent all his years up to this point on some planet without other human beings. His introduction to the fairer sex (Yeoman Rand - probably Whitney's best episode) is painful in itself; his growing pains are accentuated by his complete ignorance of common social customs.All this is uncomfortable to watch because Walker imparts an uneasy, twitchy psychosis to his character but then, in the second half of the episode, he reveals his unlimited powers - he literally seems able to do anything, whether making people disappear or transforming them into lizards. The story now begins to take on a more horrific tone; in his frustration, Charlie is not beyond torturing crew members, terrorizing the entire ship. This is alienation taken to the nth degree. The episode makes a strong case for the issue of parental control - even more on the topic of maturing without parents (think of the story of Superman/Clark Kent, for example, and if he'd grown up without the influence of the Kents; this has been on display for the past few years on the series ""Smallville""). In this particular episode, the parental duties fall on Kirk, but it's too little too late - far too late. One drawback of this episode: an extended scene of Uhura singing about Spock and then Charlie - the one point that Charlie's surreptitious use of his powers seemed warranted.As with most of the Trek episodes in the original series, the strongly structured scripts included excellent endings, as is the case here. There are no pat unrealistic conclusions, i.e. a happy ending, where-in Charlie is somehow able to remain with the human race (due to the miraculous removal of his powers, for example). No, even in this sector of space, you reap what you sow and things are not solved for you. There's a genuinely tragic tone to the ending - Charlie's main weakness, after all, was just a great need for other people to like him. That need will never be fulfilled at the end. As with the previously aired ""Man Trap,"" total incompatibility between two sets of entities shows that some things are beyond our ability to set right, even with future technology.",7
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Charlie X (TV Episode 1966)","Bit of a naughty boy, that Charlie...","After the salt-eating ""monster"" of The Man Trap, the original Star Trek deals with the concept of psychic powers for the first time, an element that occurs on several occasions throughout the series. The first story to deal with that topic, Charlie X, lacks the philosophical relevance of later episodes (it's just a traditional monster-of-the-week tale), but succeeds in delivering thrills and suspense.Continuing its travels through space, the Enterprise picks up a young boy, Charlie Evans, who's used to having everything his way, a fact that becomes a source of embarrassment when he gets too interested in Yeoman Rand (Grace Lee Whitney). Kirk tries to explain that such behavior is inappropriate, but has to face a greater danger than he imagined when he discovers the boy's powers enable him to create - and destroy - anything.With hindsight, Charlie X can be seen as a tamer version of Stephen King's novel Carrie, which was memorably brought to the screen by Brian De Palma. Like King's story, this Trek episode uses the gimmick of mental abilities to deal with a teenager's inner struggles and confusion. Unlike Carrie, however, Charlie is underdeveloped and occasionally annoying, his actions bordering on stereotype. Luckily, the thriller pace of the episode keeps things from getting boring, and there's always the Shatner/Nimoy double act to rely on. In other words, it's vintage Star Trek.",8
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Charlie X (TV Episode 1966)",The danger of having an adolescent with godlike powers aboard the Enterprise,"Kirk should have been suspicious of his new passenger, seventeen year old Charlie, as soon as he beamed aboard; the two men who escorted him seemed unusually keen to get off the Enterprise. Charlie was the sole survivor when a cargo ship crashed on the planet Thasus fourteen years previously; he claims to have survived by eating wild fruit and learnt about how to live from the ship's computer. McCoy is sceptical and suggests that somebody must have raised him. Charlie doesn't know how to behave in company and is soon making inappropriate advances towards Yeoman Rand. Sometime later the ship that brought him to the Enterprise tries to make contact but explodes before it can deliver a message. Charlie clearly has telekinetic powers but it takes a while before this becomes obvious to the crew. By then it is obvious that he is very dangerous; he makes those who upset him disappear and being a teenaged boy it doesn't take much to upset him.This is a really good early Star Trek episode; Charlie is a distinctly creepy antagonist even before his god-like powers are revealed he slaps Yeoman Rand on the backside, although this could be put down to him not knowing what behaviour is acceptable and what isn't. Guest star Robert Walker Jr. does a good job portraying this troubled and dangerous youth. Grace Lee Whitney also puts in a notable performance as Ensign Rand; it was nice to see her playing a major role in the story. The ending is a little surprising; after it is revealed that Charlie was taught how to use these powers by beings on Thasus they come to take him back and Kirk argues that he should grow up with his own kind an odd suggestion given how dangerous he has proved to be and regular humans are hardly his kind any more. Overall an interesting story and a disturbing antagonist make for a fine episode.",9
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Charlie X (TV Episode 1966)",The Wonder Years,"A young man with strange powers hitches a ride on the Enterprise. His name is Charles Evans- Charlie to you and me- and as the sole survivor of a crash he has been alone on a deserted planet for fourteen years. But making Charlie's return to society more difficult is his mysterious godlike abilitiesThis episode is almost certainly a metaphor for puberty/adolescence: it's the awkward stage taken to the exaggerated extreme. Charlie is the uncertain, stumbling teen- a lusty man one moment and a spiteful child the next. He's flexing his newfound muscles and does not yet realize his own strength. And who should be the object of Charlie's first crush? Why it's none other than Yeoman Janice Rand, intergalactic chew toy and perpetual victim. (Poor Janice- is she cursed?) Charlie reaches for her ample backside but is reprimanded because he has not taken her to Olive Garden first. Kirk is asked to step in as the boy's father figure but he neatly weasels his way out of the job, ""delegating"" the task back to Spock and Bones.Next we have the single most mystifying sequence in the first season of the show: Uhura's cafeteria cabaret performance. She's in uniform, in front of the entire crew, singing to Spock's funky harp jam and serenading Charlie until he uses his power to destroy her vocal chords. (We owe you one, Chuck.) Why did anyone think a musical number would be appropriate here? This always stood out as strange to me. Charlie demonstrates his gifts by performing card tricks for Janice, who suddenly seems less upset about the ass-grabbing in Corridor B.If Kirk's advice to Charlie (""There's no right way to hit a woman"") is less than romantic at least it's well-intentioned, but father-son time is over as the ship which brought Charlie aboard is suddenly- and mysteriously- destroyed. Next Charlie loses to Spock at chess and melts the pieces in frustration. At this point it's impossible not to draw a parallel between this story and the ""It's A Good Life"" episode of The Twilight Zone, in which a small town is terrorized by a young boy with unlimited powers. Were the Trek writers unconsciously copying that story? Consciously copying it? We may never know. Back on the ship Charlie pursues Janice and her giant beehive because she ""smells like a girl"" and she makes him ""hungry, all over."" Down, boy.Kirk pulls Charlie aside for a verbal hose-down and then tries to beat the puberty out of him with a gymnastics routine that evidently consists of slamming your body against the mat as hard as you possibly can. (This is the secret to the Captain's bodacious physique.) Charlie doesn't seem to enjoy it and begins to vanquish crew members to oblivion, and in short order he's taken command of the Enterprise. We cut to Janice in her quarters: she's alone, in her nightie, writing a letter to Starfleet requesting a transfer to another ship. Then Charlie comes barging in, cornering her, hitting on her hard, and wishing her away when she rejects him. Next the boy goes on a ship-wide tirade, forcing a female crew member through a one-minute menopause and punishing another for laughing by evidently gluing a pancake to her face. (Tough but fair.) Kirk tries to overwhelm Charlie's abilities but suddenly an alien vessel appears and power is restored to the ship, with missing crew members magically returned. In this final act an almost literal deus ex machina is used to resolve the plot: a ""god"" appears on the bridge and simply takes Charlie away. It is a disappointing and confusing resolution to an otherwise fine episode, and raises some major plot questions. (If these aliens gave Charlie magic powers in order to survive why didn't they just rescue him? If they're omnipotent why did they allow him to get out of control in the first place?) You can't write a story this good and then just press the Reset button when you run out of time... it's too bad because ""Charlie X"" deserved an ending.GRADE: B-",
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Charlie X (TV Episode 1966)",Remember When Teenagers Were Expected To Learn Things and Grow Up?,"I really hated this episode as a teenager, and it's not hard to figure out why. The teenage ""hero"" is stereotyped as a big, spoiled baby. Charlie X acts like a weak, whiny brat, (as if all teenagers are like that) and he keeps sulking about how ""being a grown up isn't everything"" and how he could run the Enterprise if he had the chance. But he never shows any character, intelligence, or leadership. Even when he gets ""magic powers"" it only serves to underline the fact that he's still a child and not a man.Now I'm fifty three, and in a way I feel almost nostalgic for this episode. I mean, Charlie X is exactly who I was at that age -- he's totally self-pitying, and he expects things to be handed to him. He has a wonderful role model in Kirk, (a lot better than my old man) but instead of trying to learn and taking his knocks he goes over the top and starts blasting people for no reason! Even Yeoman Rand tries to fix him up with a cute junior girl volunteer (who really was gorgeous, by the way) but Charlie doesn't want to know. Now that I'm in my fifties I no longer feel that Charlie is getting a raw deal. In fact in a lot of ways I think he gets off very lightly! The hard lesson of the show is that growing up means you have to stop thinking of yourself as a victim and start listening to what other people have to teach you. Now all that is just one man's story, and probably not very interesting to most people. But I have to share something really funny about the way STAR TREK has changed. When I went out and bought the complete original series on Blu Ray, it was one of the happiest days of my life. It's been such a thrill watching all the old episodes in perfect condition! But some discs have these really annoying commercials to start them off. The disc with Charlie X on it has a trailer for one of the new, horrendously bad Star Trek movies -- the kind where a very spoiled, pouting James Dean lookalike (young Jim Kirk, if you please) is zooming around on his motorcycle, blowing off all the grown ups and their stupid rules (like the speed limit), and then suddenly he's in command of the Enterprise because ""they"" are blown away by his ""potential."" I guess you could say Charlie X has got his revenge at last!",7
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Charlie X (TV Episode 1966)","""That wasn't nice...""","I never liked this one. So far, this is the first one I shut it off halfway thru, and watched the rest the following day.I have a lot of trouble believing Robert Walker as a 17-year-old. He looks more like 25 to me-- at least.One thing I will say... like a number of early ST episodes, this is works MUCH better if you see the thing UNCUT. There is SO MUCH detail in Gene Roddenberry's half-year run as producer that completely went by the wayside when Gene Coon took over and made the show more ""adventure"" style, more ""viewer-friendly"", more network-budget-conscious. (""Do we really need all these extras walking around the sets all the time? See if you can cut them out and save a few thousand a week."")CHARLIE X seems to be one of several variations of a theme running thru a number of sci-fi series, that of someone with uncanny power who can't control themselves or their power. One of the most well-known is no doubt IT'S A GOOD LIFE from THE TWILIGHT ZONE (which was remade as part of the '83 feature film). It almost feels like a thematic ""sequel"" to WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE, showing what might have happened if Gary Mitchell had remained on board The Enterprise longer. It was monstrously STUPID of NBC to schedule these 2 similar stories back-to-back, with the 2nd one being run 1st! (Doing so must have completely undercut the impact of WHERE NO MAN..., just as having an atomic bomb in the film GOLDFINGER, I feel, undercuts the entire plot of the follow-up film THUNDERBALL.)The theme was returned to half a year later with THE SQUIRE OF GOTHOS, with the punch line being nobody realized until the end they were dealing with an adolescent (or was it just a ""child"" there who just happened to look like a middle-aged man?). I never cared for that when it first aired, but as the decades have gone by, I've come to enjoy it more and more. I usually find myself wondering, COULD someone have gotten along with Trelane with the right attitude about the situation? Maybe not... but maybe.Charlie strikes me as much more arrogant and annoying in his attitude even than Trelane. He keeps saying things like, ""That wasn't nice..."" I wonder why nobody didn't say those exact words to HIM??? I have the feeling the only proper course with him would have been , EARLY on, to have given him a lesson in morality that seems to be MISSING from the vast majority of today's young people. ""Treat others as you would be treated."" Surely, ALL rules of society behavior stem from that single, important, simple concept. Yet countless people seem completely unaware of it. Including this ""boy"".For at least the 2nd episode in the run, Uhura was seen to be flirting with Spock, when she sings to him in the rec room as he plays (our first view of his lyre). I LIKE this early Spock who can be seen smiling at moments when he's relaxed and with friends. To me, it makes the inner ""conflict"" spoken of in WHERE NO MAN..., NAKED TIME, etc. all the more obvious. Later, it seems he was completely repressing his human side, controlling it. Here, he seems more comfortable with it. He only shows it when he's around certain people, like Jim, or Uhura (never McCoy though-- heh).Uhura got the short shrift when Coon took over. No wonder she wanted to quit the show after the 1st season. All her best scenes on the series were in that first half-season!Add to her Janice Rand and Christine Chapel, and you had 3 very different, very dynamic women characters on the show at once. Clearly, too much for the networks. Janice is all femininity and sex appeal; Christine is more intelligence and sensitivity; Uhuru is playful and earthy at the same time.This episode, by the way, was remade the following year on LOST IN SPACE as THE HAUNTED LIGHTHOUSE. (I'm not kidding!) Naturally, the LIS version had a happier ending.",5
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Charlie X (TV Episode 1966)",Why this is a great episode,"Pacing. Yes Pacing. That is what makes this and other first year Trex episodes seem real. Yeah! Real! Like you are really there. Like, You are a person in our time privileged to see into the future. It may seem trivial, but that is what so many of the modern Treks lack. They don't give you the feeling you are in the future or in space or anything. Just a PC college campus at Halloween. The right pacing makes the people come alive as real - like me and you.

As time goes along, he begins to alienate the crew. The ship that left him off is destroyed. Signs are pointing to this kid having something to do with these things. As things play out, he becomes more and more impatient and reactionary. When laughed at during judo training, he makes his teacher disappear. He terrorizes the crew and needs to be controlled. Robert Walker, Jr. is startlingly spooky as Charlie. If one wants to find a bit of a comparison, think of the Twilight Zone episode where the little boy can send people off to a cornfield. People begin to speak to him differently because they are frightened. The use of creatures who know no bounds creates issues. The petulance of this person makes him ten times more terrifying.

8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Charlie X (TV Episode 1966)","""You've got my ship and I want it back!""","One of the cool things about watching Star Trek in series order so many years after their original airing is watching the character development from show to show. I say this as a casual fan and not a Trekkie per se, who probably have all this stuff down pat. The curious thing I found here is Uhura's follow up to her flirtation with Spock in the series opener, 'The Man Trap'. This time she has some fun at Spock's expense by serenading him in 'Satan's guise - with devil's ears and devil's eyes'. The rest of the crew present seem to get a kick out of it too; I guess they weren't ready yet for Spock's logical and non-emotional character that would begin to emerge in the next episode.But this one's about Charlie X (Robert Walker Jr.) and the Enterprise's first challenge in the far reaches of outer space. The story provides Captain Kirk's first 'Whoa' moment when he stares down potential annihilation and makes Charlie blink to his authority. Which in retrospect, makes me wonder why Kirk couldn't offer a convincing argument to why a seventeen year old shouldn't be slapping an older woman on the butt. And why he couldn't effectively read the body language of Charlie and the cargo vessel captain when the story opened. You would expect him to be sharper than that.The story uses a device other reviewers on this board have commented on, the one used in the third season episode of The Twilight Zone in 'It's a Good Life'. Billy Mumy sent his victims into the 'corn field', but no explanation is offered here as to where Charlie sent the Enterprise folks. That was handled a bit too sloppily for my taste - was only Yeoman Rand brought back from oblivion? I guess Charlie's first crush deserved special treatment.Well we learn a couple of cool things in this episode. There are four hundred twenty eight crew members on the Enterprise, and we see the three dimensional chess game for the first time. There was also Kirk's reference to UESPA - not being up on my Star Trek lore, I'll have to wait to find out what that stands for. I'm also curious how Kirk's going to replace all those phasers that Charlie made disappear!",7
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Charlie X (TV Episode 1966)","Aside from making a woman's face disappear, there's little to love about this episode","With only one or two exceptions, the lousiest episodes of the original STAR TREK were those where they were stuck on the ship. This often had the tendency to make the shows very static and slow compared to others and CHARLIE X is no exception.Robert Walker, Jr. (who looked a lot like his ill-fated father) plays Charlie--a horny and misunderstood young man who is supposedly discovered alone on a planet--the lone survivor of an earlier expedition. Instead of having Charlie discovered by the Enterprise, I think they just had him beam over from another ship to save on expenses for filming the episode. Charlie seems too normal for a kid who mostly raised himself (like Mowgli). Oddness, though not immediately apparent, is indeed present. It seems that Charlie has psychic powers and soon begins to act like a spoiled baby with dark powers (a lot like Billy Mumy from the Twilight Zone series where he terrorized a small farming town with his mental abilities). Most of what Charlie does isn't all that scary (such as having someone turn into an iguana--and not even showing the transformation), though I really loved when he was royally ticked off and overheard people laughing--and made their faces disappear (you see one of these people--a woman grasping about the ship). However, what really makes this a bad episode is the ending where the ultra-powerful spirits who made Charlie the way he is came back to retrieve him. Despite having totally terrorized the crew and killed many of them, Kirk begs the spirits to let Charlie stay with the humans!!!!! No way does this make any sense and frankly, I would have loved to see Charlie get killed to end his reign of terror.",5
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Charlie X (TV Episode 1966)","Corny, but good","Every time Charlie scrunches his face up to use his ""powers"", I laughed inside a bit, it's some very canny acting, for sure, and a reminder of how different, tonally, sci-fi was in the 60s compared to today. This is great stuff, either way: the character of Charlie was well-written for what was needed and plays out well (if predictable...I've definitely seen this sort of character before, and he certainly didn't scare me). After a pilot and first episode with female-led guests (both as potential girlfriends for various members of the crew), I enjoyed seeing a male guest star whose romantic interactions are less successful than in previous episodes :-P",7
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Charlie X (TV Episode 1966)",Teenage Angst,"In this episode, Charlie learns a few valuable lessons that all young adults must learn: you're not as important as you believe yourself to be, your actions have consequences, and you're not invincible. Even at the height of his power, Charlie still has someone above him who causes his empire to come crashing down on top of him as all these lessons hit home.As young adults, we often consider ourselves practically invincible, with no regard for the feelings of others. During our first years a freedom, many become narcissistically self-focused and act rashly, similarly to how Charlie is. Who knows how the world would be different today if we had a bunch of young Charlies running around.One problem with this episode is that we never really find out if Charlie understands what he did was wrong. He gets whisked away by the Thasian ship, complaining of their lack of physical substance. Does he have the capabilities to become a changed, more mature man or will he always be this man-child who bullies his way to get what he wants?This episode's a bit corny, especially when the camera zooms in on Charlie as his eyes roll back but it's still enjoyable to watch and shows young viewers the consequences of reckless actions.",7

13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Charlie X (TV Episode 1966)",Terrible episode,"I really disliked this episode. While this wasn't the worst TV episode I've ever seen and is not even the worst episode of the series, it's still, well, pretty bad, however you slice it.The basic premise here is that the Enterprise encounters a young Earth human (age 17) who has largely lived in isolation, and through unexplained alien manipulations, has immense (nearly infinite) powers. Unfortunately, he's also an immature and arrogant punk kid who casually commits murder and enjoys manipulating others, whom he can directly control to say or do as he pleases.Roddenberry had some sort of odd obsession with omnipotence or near-omnipotence. The theme returns again and again in this series and in Star Trek: TNG. Many examples: ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" (absolute power corrupting absolutely), ""The Squire of Gothos"" (very similar story to this one with a punk kid running amok), ""The Changeling"" (with Nomad, a nearly all-powerful probe), Star Trek: the Motion Picture (Vejur, a near-retread of the Nomad episode), and even ""Encounter at Farpoint"", the pilot for TNG, with the absurd and annoying ""Q"" character.While I generally am a fan of, and admire, Roddenberry's work and his vision of tolerance and decency in the future, I have to say that his peculiar obsession with all-powerful beings really wears thin, fast. Here, Charlie is basically an out-of-control teenager with absolutely no regard for others (casually kills an entire ship's crew of 20, to prevent the captain of that ship from warning the Enterprise about Charlie).There's really very little of this episode to like. Charlie is malevolent and deadly, killing, maiming, or destroying on a whim, with zero patience or tolerance and no respect whatsoever for others, and the crew is very nearly powerless to do a thing against him. This episode featured Yeoman Rand once again in her role as ship temptress, being sinisterly stalked by out-of-control Charlie. This is much worse than just having a stalker-- this is a stalker with near-infinite power and absolutely no patience or impulse control.In the end, the aliens return but, for unknown reasons, fail to just 'neuter' the vicious punk and remove his powers (which would have been the ideal solution and might have allowed for at least the remote chance for salvaging the kid). But, barring that, there really was no choice but to get rid of him. He evokes very little in the way of sympathy-- more of a feeling of 'good riddance to bad rubbish'.",2
14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Charlie X (TV Episode 1966)","""Is that a girl""","While it may have been fortunate that young Robert Walker, Jr. landed on a planet where supernatural beings gave him powers to survive, they did not exactly act as parents to him. So we have an immature 17 year old played by 26 year old Walker who has powers to create and destroy at will. Which he uses against those who don't 'like' him and that's defined rather broadly.He certainly wasn't schooled in relations with the opposite sex as he asks William Shatner whether Grace Lee Whitney was that opposite sex he's heard tell about. When the captain of the Antares got rid of Walker and foisted him on the Enterprise Shatner should have suspected something was up.In the end one of the Thasians played by Abraham Sofaer takes charge of Walker bringing him back to the only world he ever knew. Not after he's wreaked havoc on the Enterprise and its crew.This was the first of several Star Trek episodes where the Enterprise came across a race of super beings who were just not concerned with the imperial wars of the Humans, Klingons, Romulans, etc.This time I hope Sofaer and his race give Walker an education that includes the facts of life.",5
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Charlie X (TV Episode 1966)",Charlie X,"""In the hands of an adolescent..""The survey ship Antaris brings aboard a rather weird 17 year old who somehow survived on the planet Thesis for several years, even though food supplies had exhausted. This teenager, Charlie, is anti-social and more than a bit strange (he just has this air of awkwardness about him), but it doesn't stop there: he has powers that are dangerous, particularly considering he's an immature, easily tempered, quick to punish kid, seemingly unable to control his anger when someone pushes his buttons (notice what he does to Uhura who sings a ditty about him in the recreation room or the Antaris ship when the captain tries to send a warning to Kirk and the Enterprise about their unusual passenger). Spock calls Charlie's ability transmutation, a power to render objects (or humans) invisible, or to destroy if he feels threatened or angered.What a great plot! I think this is a fine of example of great storytelling. Imagine the weapon to destroy anyone or thing that aggravates, annoys, or bothers you—now, imagine a boy inside a man's body equipped with such a dangerous weapon (uh oh, is right). You have to wonder how in the dickens Kirk will get out of this difficult situation. Yep, Kirk finally figures it out, but not before Charlie runs rampant, using his powers to short circuit Uhura's console (causing a nice shock which send her reeling), force Spock against his will to quote nursery rhymes and poetry (not to mention, break his legs at one point!), cause crew members to ""go away"", turn a cute teenage girl into an iguana, age an adult female into an elderly woman, and remove a laughing officer's face(!)—Kirk has his hands full with this kid! Kirk thinks Charlie has a *limit*, that he can actually tax himself if there is an overuse of his powers. I definitely think this episode cleverly comments on the difficulty of puberty, especially if a teenager has grown up in an environment absent the human experience, his dysfunction deriving from the lack of social interaction over an extended period of time. Without the Thesian power Charlie would not have survived, but how can such a ""human anomaly"" function among others when even the least little incident causes him to kill or harm? Solid script by the always reliable DC Fontana, Robert Walker perfect as the titular character (something about him just gives you the creeps) who doesn't handle conflict or embarrassment very well. I would hate not to mention Grace Lee Whitney as Yeoman Janice Rand, a stunning woman Walker's Charlie is enamored with. Janice tries various methods to convince him she isn't the girl for him, to no avail. This plot thread is important as it pertains to Charlie's stunted emotional handling of rejection, how he hasn't the capability to process this in a mature way, his power not helping matters.It just occurred to me: some may see parallels between ""Charlie X"" and the iconic Billy Mumy Twilight Zone tale ""It's a Good Life.""",8
16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Charlie X (TV Episode 1966)","A very good, and surprisingly poignant, early Trek","In this episode the standard monster-of-the-week plot line is tweaked with pathos and a fascinating guest character. Charles Evans grew up without exposure to other humans, and so he has no social skills, a desperate need to be liked, a sincere desire to do good, and a growing frustration about not succeeding among his own kind. But he also has godlike abilities imparted on him by the benevolent aliens who raised him. When his frustrations and neurosis boil over, he acts out, using his powers to hurt, until finally he becomes a vicious tyrant because, in his eyes, everybody around him deserves it. The Enterprise crew has a problem for which the only real solution is the sad ending Charlie inevitably arrives at.It's such a good episode because his character makes it work: he wants everything to work out well but he doesn't know how to do it. It's also good because it presents a realistic, sad resolution to the problem: Kirk and company want to help him, but like most of us they do not know the right way to address Charlie's problems. Nobody gets to be the hero and save the day: all anybody can do is helplessly watch as poor Charlie gets taken back by the aliens to the lonely, unhappy life he had before. Watch William Shatner carefully in the final moments of the episode: grieved for the kid he couldn't save. It's science fiction at it's most heart-tugging.The episode has one pretty jarring drawback: the scene where Uhura sings to Spock is awkward and difficult to sit through without feeling embarrassed for Nichelle Nichols; it could have been played better.",7

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. Unlike any other hit series, it only has 3 seasons so luckily it means that they will be covering up all their ideas within it until they are satisfied. As it often happens, the first season is always promising and has potential (or else it won't lift up for further more seasons) in it and is utilized with fine detailed work like focusing on different new breeds and characters bonding through this journey.A brilliant premise that is written explicitly on paper with fine details and gripping screenplay that is focused throughout the course of it and doesn't spend its time on petty emotional drama.

Did start a re watch once before, but so much was going on that still missed some and then had my TV series dvds and few movies (other items too) ""liberated"" by, well thought was a friend to whom I open my door to live in spare room with my daughter and I. Son was not happy with missing stuff as he was one of many who help buy for b days and Christmas, and couple series were his. OK over sharing, but when I buy, despite Netflix and such, I like the extras added to dvds/blurays, still only have part of my former collection, sadly Star Trek TOS, and TNG plus couple of the original movies have not replaced. Will say that TNG is my fav but TOS is next with the movies that follow the TOS series, the 4th movie is my top, though when watching, like to see all in order.Love the fact that for several of my fav real TV shows (HATE reality crap) that a 25/26 yr old playing 17 is the same as Buffy and Roswell. He played the part not to bad and really when thinking about it, the way the show was done, made sense. He was ""raised"" and not, by beings that gave him power to survive completely alone. Being completely isolated from any other human set the stage that when he was ""rescued"" still having power and never having interacted with another human, yes he was a child, still was though so close to being ""adult"" as hey if 16 and 17 yr old can serve a country and even tried as adult, there really was not much chance for him to really live among others his age or even other humans less they too had power. When he was begging to stay, you could feel for him, see that Kirk and the rest of the crew did too, and as the beings could not take the power away, well he would use them again no matter what he said as the power was completely part of him, a danger to everyone as he could not really stop being who he was.

0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Where No Man Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1966)",Kirk and Crew About to be Squashed Like Insects,"This was actually the 2nd Trek pilot filmed, after ""The Cage,"" and so is the first appearance of Capt. Kirk, not to mention Scotty and Sulu, here a physicist. There's no Dr. McCoy yet, instead a Dr. Piper. I would venture that in the scheme of things Trek, this episode takes place about a year before the earliest episodes of the series - note the slightly different uniforms. So this is Spock's second show; his character is still forming after the rough outline in ""The Cage,"" still raising his voice a bit too much for a Vulcan and almost smiling in one shot (during 3-level chess, also introduced). But then, the concept of Vulcan and even the Federation had not been created yet here - we're viewing the adventures of some Earth-based space fleet here, no more. The episode, like ""The Cage,"" has a bit of an epic feel for a TV show; it was designed to impress the NBC executives, who green-lit an actual series based on this, a miniature science fiction movie when all's said and done.Exploration is the highlighted theme, as it would be for the remainder of the series. Probing the unknown, Kirk directs the good ship Enterprise towards a mysterious galactic barrier, despite that what they know of this energy barrier makes it seem quite dangerous. Sure enough, the ship is damaged, 9 crew members are killed and 2 others, including old friend Gary, are mutated into superior beings. But, risk, as Kirk would say in a much later episode, is their business - that's what it's all about. Now begin the questions and search of another kind - how dangerous is such an ascendant man? Can he live with so-called normal human beings? The short answers, rather quick in coming, are 'very' and 'no' - Spock's the first one to voice this opinion. Only it doesn't transpire to be just an opinion. Rather than struggling with how to cope with his new powers, Gary shows that the old adage of absolute power corrupting absolutely is essentially a basic truth - it suggests all men have the need to dominate, to rule, buried somewhere inside, no matter how decent they seem. All it takes is a little power to bring it all to the surface.Heavy and deep concepts for a TV show, eh? It's rather impressive that all these ideas came forth in the middle of an action-oriented show. Roddenberry and his crew wanted to show the NBC execs that such an expensive-looking (for TV) sf show can be filmed in a timely manner, but they also stressed a lot of action scenes, especially in the climactic battle between Kirk and his former friend. Actor Fix played Piper the doctor as a standard crusty older member of the crew; Kelley showed what could be done with the doctor's role in the next filmed episode, ""The Corbomite Maneuver."" The two actors/doctors were later in the same film, ""Night of the Lepus""(72). The two main guest stars went on to stellar careers: Lockwood, who played Gary, soon appeared in ""2001:A Space Odyssey""(68) while Kellerman, as the other mutate, is famous for her role in ""M*A*S*H""(70).",8
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Where No Man Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1966)",One of the best,"""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" really set the tone for the ""Star Trek"" series more so than even Rodenberry's original pilot, ""The Cage"". In this story we have Kirk forced into making agonizing life and death decisions/his close relationship with Spock and that character's adherence to total logic at times being compromised by his own human side/the heroic crew all game to explore the vast uncharted regions of space- it's all there like a blueprint for numerous ""Star Trek"" scripts that followed.When Kirk's friend Gary Mitchell is endowed with astonishing powers of ESP and telekinesis, Kirk and Spock grow alarmed as he starts to test his ability to take over the Enterprise. Spock urges Kirk to maroon Mitchell on Delta Vega, an uninhabited planet. At first Kirk is outraged at even the suggestion, but eventually accepts the cold logic of this solution as Spock warns him, ""we'll never reach another earth base with him on board."" The scenes charting Mitchell's evolution are well acted by Gary Lockwood. His personality shifts startlingly back and forth between the affable crewman he was and the detached mutant he is becoming, and these glimpses of Mitchell's former self help us retain a measure of sympathy for him. He, too is a victim in this story. The silver contacts Lockwood wears are especially effective at making him appear as if his newly acquired powers have rendered him aglow from within. Plus, an echoing quality in his voice makes statements like ""You Should Have Killed Me When You Could, James"" sound especially frightening. One of the episode's best scenes occurs when Mitchell, severely weakened after trying to break through a force field, returns momentarily to his old self. A few seconds later however, the glow in his eyes re-ignites, but now it's even brighter than before. As he slowly rises to his feet, it looks this time like he will be able to pass right through the force field. But instead Mitchell stops and with a smile calmly informs them, ""I just keep getting...stronger. You know that, don't you?"" It's superbly intense and Alexander Courage's terrific music adds just the right note of dread to this scene.Of course Mitchell does eventually escape, taking the ship's psychiatrist, Dr. Daner, (played by Sally Kellerman) with him. She had also been affected by the mysterious force that has altered Mitchell and now they both have become mutants. Kirk bravely sets off on his own to track Mitchell down before his powers become so great no one can stop him. I gotta say, even after 40 years, all the elements of this one still work. From the threat imposed by Mitchell's ever increasing powers to the agonizing questions it poses about what to do with him, and finally the physical conflict between Kirk and Mitchell at the end. Oh, and also the moment Dr. Daner must choose a side; it ALL works so well. James Goldstone deserves particular praise for his sure handed direction and this is certainly right up there with his excellent work on the original ""Outer Limits"". I suppose ""Trek"" purists might criticize certain things like Mr. Sulu's then uncertain role on the ship and the moment where Spock actually smiles, but one must keep in mind this was only the second episode ever filmed, so the characters were still evolving. Anyways, such minor nitpicking's really don't detract from the obvious strengths of this superior entry in the series. I would place ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" among ""Star Trek's"" four best episodes. It's a smart and thoroughly entertaining example of television science fiction done right.",
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Where No Man Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1966)",The true beginning of the legend,"Although it was the third Star Trek episode that aired, Where No Man Has Gone Before (the title is taken from the final phrase spoken by William Shatner in the intro) is actually the pilot of Gene Roddenberry's sci-fi classic. Correction: it's the second pilot, since NBC rejected Roddenberry's original pitch, The Cage (it was too cerebral, apparently), but was still willing to give Trek the chance it deserved. The result is one of the show's best episodes, one that covers relevant themes like friendship, power and the misuse of the latter.Like most Star Trek episodes, it all begins as if it were just another day on the Enterprise. Then, out of the blue, the ship is hit by a magnetic storm. While assessing the material damage, Kirk and the crew make a horrifying discovery: two of the people on board, who have limited psionic abilities, are suddenly more powerful than ever, and soon that newfound power leads to insanity. At this point, Kirk must decide whether to kill them or not, before it's too late, and the choice is made even harder by the fact that one of the psychics is his best friend.Star Trek has been lauded for its frequent uses of a science-fiction context as tools to deal with more contemporary issues, such as war, genetic manipulations or racism. One of the most significant examples can be found here, with the story taking on religious connotations in the last section. This is not uncommon in the genre, which often relied on ancient myths and legends, which were updated in the futuristic setting. In fact, it's hard to watch Where No Man Has Gone Before and not think of Bellerophon, the man who got so blinded by his power he believed he was to be treated like a god, and was severely punished for his behavior. Of course, the friendship element means there's much more at stake, the script giving Shatner many opportunities to prove he isn't just a charismatic lead with peculiar speech patterns.Where No Man Has Gone Before isn't just a title, it's a statement. Gene Roddenberry wanted to do something new, something unprecedented, something that people would remember for years after it stopped airing. Boy, did he succeed.",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Where No Man Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1966)","""Star Trek"" at Its Best!","A lot of people rank ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" as their favourite ""Star Trek"" episode. While this is certainly a deserving episode (despite everything that was excised from author Harlan Ellison's original script), for my money, the distillation of Trek is the 2nd pilot episode, ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"".At no other time in the series do you see these characters, who became beloved sci-fi icons in just three short years, as raw & stripped down as in this episode. Yet it's not a traditional pilot by today's standards; there are no painful, mind-numbing ""origin"" scenes, no backstory explained, or need for either. It's as though the viewer has just signed aboard the Enterprise & is experiencing things from a cadet's perspective.Although the obvious friendship between Bill Shatner's somewhat fastidious ""Captain James 'R' Kirk"" (a gaffe that has haunted Trek writers for decades!) & Gary Lockwood's rather libidinous helmsman & longtime friend from Starfleet Academy, ""Gary Mitchell"", is what fuels this episode, it's the insight we're given into these characters that we would come to know so well that makes this the most fascinating of the show's original 79-episode run. Jim Kirk is obviously beleaguered by the fact that his dear friend is, through no fault of his own, mutating into Homo-Superior & dangerously toying with the ship & its crew. Mr Spock, ever the logical one, is so coldly logical in this outing that one has to wonder how Kirk ever warmed up to him. The anguish that Kirk feels when the realisation finally sinks in that he may have no other choice but to kill his old friend was only ever equalled -- & just barely at that -- by Shatner's performance in the aforementioned episode, ""City on the Edge of Forever"", when he must let his love, Edith Keeler, die right in front of him in order to put the Universe back to rights.Even the ""throwaway"" moments -- Lt Sulu as the ship's astrophysicist instead of helmsman, Dr Piper in lieu of Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy, future ""Room 222"" star Lloyd Haynes as the ship's communications officer, the warm knowing smile that Shatner gives to Jimmy Doohan's ""Scotty"" when told ""engineering, ready as always!"" -- give this episode a feeling of being well-worn. The crew know one another & work well together. The newbie on board, ""Dr Elizabeth Dehner"", played by the devastating beauty Sally Kellerman, shines through as she fights to have her new position validated by a crew that is already familiar & well-oiled.While Trek provided many entertaining moments, few have come close to this seminal version. The series' first pilot (initially rejected by NBC brass), ""The Cage"" tried a bit too hard to make you feel that this crew had a history. Original cast members Shatner, Nimoy, Doohan, & Takei give as excellent a performance in this pilot as they did in the rest of the series, & the ""ancillary"" Lockwood, Kellerman, Haynes, Pauls Carr & Fixx only enhance the mood.If you're looking to discover what Trek is all about, go no further than ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"".",10
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Where No Man Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1966)",A journey of the mind and its limitless power,"I'm agreeing with the reviewer that this episode was what really launched the Star Trek series toward cult status. Gary Lockwood who had done his time in outer space with 2001, A Space Odyssey plays one of two Enterprise crew members who are changed when the ship passes through a magnetic storm in space. The other crew member is Sally Kellerman who is assigned to the Enterprise as a psychologist who is changed and is able to understand the nature of the changes as Lockwood can't.Both have some latent Extra Sensory Perception powers and both are seeing that increasing exponentially. Lockwood is affected far more than Kellerman. Lockwood is truly a frightening person, one of the most frightening of Star Trek villains. He's been given absolute powers that are growing day by day. The Krels from Forbidden Planet could have served as a warning to him, his monsters from the ID are taking over completely.And as captain, William Shatner has to deal with this on the level of a threat to his ship and the whole galaxy and on the level of a friend of Lockwood's saddened to see the changes in him and the humanity that has been driven from his soul.A truly thought provoking episode, one of the best from Star Trek prime.",8
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Where No Man Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1966)",One of the Best Star Trek Episodes and Outstanding Science Fiction,"Some writers have often made a distinction between ""Sci-Fi"" and ""Science Fiction"". ""Sci-Fi"" is sometimes relegated to the more escapist aspects of the genre, such as ""Buck Rogers"", ""Flash Gordon"", and ""The Matrix"". Sure, good space fun, but Sci-Fi is not particularly interested in deep thematic storytelling as it is with pure entertainment via action and plot. ""Science Fiction"" on the other hand has an aspect of deeper and more complex thematic development. Masterpieces such as ""Dune"", ""A Canticle for Liebowitz"", ""The Left-Hand of Darkness"" or the ""Hyperion"" books by Dan Simmons demonstrate the cutting-edge literary potential of Science Fiction. ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"", the first Star Trek episode that became the jumping-off point for the rest of the original series run, is a monumental television episode that easily fits into the latter definition of ""Science Fiction"".The original Star Trek pilot, ""The Cage"", which was rejected by the networks, certainly has its moments (and achieved a resurrection in the superb episode ""The Menagerie""). However, ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" is a much more tightly written story, and the episode that green-lighted the series. Briefly, the story surrounds a star ship captain, James Kirk, who must make a terrible choice as one of his favorite crewmen, Gary Mitchell, experiences a strange transformation and begins to attain god-like abilities resulting from the ship having entered a strange energy field. Should the captain let him live or destroy him? The thematic writing of this episode is what makes the story a notch above other sci-fi offerings. What Captain Kirk must face in this episode is not black and white but a moral dilemma tinged with gray as we learn not only about Kirk and Mitchell's friendship but about their past. On one side of the argument is his first officer, Spock, who advises the execution of Mitchell. The other side is Dr Dehner, a young psychiatrist, who believes that Mitchell may not be evil. But Kirk is running out of time as his friend becomes stronger and stronger.The result is a truly satisfying tale that does not rely on cheap stunts or obvious ""good vs bad"". Is there action? Yes there is. Is there suspense? Absolutely. And yet, there is something a little deeper than just a western set in space, although Rodenberry, the creator, modeled much of Star Trek after the old serial and TV Westerns. There is even a ""gun fight"". This is Science Fiction at its best in which the story tells us something about the human condition through a tale of hyper-reality. That I think is what Science Fiction and Star Trek are all about when they are at their best, and why there is a difference between Sci-Fi and Science Fiction. Both have their place but Science Fiction has the potential to transcend itself and its readers.",10
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Where No Man Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1966)",Chunky Roll-Necks Ahoy!!,"I am re-visiting the first season of the original series a long time after my first viewings. I watched Man Trap and then Charlie X and everything was bumping along nicely. I was enjoying the gradual build of characters and sets... and then I watched this episode.I found >Where No Man Has Gone Before> far more fascinating from a historical ST developmental point of view, than I did for the story. In essence the story is workmanlike and solidly performed and does pick up some pace toward the end. But what keeps your eyes on the screen is the first incarnation of Spock, those chunky roll-neck sweaters that pass as uniforms and the marvellously wooden acting of some of the supporting players. (Check out the early scene where the Heads of Section arrive on the bridge - they come on in tight formation and remain that way for the next ten minutes...)..This is an essential episode for any true admirer of the ST universe - this is where it really kicked off!",
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Where No Man Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1966)",Solid kickoff,"Like any pilot of a beloved TV series, half the appeal is seeing the show in its nascent stages before all of the wrinkles are smoothed out. In the case of 'Where No Man Has Gone Before', a great deal is already in place: Kirk's in the chair, Sulu's on board, Spock has toned down his militaristic line delivery, but other cast members are still being arranged on the chess board, so to speak, and as familiar as everything is, it's still different.But not all that different. The Enterprise is still charting the outer reaches of space, and Kirk ends up taking the problem head-on in a brawl on another planet. There's the spirited action that this series is known for; but it's also a pretty good science fiction story, involving god-like beings, psychic powers, and the mighty fists of Shatner to ensure that everything is mixed just right. And it makes it a point to show that these people are out there in the void, at the mercy of an operable starship.'Where No Man' might not have the popping colors that we've come to expect on the Enterprise, but it's a great start nonetheless.8/10",8
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Where No Man Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1966)",2nd Pilot Hits a Home Run,"I've never been able to understand the mentality behind the NBC studio execs who chose to air this, the 2nd Star Trek pilot, as episode 3 in the regular series run (the continuity issues are painfully obvious, from the uniforms, to the differing gadgets, to Spock's eyebrows et al). No Man is really a mini movie. Gene Roddenberry compromised with the network after the initial pilot, The Cage, was rejected, combining the commentary about the human condition that he wanted with the action and adventure that the network execs demanded (which Roddenberry had promised them in the first pilot but didn't deliver), and the result was a vastly superior effort.Trek fans know the story well. The Enterprise is on a mission to leave the galaxy. When nearing the galaxy's edge, they encounter a disaster recorder from the SS Valiant from 200 years prior. After only getting bits and pieces of information from its badly burned tapes, Captain Kirk gives orders to go ahead. The ship encounters an energy barrier at the rim of the galaxy, which not only causes severe damage to the ship, but attacks several members of the crew. Nine of them are killed immediately, but two recover; Dr. Elizabeth Dehner (Sally Kellerman), a psychiatrist newly assigned to the Enterprise, and Lt. Commander Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood), Kirk's first officer and best friend. You see the change in Mitchell immediately in his eyes..which have become shiny and reflective. It turns out that every member of the ship who was attacked by the energy from the barrier rated high in ESP abilities..Mitchell's being the highest of all. Then Mitchell quickly develops super human powers, and it immediately becomes apparent to Spock that Mitchell is mutating into a vastly superior and dangerous being who could and would destroy the crew long before the ship could reach an earth base.Meanwhile, the only chance at repairing the Enterprise is Delta Vega, an automated planet nearby which has a ""lithium cracking station."" But the other purpose for going there is to get Mitchell off the ship by stranding him there (Spock advises Kirk that he either needs to maroon Mitchell or kill him while he still can). Using power packs on Delta Vega, Kirk and company are able to repair the ship, but Mitchell becomes so powerful he escapes from the security force field that is holding him. Then we see that Dr. Dehner's eyes now look like Mitchell's; it just took a little longer for her to start to mutate. Both of them take off, and Kirk sets out after them, catching up with Dr. Dehner and persuading her to help him stop Mitchell, while she still has a bit of humanity left in her.Star Trek had its share of tragic episodes, but this one nears the top. Kirk literally has to watch his best friend mutate into a monster. Kirk points out at the end that Mitchell didn't ask for what happened to him. You see what happens when a normal human being gets super powers (we also saw this in ""Charlie X"" among other episodes). Mitchell becomes so arrogant that he fancies himself as a ""god."" But as Kirk points out, a ""god"" still driven by human frailty. He accurately tells Dr. Dehner, ""There will only be one of you left in the end. One jealous god, if all this makes a god, or is it making him something else?"" This is not a pleasant episode, but once again, it's a fine exploration of the human condition and an excellent adventure. The networks gave Roddenberry a chance to get it right the 2nd time, and he did.",9

This feeling of absolute authority over the environment around Gary causes a corruption of his soul. We've seen this in dictators and politicians, that feeling of invincibility take over as they see themselves up above all others. We watch as Gary's world comes crashing down around him (literally) as he meets his demise. Man was not intended to have such power.When you first begin the episode and see the title of ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"", you assume Kirk and the gang are going into uncharted waters to explore new territory.

11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Where No Man Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1966)",The 'real' first episode of Kirk-era 'Star Trek',"Although this episode was broadcast third in the series it is in fact a second pilot episode and introduces us to Captain Kirk as well as to Scotty and Sulu; Spock is also present although he was of course introduced in the original pilot episode 'The Cage'. There are several characters who initially appear to being set up as major characters who are unfamiliar; some don't survive the episode and others just aren't seen again.While exploring the outer edges of the galaxy the Enterprise discovers the data recorder from a ship lost long ago. As Spock investigates its contents he discovers a strange warning about people with ESP. Dr. Elizabeth Dehner, the ship's psychiatrist assures Kirk that ESPers are of no danger and for the meantime the message is ignored. Heading out of the galaxy they enter a strange space barrier, it causes the death of a few crew members and has a strange effect of Kirk's old friend helmsman Gary Mitchell; he is knocked unconscious and when he awakens his eyes are shining in a peculiar way. It turns out he is an ESPer and it isn't long before his powers increase exponentially. Spock notes that as his powers increase he could become dangerous; he is soon looking down on ordinary people and it can't be long before he considers them mere irritants. Spock advises Kirk to abandon Mitchell on a remote planet before it is too late; it won't be easy though.This was a really good episode; it is just a shame it was broadcast out of order as established characters like McCoy and Uhuru aren't present and others who seem important are there is also the fact that the uniforms aren't the same as in the rest of the series; most notably Scotty and others who wear red are in beige. Just imagine; if things hadn't changed we'd be calling doomed one-episode characters 'beige shirts'! Guest star Gary Lockwood does a fine job portraying Mitchell as his megalomania increases along with his powers and Sally Kellerman is likable as Dr. Dehner. I also rather liked Andrea Dromm, who had a small part as Yeoman Smith thanks to Kirk addressing her as Yeoman Jones; it is a pity she never became a recurring character. Overall a great introduction to Kirk's era of 'Star Trek' with a good mix of drama, emotion and action.",8
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Where No Man Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1966)",Introducing Kirk and Company!,"ST:TOS:02 - ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" (Stardate: 1312.4) is the 2nd episode to go into production (if you count ""The Cage"" as episode 1, and this is the 2nd pilot - the one that was accepted) but the 3rd aired on TV. It is a fitting first for Captain Kirk and co. While ""The Cage"" is the first pilot of Star Trek, this episode introduces many of the characters we will come to love and know (Kirk, Scotty, Sulu, and a more logical/emotionless Spock than we saw in The Cage). Gary Lockwood (of 2001: A Space Odyssey fame) makes a great guest appearance as Kirk's longtime friend. The score by Alexander Courage is very fitting especially in the more terse moments because his music fits the action sequences quite well. This episode also shows William Shatner as the action-packed captain he will become known as. A very well done pilot - no wonder the NBC execs at the time decided to create a series based on this.",8
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Where No Man Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1966)",good start for classic series,"It's apparent while watching 'Where No Man Has Gone Before' that we are seeing a work in progress. This second pilot, and first season episode, shows a Star Trek still evolving- uniforms a little different, Spock's make-up and manner still harsh compared to later installments, and more importantly, the chemistry and balance between the characters still being worked on. But they're getting there. Roddenberry doesn't try to tell such a complicated story as he did with 'The Cage;' this one is a more straightforward, meat-and-potatoes sci-fi tale. And in a way, it's fitting that the first real 'Trek' takes them to the edge of the galaxy and through the 'great barrier' which affects two crew-members in particular, enhancing their already above-average capacity for extra-sensory perception. There are some genuinely creepy moments as Lt. Cmdr. Gary Mitchell morphs into a kind of super being, a 'god', who eventually loses all touch with his basic humanity and who unwittingly demonstrates absolute power corrupting absolutely. Leonard Nimoy was probably confused at how exactly to play Spock (""Ah, one of your Earth emotions,"" he says, smiling.) Spock here is pretty cold-blooded and brutal, urging Kirk to kill Mitchell while he still can, something that would be almost unthinkable with the character in later episodes. Kirk though is fully realized, the same character he would be throughout the series' run. So a very good start for 'Star Trek' proper, with most of the pieces in place... it just needed a little fine-tuning.",7
14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Where No Man Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1966)","Sadly, man has never gone back there","Oh Boy! A spaceship, a cool captain, a pointed-eared alien from Vulcan, what else could a kid ask for? I remember sneaking in late at night to watch and marvel at Star Trek on an old black-and-white TV set, and I loved every minute of it. Those were the days, I guy was not afraid to be a guy. Don't tread on me or will blast you to smithereens with phasers, photon torpedoes and the whole shebang! Today I can barely watch five minutes of Star Trek Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and all those boring, politically-correct undernourished Star Trek clones. Man, these neo-liberal characters like Picard, Sisko, Ryker, Crusher, etc, etc, etc, are as lifeless as the surface of the Moon; talk about cardboard characters, bloodless, gutless, sissy and unimaginative representatives of the homo sapiens species!OK, I agree the special effects are lame compared to today's standards (who cares?), I even agree that Shatner overacts sometimes (it is fun!). But no other Sci-Fi TV series had characters that are that likable and show such human warmth, camaraderie as Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Scotty. WNMHGB is one of my favorite ST episodes. It has travel beyond our Galaxy, mutants with god-like powers, very good acting and directing. And a wonderful story, too! A story where a man faces a super mutant and wins using raw power and neurons. And only a guy like Kirk could do something like that!Too bad these days are gone.",10
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Where No Man Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1966)",Going Boldly,"This episode was actually the second pilot to be filmed for the series, and opens with the Enterprise picking up a distress signal from a ship that's been missing for over two centuries. It turns out that the ship was destroyed and the call is actually coming from the emergency recorder (the cosmic equivalent of an airplane's black box) so Kirk orders it beamed aboard. When the probe starts transmitting a signal Kirk orders a Red Alert, if only for a dramatic development to take us into the opening credits. (Sometimes he orders a Red Alert when the galley runs out of tater tots.)Lt. Commander Gary Mitchell joins Kirk and Co. on the bridge, and he's played by none other than Gary Lockwood, who would go on to star in the astounding ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Next Sally Kellerman reports to the bridge as psychiatrist Elizabeth Dehner, and this beautiful actress would come to be known for her role on M*A*S*H and for her sultry, seething voice, a voice which had the power to melt men, women and steel. Spock discovers that the missing ship- Valiant- was researching ESP before self-destructing, and the next sequence is one of the best in the series.Kirk orders the Enterprise out of the galaxy at warp one, and the ship immediately comes up against a mysterious force field that does not appear on their sensors. The visual effects on the field are spectacular- a flowing, pulsing purple horizon that would stand up with any CGI today or of the future. Its subtlety is masterful: this was the age when special effects were used to serve the story's needs. Unfortunately that has come to be completely reversed. Black space is visible above and below the event horizon in the exterior shot, and the Enterprise in relation for once seems perfectly scaled. These effects- ironically- bear a slight resemblance to those that would later be used in ""2001.""It's a fitting comparison because this scene is cinematic in nature- both dramatically and from a technical standpoint. Lt. Mitchell and adorable Crewman Smith wordlessly take one another's hands during the crisis, and no comment is ever made about this intimate exchange. The field begins to storm, change color, and there are actual explosions aboard the ship- control panels sparking, smoking and flaming. Finally, Mitchell and Dehner are zapped by an unknown force, and Gary is left with silver glowing eyeballs.The Enterprise is left paralyzed, warp engines down, and Lt. Mitchell begins to show symptoms of being a Supergenius: he's reading several books an hour and controlling his medical monitors telepathically. He quotes a sonnet written ""back in 1996"" and it's little script touches such as this that make the show a joy. Dr. Dehner conceals Gary's abilities from her superiors and has an emotional outburst during a departmental briefing: an objective scientist she is not. Spock suggests killing Lt. Mitchell, reasoning that a similar, unchecked situation led to the destruction of the Valiant. It's a great plot point and Kirk is faced with an excellent moral dilemma: sentence his own friend to die or risk the life of his ship and crew.I find the development of Gary's character during his ""mutation"" to be extraordinarily realistic: he's not a cackling, power-mad villain, but he's clearly transcended the bounds of humanity. He openly agrees with Spock's conclusion: he admits he's a threat but he can't stop the progression. The Enterprise arrives at Delta Vega for repairs and to strand Gary, but he soon overpowers them and takes the psexy psychiatrist to be his omnipotent Eve in his self-styled Eden.But, just like in the Bible, paradise is interrupted by a Starship Captain with a sub-machine gun. Kirk, Dehner & Gary battle over the line between God and man, the theme at the heart of the episode, and the writers weave it in to the action beautifully: no heavy-handed speeches or static pontificating. ""Morals are for men, not gods,"" proclaims Mitchell, and he has clearly lost his humanity, and all compassion, attacking Kirk with bolts of lightning from his fingertips. Dehner, still merciful, intervenes, buying the Captain enough time to bury Gary the god in the grave marked for James T. Kirk. Fantastic.Back on board the ship Spock confesses to having ""felt"" for Gary- ouch- and then Smiles at Kirk's comment- yikes: very out of character for the Vulcan. Let's chalk this last bit up to the fact that this episode was just the second pilot filmed for the series, and the stoic, analytical Spock character that we all know and love had yet to be perfected.It would be illogical to do otherwise.GRADE: A+",
16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Where No Man Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1966)",Innovative Exterior Shots destroyed with lame CGI,"The thing I remember of this 2nd Pilot episode was the fantastic shot of the Enterprise entering the ""Barrier"" at the galaxy's rim and the way it appeared while being tossed around like a rag doll. I was nine years old when I first saw this, it left an impression.I have just watched a version of this pilot, with all of those incredible graphics TOTALLY REMOVED and replaced with the worst CGI I have ever seen.This is a debacle as bad as George Lucas ruining his original Star Wars trilogy by inserting all kinds of busy CGI garbage. And now for the second time, I have to say NO! Leave it as it was originally done!To replace an eleven foot model of the USS Enterprise with a badly rendered CGI dupe, was wholly ineffective. The ironic thing is that Digital Modeling has gotten much better and even in 2005, the USS Enterprise D was duplicated digitally for the series finale of ""Enterprise"" - THAT, at least, was realistically done. The graphics for this enhanced Blu Ray set, a child could have done, and it was no way as effective as the original photographic plate.I'm glad the producers of the set gave the viewers the opportunity to choose which version they are to watch, Original or Ruined.As far as this episode was originally made? It broke all barriers of Network Television, creating a new standard of production to beat, always being challenged by lesser shows like ""Lost in Space"" or ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea."" Ironically, the budgets for this show were so low that it is amazing that they were able to pull off the quality of production that they ended up with.To make us BELIEVE we were in a starship, traveling among the stars, visiting all those planets, meeting Vulcans, Andorians. Klingons, Romulans.... No other show had as big an impact as this one small show from the 60'sIn this episode, crewman Gary Mitchell, Kirks colleague and friend, is touched by some force that rapidly changes him into something with Godlike Powers. This was portrayed rather simplistically but effectively, basically bringing to mind the adage about ""Absolute Power"" and it's properties of corruption.It is the choice of what to do with that power: One person wants to use it for manipulation, the other with compassion.It is not that people will not make mistakes when given an allotment of authority: It is, what they will do with it at the end of the day: When all of the chips are down, what kind of person are you?",10
17,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Where No Man Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1966)",Man vs. Man,"I don't think there's much to add here but just grant me a few remarks. To me (and I guess I'm hardly the only one) nearly every Star Trek Episode has its point beyond what is shown on screen. So this is the one that started it all (at least officially). Star Trek is always about mankind, the ""human equation"" one might say. For that it seems quite reasonable to establish that kind of equation in the first episodes and that is what is taking place in ""Where no Man has gone before"". By trying to pass the galactic barrier Captain Kirk is confronted with a situation that challenges him personally as well as professionally. His friend Gary Mitchell has turned into some kind of super human with God-like abilities. So Kirk gets caught between his command of the ship and his compassion for his friend who must be marooned on Delta Vega to save the ship threatened by him. Kirk taking his responsibility for his ship defeats Mitchell in a fight and finally saves his crew.Not much to it one might say. But lets take a closer look. Is it really just Kirk who fights Mitchell in the final scene? Or is he stepping out of his character, representing mankind itself in a desperate struggle against its worst enemies: megalomania, selfishness, arrogance, immorality (which all can be interpreted as facets of ""Evil"")? Mitchell suddenly able to reach way beyond human possibilities stands for the power corrupted megalomaniac. He has the powers of a God but has to deal with them in a human way. He is not able to cope with the situation and gets mad for it is not (or should I say not yet) possible for man to take that many steps in evolution at once (if at all). Kirk stands on the other side. He realizes that there is no way to convince Mitchell to cooperate and decides to fight him. Kirks point is to stress that the human strengths don't lie in his physical or mental powers (an increase of Power will always lead to corruption and injustice) but in reason and moral duty. The best line of this episode delivered by Mitchell makes it clear: ""Command and compassion, that's a fool's mixture."" Mitchell gets it but misses the point. That's what Kirk and the Federation or Starfleet stand for in their early days. Technically highly developed but morally as well to keep the balance. They aren't pacifists, they know when to fight (also an element of reason and duty) but they don't enjoy it. The ongoing struggle in Star Trek is that of man against himself, in this case represented by Kirk and his good friend Mitchell. That's the point and even if there will be a lot of alien races and unknown phenomena in shows to come there's always a human facet to it...A strong point for an all time classic episode starting off an all time classic SF series.",8

While in the episode ""The Mantrap"",(season 1 episode 1), McCoy is the ship's Physician, And Spock is quite a bit less emotional and a star date of 1521, I think they were released out of order, also the ships viewing screens are reversed, the later show has the earlier screen and the earlier show has the later screen but otherwise great shows.",9

I read in ""Star Trek Compendium"" that in the 1966 World Science Fiction Convention, the audience asked ""This is for TV?!"". The only bad thing is the stupidity of NBC. Roddenberry made this for FIRST episode on purpose.

A major reduction in the budget was ordered and big changes to the cast which would shape the series. William Shatner stepped into the role of Enterprise captain James T. Kirk and would forever be associated with the role. We see George Takei as Sulu, albeit in a different role onboard the Enterprise. In addition, Leonard Nimoy plays Spock in the manner in which the fans would grow accustomed. James Doohan plays chief engineer Scotty but the other regular cast members would follow later on. The story in ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" is a lot more exciting and entertaining than that of ""The Cage."" The plot rushes by and that is always a good sign. Two members of the crew are imbued with telepathic powers which makes them particularly dangerous to the safety of their colleagues. One of them is an old friend of Kirk's from Starfleet Academy (Gary Lockwood) but friendship is soon a thing of the past as Kirk finds he needs to use extreme measures in order to protect his ship and the lives of the crew. This was actually the first time viewers got to see an episode of ""Star Trek"" in 1965. In all the episodes I have seen, I have seldom seen Kirk endure such a beating like the one he suffers in this episode. His vulnerability becomes quite obvious as he struggles to gain the advantage against his adversary. The television crew and cast had to work 100 hours a week in order to get this second pilot episode made but it was certainly worth it. The results were far more successful this time around and a series was soon commissioned. Television history was about to made.",10

As a little kid I was freaked out by the scary silver eyes, but also I didn't like the unfamiliar uniforms and the unfamiliar faces or the way Kirk and Spock barely seem to know each other.Today all the weak points seem like strong points to me. This is the one episode where Kirk and Spock actually relate like an earth man and an alien, with a wary distrust that gradually changes to grudging respect. I could do without Nimoy's SHOUTING his dialogue, though. ""FULL power!""The fact that the villain is an old friend of Kirk's makes it a lot more powerful, though they repeated this trope a little too often in later episodes. But Gary Lockwood really has a very Kirk like quality, and that strengthens the story as well as adding some unintentional humor. (""I'm not JOKING, Lee!"")But the best thing about this episode by far is Sally Kellerman, at the very height of her beauty, playing a woman who has dignity, integrity, compassion, and empathy -- and who falls head over heels for a man destined to destroy her. It's silly science fiction stuff, but when she cries out ""a mutated man could also be a *WONDERFUL* thing"" you are seeing right into her heart and soul, seeing how she's fallen and she doesn't even know it.Oh, and don't forget pretty little Yeoman Smith -- I mean Jones!

Gary Mitchell and Dr. Elizabeth Dehner. It seems Mitchell gained psionic powers quickly followed by Dr. Dehner. Mitchell is calling himself ""a God"" and has a much different personality and he's causing a lot of problems on the USS Enterprise.This 3rd episode of season one is the second pilot episode of Star Trek, the first pilot being ""The Cage"". This particular episode, Where No Man Has Gone Before, really does look and feel like it kicked off the TV series - yet it was ""The Man Trap"" that aired first.7.5/10",7
24,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Where No Man Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1966)","Okay episode, but doesn't hold up that strongly","I first saw this episode many years ago, when I was quite young, and thought it was very impressive. Now that I'm older, though, it just doesn't hold up that well.The episode does have some positive elements: lots of action; some dynamic performances, especially by Shatner; a welcome guest appearance by a young Sally Kellerman; and a premise that, at least on the surface, seemed interesting-- the moral dilemma involved if a close personal friend becomes a mortal threat.However, the flaws are also great. One thing I didn't like is that the Gary Mitchell character, played by Gary Lockwood, got corrupted far too quickly and easily. I mean, this guy was supposed to have been a top level Starfleet officer, and a close personal friend of Kirk, yet he goes mad with power right away. Almost from the outset, he even boasts about crushing them like insects and says that the smart thing to do would be to kill him. I thought people in the future, especially Starfleet officers, were supposed to have better characters than that. The story would have been much more interesting and compelling if Mitchell had been portrayed as fighting against the urge to turn evil, which would at least have made him sympathetic, but he doesn't, not even for a second.This behavior is implausible to me for several reasons. While I could see absolute power corrupting eventually, why does it happen so fast? It's almost like Mitchell was driven kind of loony tunes by whatever changed him (yet, that didn't happen to Dehner, so that argument is weakened). More importantly, all he really had to do was to conceal or minimize his powers until they were so great that no one could stop him; why act like a grandiose monster and warn everyone right away that he was a mortal threat? Kirk was kind of an idiot for not heeding Spock's warnings after Mitchell himself declared that Spock was right. He was supposed to be hyper-intelligent (called Spinoza ""childish""; absorbed the ship's library in hours), yet his behavior is pretty stupid and self-destructive.Also, Dr. Dehner (Kellerman) did not turn into evil incarnate right away like he did. This suggests that Mitchell really was, fundamentally, a corrupt and evil person at the core. I disliked the fact that Kirk gives both Mitchell and Dehner the same commendation at the end; she richly deserved it, but Mitchell didn't deserve it at all. She was the real hero of the piece.Some great dialogue, though, that still impresses me. Kirk in desperation, trying to sway Dehner- ""What's your prognosis, doctor?!"" Spock-- ""All I know is logic. In my opinion, we'll be lucky to repair the ship and get away in time."" Of course, he was right. Indeed, the way Mitchell's power was continuously increasing, he could probably soon fly through space on his own power and destroy whole worlds.I also have a quibble about the corny sci fi here. Not even a feeble attempt was made to explain the incredibly ridiculous physics here-- what the heck was Mitchell's power source?? Why did he have no limits at all? No one ever had a fighting chance against this guy, ever, unless they killed him early enough.The two characters who come across best here are Dehner and Spock. This was an early episode, so I haven't rated it too harshly, and it does have some enjoyable elements; but it is very difficult to see the Mitchell character as anything other than pure evil.",6
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Naked Time (TV Episode 1966)",No Beach to Walk on... as The Ship Spirals Down,"Here, we learn that Kirk yearns to walk on a beach somewhere, perhaps with Yeoman Rand. This episode is probably best known as the one with Sulu, stripped to the waist, running around the ship's corridors with a sword. But, it's this episode where we learn a lot of interesting things about the main characters, so all the actors get a chance to shine a bit, including Hyde as young crewman Riley in the first of his two appearances on the show. Hyde provides most of the amusing scenes in this episode, but it's not really a comedy, such as ""I,Mudd"" or a ""A Piece of the Action."" It's a grimly amusing tone as Hyde manages to take over the engine room and the ship then starts to spiral downward towards the planet the Enterprise is orbiting, it seems to certain doom. What Kirk really needed to refine after this episode is ship's security; not only do they ignore Spock's request to escort Riley to sickbay, they then let him take over the ship - all by his lonesome!Besides Riley, a nutty Irishman at heart, Sulu reveals his secret taste for swashbuckling, nurse Chapel turns out to be secretly in love with Spock, who shows a tendency to weep uncontrollably over his lot in life (half-Vulcan, half human) and, finally, Kirk seems caught between his love of the Enterprise and more normal desires. I was puzzled as to why Uhura wasn't affected by this strange space disease (altered water, it turned out), since she had prolonged contact with the sweaty Sulu (that's how the disease spreads). The disease forces all the hidden desires and emotions of the affected crew to the surface. It's a far better depiction of released inhibitions than the later retread on TNG - ""The Naked Now,"" where everything was very one-note by comparison.The episode is brilliantly paced and directed. It begins rather slowly and uneventfully, not quite routine since they find a scientific party which is dead by mysterious circumstances. There's an ominous tone to this first act, but it gives no hint of the wild madness to come. Things escalate rapidly to a delirious pitch, with Kirk near panic as he loses all control of the ship and then himself. There are some great stylistic flourishes during the final act, such as a fevered Kirk's entry into one of the lifts, where he sees the words written in red paint - it's almost surreal. And, of course, his confrontation with Spock and their mutual slapping scene is one of the all time classics. You never look at any of these characters in quite the same way after this episode.",9
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Naked Time (TV Episode 1966)",Naked...and Essential,"The Enterprise is assigned to pick a scientific team of a planet which is soon going to die - only to find the team dead - in very mysterious and bizarre circumstances. Thus begins one of THE most essential Trek episodes of all. When the team of Spock and young Joe Tromolen returns to the ship, Tromolen begins acting in a remorseful and then suicidally way - stabbing himself out of regret for 'polluting space' - infecting Sulu and navigator Kevin Riley in the process - beginning the fast spread of madness throughout the ship.Very cleverly, Roddenberry and company use the disease to display the inner thoughts and desires of some of the characters, even as the ship spins closer to death.This is beautifully acted, and expertly directed by veteran TV director Marc Daniels. Some of the highlights:The scene in the briefing room with Spock slowly losing his emotional control is perhaps one of the best Trek scenes ever. It is done in one take, with a slow dolly shot that subtly closes in on Spock's breakdown. THIS is the scene which made Spock as a character -with a few slips, Nimoy never looked back as far as overplaying Spock.The incredulous look Scott gives Kirk when he finds out that the engines have been totally shut down -""It'll take thirty minutes just to regenerate them!"" basically sets the Scotty character mold also - right through the ""I canna change the laws of physics!"" line. From the point where Kirk finds Spock in the briefing room (""My mother..I never told her I love her!"") through Kirk's infection, and HIS lamentations about a captain's relationship with 'his' ship, all the way through the risky engine implosion and subsequent time warp, are as dramatic and exciting science fiction ever done. The key line here is Kirk, gathering his strength to return to the bridge, wistfully looking up at his love (The Enterprise), and whispering to himself, ""Never lose you...never"" I have literally seen this more times than I count, but it STILL gets to me, as THIS is Kirk laid bare - and it stays part of his character for the rest of the shows AND movies.And of all the goofs - anyone notice Spock NEVER gets 'the cure'?",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Naked Time (TV Episode 1966)","Fears, desires and swords","The Naked Time is one of the more entertaining Star Trek episodes, even though there is the usual percentage of danger involved. It's also one of those stories that uses its central plot device (in this case a virus) as a means to explore the essence of the show's characters, which is always welcome, given the series' general lack of long-term psychological development.The aforementioned virus is brought on board after the exploration of a planet where everyone was killed without a logical explanation. Soon enough, though, it becomes apparent that the cause of death has reached the Enterprise: the disease removes the infected person's inhibitions, unveiling his or her most hidden desires. Because of this, Sulu starts running around shirtless with a sword in his hand, Spock discovers a female crew member is in love with him (it also turns out he isn't as cold and rational as he likes to make us believe, thanks to his human half) and Kirk is torn between his duties as captain and wishes of a more personal nature. Someone must come up with a solution fast, or this kind of behavior could mean the end of the Enterprise.The Naked Time is essentially a 45-minute extravaganza where we get to see how Kirk and the others would behave if they lost their common sense and reverted to the animal side of their nature. The story is rather thin (it's basically a succession of entertaining skits), but the performances make it worth watching, especially Nimoy's work, which apparently was so well received by fans that the writers decided to play on Spock's dual nature as often as they could. A very wise decision indeed.",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Naked Time (TV Episode 1966)",Should Be The 3rd Episode For New Viewers To Watch,"I'm showing a friend of mine Star Trek for the first time, he's not from America and younger so is totally unfamiliar with the show. The first episode I showed was Where No Man Has Gone Before, since it was the pilot for how the show would mostly be cast. The second episode was The Man Trap, since that introduces Dr McCoy, an essential part of the Star Trek triangle of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. This was the third episode I showed him thinking it would show the rest of the crew well, and it does. But then I was really shocked to see how awesome this episode was with the Mr Spock emotional scene! I have not watched this show for over a decade so my memory is weak, this is a great episode. The ship crashing into the whirling planet works really good. Overall one could make a case for this being a high 7 or 8 IMDb episode but I'm giving it a 10 because it's essential Star Trek in that there are two major plot points used throughout the franchises going forward and they are both here first. The Vulcan neck pinch and time travel. The time travel part I had completely forgotten about but there it is almost as a tease. Little does my first time viewing friend know how important that is to this show. Must see Star Trek, I recommend it as the 3rd episode to watch for any first time viewer or those revisiting the show like me! If I were to recommend a 4th episode next it would be Dagger Of The Mind since that further explores Spock's Vulcan capabilities and is important to the franchise (although in actuality we watched The Enemy Within and that's a good 4th or 5th episode as well). BTW, Eddie Paskey, the red shirt minor character who was in more Star Trek episodes then Sulu or Chekov has a pretty decent bit part on the bridge taking over for Sulu. it's fun to notice him in episodes! Not his first one but pretty prominent. 10 of 10, essential Star Trek episode.",10
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Naked Time (TV Episode 1966)",Id Impulses,"A nicely done episode that is based on a virus that is brought on board the ship by an away team. They have been on a planet where several people have died due to mysterious circumstances. It is transferred through simple touch. This virus has as its symptoms, the display of irrational behavior, founded in the inner mind of the crew members. Each crew member begins to show emotions held deep inside them. This is a theme that will be used many times. We also are exposed to the foundational makeup of each of the major crew members. Spock, for one, shows emotion (remember that the Vulcans were once an emotional people who repressed it to become more efficient and calculating). This is the first episode where the crew members begin to actually interact. Relationships are forged. It is the first episode where a crew member must fly in the face of an epidemic, a threat from within. Many are to follow. The acting is better and the story is creative and challenging. Fear is the issue here.",8
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Naked Time (TV Episode 1966)","""It's like nothing we've dealt with before"".","Pretty safe to say, as this was only the fourth episode of the series, and not a whole lot had been dealt with unless you consider the epic struggle against a near god-like crew member in the prior episode (Where No Man Has Gone Before). What's fun for me is picking out all the 'firsts' in the series while watching them in order of release. This story offers Spock's first use of the unnamed Vulcan nerve grip, and the first reference to Dr. McCoy's nickname Bones. There's also the heartbeat pulse during a particularly harrowing sequence.And ah yes, there's the 'space madness', a cunning device used to allow the crew members to drop their guard and give form to their usual inhibitions. It turns out Spock has yet another admirer amid the crew, Nurse Chapel; in the prior stories Uhura carried on an infatuation with the Vulcan science officer. The way it affects Spock himself is also intriguing, he has all he can do to exert control over his emotions. Yet Kirk draws him out with the slapping contest; did you notice that Kirk was bleeding on the wrong side of his mouth after Spock decked him with the backhand to the left side of his face? Blood was trickling from the right corner of his lips.No touchy feely stuff was going to save the Enterprise from THIS space madness. Scotty can't change the laws of physics and the ship spirals out of control into the orbit of Psi-2000. Captain Kirk has to make that one in ten thousand choice to save the crew, just as he would so many times throughout the series run. I guess that's why I enjoy the show so much, that determined willingness to make a decision and stick with it in the face of danger and chaos. That, and the way the writers made stuff up along the way, like Alert Condition Baker Two, and raising the antimatter temperature eight hundred forty degrees. All the while trying to answer the question posed by crewman Tormolen - ""What are we doing out here in space""?",7
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Naked Time (TV Episode 1966)","Maybe not the most intellectual episode ever, but it sure was fun","Okay, the basic plot of the show was awfully simple and the episode lacked depth, but on the other hand, it was a lot of fun to watch and this make it among the better episodes. The enterprise encounter a strange space plague that is brought on board by a really stupid crew member. The crewman's decision to take off his protective gear when they encountered the virus was, in hindsight, not a brilliant move to say the least!! He thereby became the vector that brought this virus aboard and it soon spread like wild fire. The disease acted a lot like LSD and made people do dangerous and psychotic things--and this was pretty entertaining!! Seeing Sulu thinking he was one of the Musketeers was hilarious, but I particularly liked when Lt. Rilley took over the control room and tried to smash the ship into the planet--all the while singing the same annoying Irish tune again and again and again!!! This tongue-in-cheek style is the reason I really loved the episode as well as the way that it allowed so many of the crew to express and explore themselves. Not the very best episode, but definitely among the better ones of the series.",9

Speaking of Spock, he even gets to lose his unflappable composure as emotion smothers self control. Also, check out the wicked pimp hand on our favorite Vulcan; shortest slap fight in history.Overall, this is a great one. Starts out lighthearted, but as Enterprise's orbit continues to decay, there's action, suspense and a real sense of danger. Lots of shouting, too.

Spock's struggle with emotion, Kirk's conflict between finding romantic love and maintaining Captain-like control, Sulu's... fencing hobby?

The away team finds the base staff dead; all in bizarre situations; one man was found frozen to death while showering fully dressed and others were just seated at their posts. One of the away team comes into contact with a red liquid and soon starts acting strangely, questioning why men are in space. Back on board the Enterprise his condition worsens and he threatens Sulu and another crewman with a knife. They disarm him but are soon acting strangely themselves; Sulu is running around with a sword and the other man starts singing Irish ballads and more dangerously locks himself in engineering and takes control of the ship. This would be bad at the best of times but the Enterprise is in a decaying orbit and more and more crew members are becoming affected. It is a race against time as Scotty tries to force his way back into Engineering and McCoy works to find a cure for the strange condition.This is an entertaining episode which grabs the viewer's attention quickly; the opening scenes where the frozen base is explored and crewman Tormolen is contaminated make clear that something strange has happened and will inevitably start happening again on the Enterprise without making it too obvious what might happen. As more and more people become infected it becomes apparent that the condition affects people emotionally in a way similar to alcohol without the accompanying drunkenness it removes people's inhibitions so some, like Tormolen, will become maudlin, others will become flirtatious and others will act out fantasies. This is done in an interesting way and even though we know it will work out in the end it is quite tense as they race against time regain the ship and struggle to deal with the condition. The effects of the condition give us a chance to see the main cast acting in a way we don't usually; it was particularly fun seeing Sulu running around the ship with a sword, William Shatner hamming it up as Kirk gets overly emotional and Spock actually showing some emotion.I wasn't surprised to learn that this was intended to be a two part episode as the solution to one problem leaves the Enterprise travelling back in time only for this problem to be solved almost immediately so quickly that there was little point having it happen at all! Overall a pretty good episode that I really enjoyed.",8
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Naked Time (TV Episode 1966)",Pretty good episode,"I thought this was the first fairly good episode of the first season (not including ""The Cage"", which I did like; I'm going by the Blu Ray set, which had episodes 1-3 as ""Man Trap"", ""Charlie X"", and ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"", and this one as the 4th episode). Sure, there was some hammy acting (by Shatner and Nimoy in particular), but the premise was interesting (crew becoming disinhibited, revealing their hidden secrets) and the techno-crisis was also interesting. The silly acting actually kind of added to the fun of it. I've seen this episode many times before, and it holds up quite well on re-watch.The crew did almost everything right here-- decontaminated everyone and medically checked them; Spock ordered security to make sure Riley made it to sickbay-- and they didn't do it! I know it was a necessary part of the plot for Riley to seal off engineering, but confining Riley would have eliminated the crisis! I thought that the only really implausible part was that Riley could disable the entire ship so easily; surely they would have command codes and security access features to prevent a relatively low ranking officer from doing something like that. But that's a minor quibble that easily could have been taken care of with minor script changes, so I don't mind too much.Great character moments here- Kirk as obsessed with the ship; Spock forced to suppress his emotions all his life; Chapel's love of Spock (was Majel Barrett with Roddenberry already by this point?). Sulu's swashbuckling was dorky, but at least Takei actually got to do something in that episode rather than just sit around-- Shatner really did hog most of the screen time! I actually thought this episode was significantly better than the analogous TNG episode, ""The Naked Now""-- there, Picard makes numerous dumb decisions that greatly facilitate the spread of the contagion. Here, Kirk and Spock made only small, fairly excusable errors. Though on the whole, I find the writing much superior on TNG. But TOS had pretty good writing for a 1960's show.The time travel shtick was goofy, but it did open up many possibilities.",7
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Naked Time (TV Episode 1966)","the purpose of a briefing, gentlemen..","Star TrekThe Naked TimeA cultural hub and by far one of the most loved and respected tale, Star Trek is created by Gene Roddenberry who wrote this brilliant concept, ahead of its time and is probably why it still doesn't fail to entertain us after these many years. It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. Unlike any other hit series, it only has 3 seasons so luckily it means that they will be covering up all their ideas within it until they are satisfied. As it often happens, the first season is always promising and has potential (or else it won't lift up for further more seasons) in it and is utilized with fine detailed work like focusing on different new breeds and characters bonding through this journey.This was certainly different and more exhilarating than others for it doesn't have a particular culprit in the ship and it draws out unseen emotions from unexpected characters and projects some of the best drama on screen; the encounter between Spock and Kirk after they have been infected is brilliant.",
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Enemy Within (TV Episode 1966)","The Most Brutal, Thoughtless Captain Kirk","The title itself is misleading in this episode and so are the first few scenes. The second Kirk who materializes on the transporter platform after a strange malfunction is not a duplicate of the real Capt. Kirk, nor is he, as it turns out, an enemy to Kirk's existence. Kirk himself gets it wrong as he describes what happened in his log. Neither of the Kirks after the credits is the real one in this episode. They are both half of the real Kirk, who no longer exists at this point. The meek, mild half is more difficult to notice as not being quite real while his confidence slips away more gradually. The violent, animalistic half gives himself away more easily as he demands Saurian brandy from Dr. McCoy and then tries to rape Yeoman Rand. Yes, the crew who encounter him still believe it's Capt. Kirk, but it's as if he's taken some bad drugs lately - not very captainly behavior.Shatner gets to tap into his inner rage with his performance as the so-called evil Kirk version in this episode. This version of Kirk is always sweating, eyes furtive, and then usually spasming into a screaming fit as if totally out of control or seriously ill. It's a startling transition whenever we switch from the calm, tired Kirk (also ill, tho in a benign fashion) to this obvious madman (the lighting in these scenes also helps). However, by the 3rd act, we learn, via Spocks's analytical observations, that all of Kirk's power of command rests in this evil half. Of course, the entire episode debunks the whole simplistic concept of good and evil; the supposed negative side of Kirk is needed for him to function as captain. We humans are made up of many parts, this story says, and all of these are necessary, whether labeled positive or negative (one can say the same for business and political leaders).This episode has some pretty intense moments, especially the scene of the negative Kirk attacking Rand - it's a bit too real and is uncomfortable to watch, a disturbing depiction of attempted rape. I'm not sure what to make of Spock's snide remark to her at the end - maybe his intent was to diffuse the whole thing, but it seemed quite inappropriate - though she just took it in stride. The glaring flaw in the episode, in retrospect, is that no shuttlecrafts were sent to rescue the men trapped on the planet below from freezing to death. Maybe the crafts were all in disrepair or there was something in the atmosphere (or maybe they weren't written into the show, yet). Of course, this added dilemma of crew members slowly dying served to underscore the positive Kirk's growing indecision on such matters. It was probably in this episode that we first learned how infallible a starship captain must be, even if just for the sake of appearance.",8
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Enemy Within (TV Episode 1966)",William Shatners finest Kirk,"I give this episode 9 stars for being excellent overall! It is one star short for one glaring problem, it never explains why the crew didn't send a shuttle craft to pick up Sulu and the landing party! The real reason of course is probably because the Shuttlecraft as a prop had not been created yet! However, this is Star Trek's take on the Jeckyll and Hyde concept and I think it was brilliantly handled by all concerned. William Shatner as the more mild version of Kirk, or the weaker half, excels, while his stronger half, or more aggressive side has to be subdued! The script does this in a way that we can relate to on a personal level. The makers of the Superman series would do the same thing to the man of Steel in Superman three, and although Christopher Reeve's performance is also a tour DE force, the final solution of the ""Good"" Superman chocking his ""Evil"" half, is not as well realized as it would be in this Star Trek episode, the side that was more passive would not have choked anyone or done harm to anything. So Star Trek, in my view, dealt with this story line in a more believable manner.",9
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Enemy Within (TV Episode 1966)",Double the Kirk; Double the trouble!,"While exploring an alien world a crewman is slightly injured and beams back to the Enterprise, the transport takes a little longer than usual; possible because of the alien mineral on his clothing. Captain Kirk is the next to beam up and he is a little unsteady as he steps off the transporter pad. Scotty accompanies him as he leave the room and moments later the transporter activates again a second Kirk, this one wild-eyed, has materialised. This one heads to sickbay and demands McCoy gives him a bottle of brandy, he then heads to Yeoman Rand's quarters and tries to force himself on her! Soon afterwards Scotty reports that a creature that was beamed up to the planet has been duplicated; first a docile one appeared then a snarling one it doesn't take them long to realise that the same has happened to Kirk. At first it is believed that the second is an evil duplicate but later becomes apparent that they are two parts of the whole and without his darker side Kirk has lost the decisiveness that makes him suitable for leadership; the evil Kirk must be captured alive if they are to find a way to recombine the two halves of his personality. If that wasn't enough the temperature on the planet is dropping and with no way to beam the away team back it is feared they will freeze to death.This was pretty solid episode with an interesting story; so interesting that various other 'Evil Kirks' appear in later episodes. Having the two Kirks gave William Shatner the opportunity to really ham it up as the evil version but also to give a more subtle performance is the good, more introvert, Kirk. The level of Evil Kirk's unpleasantness was quite surprising; I expected him to be a bit of a megalomaniac and even violent but his attack on Grace Lee Whitney's Yeoman Rand came as quite a shock. The secondary story concerning the people stuck on the planet did seem a bit tacked on; as though it was only there to give more urgency to fixing the transporter. There was no explanation as to why they couldn't use the shuttle and although it was stated that the duplication problem stopped equipment they sent down from working surely they could have still sent warm clothes and blankets! Overall though I think that is a minor quibble as it didn't spoil this good episode.",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Enemy Within (TV Episode 1966)",Get Down With Your Bad Self,"A transporter malfunction splits Captain Kirk into two separate people with opposing personalities, and this is Star Trek at its best.First of all, we have a brilliant premise: dividing Kirk into two emotional halves to examine man's duality is ingenious, because it reveals not only the Captain's but a broader look into our own human nature. This episode also marks the first- and best- transporter malfunction in the history of the Trek franchise, a device that would come to be used, overused, and abused in subsequent series. The fact that the Star Trek writers- only 5 episodes in- were able to envision the potential hazards of their own fictional technology shows you the level of imagination at work here, and it is that creativity that makes the show so enduring.Even from birth Evil Kirk is comically cruel- and thoughtfully lit from below. His first priority is of course to rape Yeoman Janice Rand, the crew member who would function in the First Season as the ship's pin cushion/punching bag. Poor Janice was the abused victim of whatever was wrong with the ship each week, from Charlie X to salt monsters... the girl saw it all. This episode might mark her worst experience to date as Evil Kirk attempts to rape her, only to have Good Kirk convince her that she must be mistaken. For Janice it's a bad dream... and surely enough to warrant a sexual harassment suit that would cost Starfleet zillions and land her an instant promotion to Admiral. But seriously, Janice at least manages to scratch the face of Bad Kirk, making him easy to recognize. It is at this point that the crew realizes what has happened, and it's a blessing that they figure it out this early in the episode. The writers clearly know that their premise carried enough weight to endure even after the crew's discovery. Sadly, future Trek series would delay the discovery of each episode's ""hook"" for as long as possible, drawing it out into an eye-rolling annoyance and making their lead characters look impossibly obtuse. (I'm looking at you, Next Generation)Good Kirk grows weak and unable to lead, and we enter into a great exploration of humanity: man's duality of nature. Kirk is split between yin and yang, masculine and feminine, base and nobility, and he finds that neither side can function without the other. What other primetime network series has openly acknowledged that hostility, lust, and violent nature are essential qualities in a leader? And this was 1966! And the contradiction isn't presented as just a dry theoretical question in philosophy class- this is the textbook example of what TV and movies should be: SHOWING instead of telling. By exploring the premise with the rich visual demonstration of two Kirks we get to SEE the hypothetical question as a reality, and it's much more vivid and powerful. And before anyone gives you the overused, often misunderstood line that Roddenberry's Trek was pure positivity remember it was also unafraid to explore and seek the truth- even when said truth was less than rosy. While I was jabbering on Evil Kirk discovered pancake makeup- standard issue on all Federation Starships- and concealed the scratches on his face. The crew attempts to reunite the two halves of the animal split in the transporter, but in the immortal words of our ship's Doctor: ""He's dead, Jim."" Sulu and the away team are nearly frozen to death and Evil Kirk escapes again. The two Kirks have the inevitable confrontation on the bridge, and Shatner- famous for hamming harder than Boar's Head- actually gives a believable- if not memorable- performance.A fascinating look at the two sides that make up every man, ""The Enemy Within"" is an excellent episode in every sense- Star Trek at its very finest. GRADE: A+",
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Enemy Within (TV Episode 1966)",Definitely one of the best of the Star Trek episodes,"It's obvious from the first few minutes that this episode was written by someone other than the usual formulaic writers of the show. Spock is much more emotional and has a very witty line at the end to Yeoman Rand that is totally out of character but quite amusing. I would say that was the most noticeable difference in this episode from most of the Star Trek episodes: Mr. Spock's behavior. His human, emotional side is showing much more in this episode, I assume as a counterbalance to the literally 2 halves of Captain Kirk. Looking it up on this site, the show was written by the great Richard Matheson, writer of innumerable things but most remembered (by me at least) for Duel and Nightmare at 20,000 Feet (Twilight Zone). This Star Trek episode definitely has that fast, no-nonsense pacing. Many amusing touches are present in this episode too: What type of dog IS that that they have transformed into some creature with a unicorn horn and a rat's tail? Also, don't the scratches on the 2 Kirk's faces keep changing sides? Nice also the way they made the bad Kirk look really evil by using black eyeliner around his eyes.Altogether, a very witty, very fast-paced episode devoid of a lot of the nonsense that tended to bog this show down as it ran its course. And a great bit of philosophy too represented by the message about how we are all the sum of our parts and are better for that. Really, also, a message for the world these days too.Highly recommended!",9

Not to be confused with the episode where Janet Lester takes over Kirks mind by replacing it with her own (where was Shatners Emmy!), or the episode where Kirk is replaced by a mechanical Kirk as part of a plot where humans will be replaced by more perfect machines, or the episode where disembodied aliens, who have their minds stored in mechanical spheres, take over the minds of the crew as part of a mercy mission, or the episode where the crew transports to an alternate universe - where the federation is an 'empire' that rules by maintaining terror, and their counterparts from the evil universe, beam aboard the enterprise (a fan favorite).As the The Enemy Within unfolds, the evil-Kirk becomes more aggressive, and the good-Kirk more indecisive.

6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Enemy Within (TV Episode 1966)",Kirk vs. Kirk,"The Enemy Within is one of the finest episodes of Star Trek's first season, and its central idea has gone on to inspire similar scenarios in other genre shows, most notably Buffy The Vampire Slayer (see episode The Replacement in Season 4). It deals with a classic theme of horror and sci-fi literature, the double, and gives William Shatner the chance to have lots of fun with his role(s).Sticking with formula, the episode starts with a patrol exploring a new planet. Unfortunately, when it's time to beam them back up on the Enterprise, the transport system starts malfunctioning, which results in Captain Kirk being literally split in two: one half is calm and rational, the other determined and impulsive. This triggers a race against the clock, since neither Kirk can survive without the other part, but also because if the transport device isn't fixed in time, Mr. Sulu and the other crew men left on the planet will freeze to death.Having a double of a well known character is always interesting, whether it's an impostor, a robot or something different altogether. In this case, what really makes the story interesting is the fact that the ""replacement"" Kirk isn't a villain in the proper sense of the word: he's just a specific part of the captain's personality, with no rational components to keep the more violent sides of his nature under control. As such, The Enemy Within is a peculiar spin on the traditional Jekyll/Hyde ""myth"", made possible by the infinite possibilities of science-fiction storytelling.More important, though, is what the episode allows in terms of performance: just like Naked Time gave some cast members the opportunity to fool around, this time Shatner has the unique privilege of being able to take Kirk (well, part of him, actually) to some darker places, expanding on the previous episode's idea of the character being torn between duty and private desires. It adds lots of tension, but it's also a very funny double portrayal, and one of the key ingredients of Trek's long-lasting success.",10

Spocks comments at the end of the episode was sexist and defiantly in bad taste. The whole premise of Jekyll and Hyde is shown in this episode, although there is not the murder of rape of women, which would have taken this episode down a darker path.

He mugs and sneers as the evil side while he whimpers indecisively as the other half. The key is to not destroy everything while the lecherous Kirk is chasing Yeoman Rand, trying to assault her sexually. This becomes an uncomfortable series of events. In some ways, it is quite laughable; on the other hand, it is deadly serious. Spock and the others are in a quandary because they must figure out what is going on. Kirk comes and goes and they are suspicious, but they have no reason to suspect anything other than the fact that he is an incredible mess. Science to the rescue.",7

But it does come close to being a great Star Trek episode. Mostly because, in a way, splits down the path of William Shatner as an actor, or how much of an actor he can ever be. After a faulty teleportation back up to ship, ol Kirk is now two, with a doppelganger that beats people to a pulp and makes crude sexual advances to a worker on the ship (probably one of the first instances of attempted rape shown on prime-time TV at the time), while the other 'real' Kirk has lost his will to lead- he's unable to make decisions because his 'evil' side is really the one that takes charge to lead. But what to do as Soolu is stuck on an icy planet? This is all the stuff of pot-boilers, where you keep watching just to see what will make the Kirk's tick- or not- next. It's utterly classic comedy (maybe unintentionally so, maybe meaning to be) as 'evil' Kirk tries to take over the ship incognito, but gets caught when he tries to get the ship away from Soolu and the others! But then there's the existential crisis of 'good' Kirk, as he doesn't have any real resolve as a leader, except in regards to putting himself, literally it seems, back together. In a way it's kind of trashy, and I could see why one or two Trekkies might find it sub-par. But it does give Shatner lots of freedom as an actor, unlike most of the time where he inspires the best in imitators, and I liked the dichotomy of the psychology present, even as dated as it is. How does one balance the good with the bad? Control, it seems, at least is you're James Tiberius Kirk- which includes libido.",9

The ying-yang of how and what drives and keeps a man sane. Shatner is challenged as an actor to give us two extremes of one character; a bipolar portrayal, so to speak. The audience witnesses the theory of what drives a man, and that which stables his more aggressive tendencies.Is the premise true? A single Star Trek episode certainly cannot answer nor adequately extrapolate in a single dramatization, but it is an interesting character study from a purely psychological point of view. While other TV shows were concerned about what dad would do when he got home, Star Trek was examining deep human issues on all levels emotional and scientific levels (or as could be expected by a dramatization of science fiction).Spock sums up the episode's and author's thrust near the end. And Kirk makes the final observation after being thrust into a kind of psychological rehabilitation courtesy Scotty's ""finicky piece of machinery"", remarking on a man's self observance. The idea here is to view ones' various personality traits, reign them in, then expunge them to reconfigure the subject back to psychological norms.Not an episode that comments on any real deep social issues, but one that asks the viewer to look at a fractured man and his reconstitution.",

Captain Kirk is split into two different people - those two halves of himself, reasonable compassion and violent animal - after beaming aboard the ship, while the lives of a landing party hang in the balance planetside.But it's not just an excuse to see dramatically lit Shatner go to town on the scenery (""I'm Captain Kirk! I'M CAPTQAIN KIIIRK!""). And even though some of that silliness adds a bit of fun to this episode, it's more interesting as a study of the duality of our favorite starship captain. It's a great character, and we see how one half isn't Kirk without the other.And it's got some established sci-fi cred in the writing department.

But wasn't in interesting to hear Spock explain how his own intelligence wins out over his human and alien selves?Obviously, with all the trouble keeping track of the doppelganger Kirk, it looked like no one was left in charge of the prop department. The 'phony' Kirk arrived on board the Enterprise without an insignia on his shirt, but showed up with one in subsequent scenes. Similarly, when negative Kirk challenges positive Kirk on the bridge, the scratches have moved to the right side of his face. I always wonder why obvious mistakes like this aren't caught by someone that's part of the creative process.You have to admit, Shatner seems to be having a grand old time in this one. It seems to me it would be more fun to play a villain than a hero, even if the hero (almost) always makes it to the end of the picture. Gene Roddenberry stepped out on a limb with this story, exploring as he did the topic of rape, and even though it involved the villainous Kirk, it was till shocking to see Shatner in that role. Also interesting to see how much screen time Grace Lee Whitney got in these early stories as Yeoman Rand.

The good half becomes utterly ineffectual and wimpy and needs to be merged back with the evil half in order to survive. Most of the episode consists of pursuing the evil half while the good half basically just stands around indecisively, mumbles, and doesn't do much.There is really very little to get out of this episode.

Meanwhile, Sulu and a few other crew members are stranded on the surface in subzero temperatures awaiting transport. Scottie, McCoy, and Spock attempt to fix the transporter and figure out a way to bring back their captain and rescue the crewmen.The two halves that balance into the whole is an interesting concept. The human mind is a much more complex, nuanced entity than symbolized in this episode, but perhaps the metaphor is an apt one. As humans we are often required to bury our more primeval and wanton desires in order to conform to our society. In this episode, we see Kirk's deep, dark nature unfiltered and unimpeded. Animal Kirk's interactions with Yeoman Rand illustrate, maybe not his deepest desires, but assuredly his most primal. Even by modern standards, the scene with the (attempted?) rape is something that is difficult to watch; it is absolutely horrifying.I find it interesting that the show's writer (a Twilight Zone alum) has classified decision-making as something that needs both halves of the self to be successful. Compassionate Kirk is too easily swayed by arguments and is paralyzed by the weight of decisions on his shoulders. Animal Kirk is too blinded by his desires to make decisions and is terrorized by fear. I love that fear is diagnosed as an animalistic emotion.One large issue with this episode is the final scene. Spock's comment is coarse, insensitive, uncalled for, and frankly un-Vulcan. Why he decides to say that Yeoman Rand is beyond me. The writers really made a mistake with that one.But ignoring that glaring blunder, this episode is an enjoyable watch. Exploring human emotion (when done skillfully) is always an interesting experience. (I'm still knocking it one star for Spock's uncouth remark).",7

Why, then, do fans love it so much? Because even the most predictable of concepts can be forgiven when when a character such as Harry Mudd (Roger C. Carmel) is on screen.Mudd's appearance on the Enterprise is a lesson in comedy: his ship is located during a routine mission, with the man and his crew beamed up before the vessel is destroyed. Then, when Kirk asks him about the crew (three women), he candidly replies, with a Scotty-like accent: ""Oh no, Captain, that's me cargo."". As it turns out, good old Harry, who travels under another name because of his criminal record, specializes in finding beautiful women and selling them to lonely men. He obviously knows what he's doing, since his ""cargo"" has a spell-like effect on every male crew member of the Enterprise, Spock not included. However, when the ship runs short of fuel and has to negotiate with workers on a nearby planet, the truth about Mudd's business starts to emerge, and it might as well mean the end of Kirk's five-year mission.As said before, the story isn't very original, as anyone who knows his genre fiction should be able to figure out the ""twist"" about halfway through the episode. And yet the whole thing is quite enjoyable, largely thanks to Carmel, who plays Mudd exactly as he ought to be portrayed: weirdly charismatic, ambitious and unapologetically sleazy. To call him a villain isn't quite accurate: he's just one of those unreliable fellas it's hard to admire, but impossible not to laugh at.Additionally, Mudd's women contains one of Spock's best responses to Dr. McCoy's ""human"" provocations: ""The fact that my internal disposition differs from yours, Doctor, pleases me no end."".

In this episode Mudd functions as a sort of galactic pimp, providing ""wives"" to ""lonely"" settlers in isolated earth colonies. All three of ""Mudd's women"" are otherwise plain women whom the illegal ""Venus drug"" has given unnatural allure. The episode veers unevenly between drama and farce, the male crew of the Enterprise being reduced to a bunch of sex-crazed adolescents; even Spock, as hard as he tries to hide it, feels the heat. The irony is of course that the lithium miners who strike a bargain with Mudd don't really want wives; they're only interested in women as sex objects, not true partners or equals. The irony is that none of the miners are particularly handsome, but they only want beautiful women, nor do they stop to consider that the glamour girls they want would be unlikely to agree spend their lives in a desolate mining camp. To put it succinctly, men are pigs. In the course of the episode the surly miners' boss, Ben Childress (Gene Dynarski) meets his match in Eve McHuron (Karen Steele), the only one of the girls with a conscience. One is left with the impression that despite their rocky start these two have the makings of a genuine connection. Both Dynarski and Steele give excellent performances.

Sure, he can be amusing, but in small doses; after 10 minutes, you want to throw him in the brig to shut him up. He sort of reminds me of the typical characters encountered on the more silly ""Lost in Space"" TV show. Carmel, a good actor, also tended to be something of a ham and couldn't resist some over-the-top scenery chewing.This is one of the weaker episodes of the first season, slow going and uneventful. There's a bit of mystery surrounding the three women, who have an odd effect on all the male crew (except Spock, who looks on bemused), causing involuntary arousal. I was more interested in the early use of the transporter at the beginning of the episode, when Mudd's ship is destroyed, but the women had not yet transported to safety on the Enterprise and, for a few moments, there's a question as to whether they would be. For a few seconds, this means they were neither dead or alive, in some limbo, and it all depended on Scotty's and Spock's deft handling of the machinery. This would mirror similar scenes involving transporter use in later episodes. Towards the final act, our beloved starship is once again in danger of spiraling down to its destruction on the planet it orbits, similar to the much more effective ""The Naked Time"" episode made close to the same time.But there's no sense of actual tension during this episode. Mostly, the captain and his crew are irritated by Mudd and perplexed by the women - that's pretty much it. The entire plot seems somewhat beneath Kirk and his ship to deal with, including the subplot about some possibly illegal drug. Interestingly, Kirk is all business in this episode, with no time for romance. There is one great exchange between Kirk & McCoy as they conjecture on the mysterious aura of the women and at least one fine performance from guest star Dynarski as one of the miners in the 2nd half of the show. He would later appear as a completely different character in a much later episode, ""The Mark of Gideon.""",6
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Mudd's Women (TV Episode 1966)",Wading Through the Mudd,"The series was rolling along, attempting to find its niche. Then along comes this ludicrous entry. Every so often, it seems, the show felt the necessity to become comedic. This is fine if you want your characters to seem human and add some warmth to the continuing confrontations with alien forces. This, however, is rather insulting. It is insulting to women. It is insulting to the direction of the show. And, it is not funny. The character of Harry Mudd (who unfortunately appears later) is a con man wheeler dealer who is delivering mail order brides to miners. These women have something in them that makes them irresistible to men. The males in the crew of the Enterprise fall in line and start to drool. Mudd, of course, has used some chicanery to bring about this result. Kirk must call on some force that must have been implanted in him at the academy (he pulls it out, so to speak, several times before the series is over) in order to defy his inner nature. When one looks at Kirk on the bridge, ogling some blonde, we can see that his inner nature has no shortage of testosterone. Mostly, I found this episode a bore and hoped the show would get back to doing more complex and interesting stories.",5

It is insulting to women, insulting to men, and insulting to the series. It's ""comedy"" is hammy and irritating, and the characterizations are off.I rolled my eyes when I read the premise of the episode, but I didn't expect it to be quite this bad. Initially, I was intrigued by the appearance of the three women and their designation of ""cargo"", and the behavior of the Enterprise's men folk. I even liked their outfits. Surely these women were either weird aliens or drugged up victims of human trafficking. Turns out they were drugged and being trafficked, but they were only victims of their home planets who enslaved them. According to what the writer would have you believe, Mudd ""rescued"" them by convincing them the only way they could possibly be happy was to be beautiful (which they weren't) and get married to ugly desperate men who only care about their beauty (which they don't have). And nobody, absolutely nobody on board the enterprise - despite working alongside women whose inherent value was in the labor they provided, not their looks - thought to try and disabuse these poor women of this notion? Maybe inform them there's a whole universe out there for them to find their happiness? But no, despite them clearly being manipulated by Mudd, despite their clearly abused and warped minds, despite the supposed dangerous effects of the drugs which, incidentally, we never learn about, AND despite the clearly lascivious and careless nature of the men, they supposedly get a good ending? And the MEN are the victims? And eve lives happily ever after with a man who's sole virtue is that he didn't beat or rape her??? I honestly expected that miner to see her ""homely"" and NOT CARE. I expected them to build a repertoire and fall in love and give out the rather cliché-by-now moral that looks don't matter! I would even accept the old fashion cooking and sewing role, which i'm pretty inured to in old TV shows like this. But no. He yells at her for being plain, tells her she should feel bad for tricking him into saving her life (because why would he bother saving a woman unless she beautiful), and only accepts her when she's magically pretty again! And after her disgust at his shallow attitude, she just sits on his lap and decides to stay because- she's pretty? What the f**k??!What was the point of this episode???This episode just disgusted me. And 'that's just the way things were back then' is no excuse. I mainly watch oldies on TV thanks to my elderly parents, and most of those shows are far more ""feminist"" than this utter pile of crap.",1

Instead, he over-taxes the engines and he and his ""cargo"" are nearly killed. The cargo turns out to be three very ordinary-looking women who are supposed to be über-sexy (you can tell because of the sexy jazz riffs that follow them as they slink about the ship).The episode is pretty good because Roger Carmel was wonderful as Harry Mudd--he was funny and sleazy and just a lot of fun to watch. Aside from his performance, though, the rest of it all just seemed ordinary. No magic--just an ordinary show with nothing to especially recommend it.By the way, for Star Trek purists, they keep referring to Lithium Crystals. Later, they changed it to Dilithium Crystals that powered the ship.FYI--The first few episodes were shown in a completely convoluted manner. This is why Uhuru is wearing yellow instead of the familiar ref (which she wore in the first episode aired). This one was filmed BEFORE the first aired episode (""The Man Trap"").",7
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Mudd's Women (TV Episode 1966)",Introducing Harry Mudd,"This classic episode introduces us to the shady Harcourt Fenton Mudd; he is the captain of a small ship transporting an unusual cargo. As the episode opens this ship is refusing to answer calls from the Enterprise and flees into an asteroid field. Here the ship is damaged; in the process of rescuing Mudd and his cargo of three beautiful women the Enterprises lithium crystals are severely damaged. This means they must head to a nearby mining colony to acquire more. While they are heading there the women start to have an effect on the Enterprise's male crew members. It later becomes apparent that these women have been sold as brides and their beauty isn't natural that doesn't bother Mudd though as he plans to be far away by the time his drugs wear off and the new husbands see what the woman really look like. He decides that the miners might pay more for the women than their planned husbands; this leads to trouble when the miners refuse to hand over any crystals till Kirk releases the conman Mudd from custody and without the crystals the Enterprise won't be able to maintain its orbit.This fun episode is the first of two to feature Harry Mudd; Roger C. Carmel does such a fine job as this rogue that it is hard not to see why the character reappears later in 'I Mudd'. The Trio of women look like they could have just stepped off a 1960s catwalk so it is not that surprising that they turned heads. When we see their normal appearance they are obviously quite a bit older and not as glamorous but thankfully the makers of the show avoided the cliché of having them being ancient or ugly. The politics of the episode may little dated with wives being sold but it isn't surprising that such things would happen where there is a gender imbalance and the women are hoping for a better life with relatively wealthy husband if Mudd were around today he would be sending out spam advertising 'beautiful Russian brides'. The episode concludes nicely enough with it looking as though the miners will accept the women for who they really are; ordinary people, and Mudd facing Federation justice for his various infringements of the law. Overall a fun episode but probably not as good as Mudd's second appearance.",8
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Mudd's Women (TV Episode 1966)",Mudd's Women,"Harcourt Fenton Mudd. Rouge trader and smuggler who attempts to evade the Enterprise, driving his inferior ship into a dangerous asteroid belt, narrowly escaping death thanks to Kirk's persistence in transporting him on board instead of the alternative, sacrificing his own ship's Lithium crystals which keep the power operative at effective levels. He has company, however, three women whose beauty hypnotically captivates the males on board the Enterprise, a secret Harry Mudd has in his possession, the Venus drug which ""produces"" loveliness! Seeing DeForest Kelley('Bones' McCoy) and James Doohan (Scotty) all google-eyed and transfixed was hilarious, when their eyes first catch a glimpse of Mudd's Women upon transporting over from the destroyed trader ship (which Mudd ""confiscated""). Spock's reaction to his human crew's inability to shake off the effects of Mudd's Women is also a treat, his observations, not necessarily in word as in the look on his face, particularly when acknowledging to Kirk that he recognizes what is going on around him, not hiding his amusement, though. The rest of the plot concerns Kirk's getting Lithium crystals from a less-than-desirable planet where three miners live and work, prone to magnetic storms with an ionizing atmosphere that can kill humans if they do not protect themselves after a period of time. Regarding the women, Karen Steele (as Eve) has a solid part, just looking for a man to make her happy, butting heads with Jim Goodwin's ornery miner, Farrell. Eve doesn't get along with Mudd but knows that he is kind of her ticket to a potentially more fulfilling life. The Venus drug essentially masks the plainness/ugliness that Eve, Magda (Susan Denberg) and Ruth (Maggie Thrett) are hiding. The drug allows them to appeal to any man, before long the ship is overrun with lust-occupied minds, even Kirk unable to resist the impulse to stare (I just get a kick out of Kirk's stunned silence, the beauty of the women interrupting him mid-sentence as he was starting to scold Mudd for that stunt in the asteroid belt). The suspense of the plot derives from the dying last remaining Lithium crystal keeping the Enterprise running, and how Farrell is playing hardball with Kirk over a supply the crew needs in order to survive, wanting an exchange, the girls (and Mudd's release; Harry is crafty and clever, that's for sure)for the crystals. I really enjoyed ""Mudd's Women"" as a teenager when I first starting watching Star Trek, but as an adult the episode is more than a bit campy. Mudd is basically another Lost In Space's Captain Tucker (Albert Salmi), costumed like an intergalactic pirate, thick voice full of bluster, bushy mustache, always thinking about that next con and how he can benefit himself at the expense of others. I must say that my favorite scene could be Mudd's ""interrogation"", a sort of trial where he must face up to charges, caught in one lie after another thanks to the Enterprise's ""truth machine"".I think he's a fun character, but I am more drawn now to more serious, complex stories within the original Star Trek series. I consider this an amusing diversion, not a sterling example of the much beloved series.",6
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Mudd's Women (TV Episode 1966)","""It's all right darlings, we're in good hands"".","It's pretty apparent that Gene Roddenberry was going to have some some fun with this story. Harcourt Fenton Mudd (Roger C. Carmel) is one of Star Trek's most colorful characters, and the introduction of his 'cargo' is meant to have the viewer sit up and take notice the first time one sees this episode. I have to wonder though, was Roddenberry goofing just a bit with Captain Kirk's dialog just before he learns the identity of those who came aboard in the transporter room? Kirk calls up to Scotty - ""How many did we get off""? By the looks of Scotty and Bones, I'd say just about everyone on deck.And say, how about Mudd's destination with the girls - it was Ophiucus III. Now if you say it slowly and drawl the pronunciation a little, Roddenberry was approaching X-rated territory in the outer quadrant. He also did a pretty good job with the soft focus filter any time the camera put the trio of beauties on display.Still, Kirk managed to remain the paragon of virtue for most of the story. He didn't get leery at all, and it didn't look like he was all that much of a womanizer this early in the series. As far as the mythology of the show went, I believe this episode had the first mention of those valuable lithium crystals. I recall while watching the show in random re-runs back in the day, those lithium crystals seemed to be at the center of the story quite often.",8

This episode begins with the Enterprise in hot pursuit of an unidentified ship, forcing it into an asteroid belt where Kirk decides to risk the safety of the Enterprise to save the unknown crew. Why? A sense of duty? A sense of obligation to a potential enemy? Curiosity? Spite? Mudd beams aboard, Community Actor on Cocaine, costume from the Jesus Christ Superstar reject bin. Just a note here on Star Trek's guest casting: the show often filled key roles with campy, broad actors who seem to have come directly from the stage of the neighborhood theater to the lot at Desilu. These actors often add a sense of mystery to the show, making aliens more believably foreign with their unconventional looks and often strange faces. Because these actors often had no significant career behind or ahead of them their anonymity adds to the unknown of the character- an integral part of Trek's mystique- and makes the show more authentic. I call these players ""Community Actors,"" and they definitely make Trek more fun.Back on the ship, Mudd- speaking in an inexplicably-grating Celtic accent- introduces himself as Leo Walsh and beams over his bevy of buxom babes. These girls are so hot even Spock switches on his light saber. Well, they're supposed to be pretty, but whoever was in charge of casting could surely have found more attractive women for these roles. (Ruthie the seething brunette is surely the prize of the group as the two blondes look like they've been slinging hash one summer too many). Men are supposedly helpless when faced with their mysterious magnetic effect, but that doesn't stop a cranky Kirk from placing Mudd under arrest. It seems personal, like Kirk took an instant personal dislike to Mudd, possibly because the two men were more similar than James T. cared to admit. Am I implying that our bold Captain is only an Academy credit away from winding up as a galactic pimp? Yes.Mudd coaches his cupcakes on how to beat the lie detector before the hearing begins, although it seems like the lesson goes completely over their heads. The ""futuristic"" lie detector used in the hearing is about as primitive and awkward as speculative sci-fi technology gets. (INCORRECT!) The computer reveals Mudd's true identity and full rap sheet- and what a rap sheet! Nice to see someone in the Trek universe is a screwup: a galactic scofflaw, a cosmic anarchist. In spite of his insistence that he's merely a sacred public matchmaker, Mudd is found guilty of being a scoundrel-at-large and sentenced to be sentenced.The power emergency brings the Enterprise directly to Rigel XII, where Mudd gets the idea of the perfect score: fixing the girls up with the lithium miners. In the meantime Ruthie drops by Sick Bay to tease Bones, and she exits as he says: ""I wonder what makes it do that!"" (That's what she said.) Next, Eve- one of the blondes- visits the Captain and appeals to his sense of responsibility- and loneliness- in order to melt him down to fit in the palm of her hand. She breaks down the walls and facades of Kirk in about thirty-seven seconds, then loses her nerve and aborts the mission. The girls- without their drugs- are revealed to be aged, wretched horrors- ugly on the inside? Eve's wrestling with whether or not to take her pill is probably the first visual representation of drug addiction in television history. Mudd is revealed to be worse than the girls' pimp- he is their pusher. A nice parallel is drawn between the burning of the beautiful lithium crystals and the pills that maintain the artificial beauty in the women on board in a cinematic match-cut light-years ahead of its time. The miners are portrayed as intergalactic pigs so desperate for pie that they'll sabotage their own operation in order to land the prized brides. But here's where the story falls apart: the last act has nothing to do with Mudd or his trafficking in women and features an absurd, oversimplified conclusion to the ""beauty-in-a-pill"" plot line.Eve and one of the miners get lost in a magnetic storm while the Enterprise struggles on emergency power. Eve's looks start to fade without the Venus drug and accordingly the miner loses interest in her. (""Let's see other people"") Suddenly Captain K shows up with a fresh dose of the drug and Eve's beauty returns- but the joke is on her as Kirk had given her a placebo! It seems the power to magically transform yourself into a beautiful woman is all in your mind! Huh? Like many first season episodes this raises some interesting issues but waits way too long to resolve them, and the story drifts unevenly between Mudd & his women to leave a less-than-lasting impression. ""A most annoying emotional episode,"" remarks Spock.Oh, he's just jealous. GRADE: B-",
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Mudd's Women (TV Episode 1966)",Settling for less.,"This is a parable about rich frustrated males who've worked their entire lives to pay for top of the line mail order brides; an ages old scam. And once they get their prizes, they find that they're unattractive. The unattractive part comes from real world parallels where former prostitutes from one nation seek a new life in another by offering themselves for marriage. Again, a scam. That's not to say that there aren't honest women in the trade, but, well, if you're going to ""pay for romance"" as it were, then buyer beware.The story shows men desiring love and sex, and when they see what they've paid for, they go ballistic. They fall for the facade, the fantasy, not the real person inside. And therein lies the parable. What is is that determines mating compatibility, and are there degrees of such coupling, or is there a real binary on-off determinant that will decide whether a couple will stay together or part? The episode doesn't address that, but says that if you look into a person's heart, you'll fall in love with whoever you please.Not so.Attraction is only a small component. Physical attraction is a fraction of that component. Real attraction supersedes and transcends all levels, from skin to soul. It's uncovering those layers that the episode suggests that will win the day. That's true, but if you know what you want, and it isn't available, then don't settle for less, or you'll never be happy.One of the three miners lucks out. How? Because his affection, unknown to him, was genuine in the first place, although he did not know it at the time.There's a plot device involved. One that actually may become a reality at some point in the near future. It suggests that sensuality is a character trait and not a mere manifestation of physical makeup. Very true. Yet the episode suggests that everyone can potentially be for everyone else. Not so, for this is actually a clinical solution to settling a male whose own robust testosterone levels have placed him on an uneven keel, and the agent for bringing him back to norm is a female companion. Again, Jarvis finds fortune has smiled on him.But it is not so for others in the real world, for which this particular installment of Trek was meant. And, regrettably, men in the real world who are coupled with women they would not have normally considered for all sorts of reasons, find themselves divorced and financially ruined, or just plain unhappy in a marriage they were maneuvered into with a woman they did not want in the first place. That's the aspect, the honest and real world aspect, that this episode does not address.The episode's profundity is in that we should all look beyond skin and other physical traits. No argument there. But the episode also suggests that if you find something inside a person that you don't like, something deeply repugnant to you, something you never wanted, that you should put up with that quality or trait regardless. That may be a bit of a stretch, but it is a qualifier for this particular installment.Fortunately Kirk and Spock are here to solve things, as the U.S.S. Enterprise again totters on the precipice of disaster. The ship is imperiled, and trading in flesh seems to be the only solution. Things happen, and the most famous starship captain since Tom Swift takes action.Things work out, all thanks to Starfleet Academy training, and the inner story that takes place is actually kind of a lovely one when all is said and done.This is a romance with some plot overtones coupled with some adventure. Take it for what it is. Something tells me the ladies will probably like this episode a bit more than the men.Watch it once.",

The women are being transported as mail-order brides. The presence of the women aboard the Enterprise creates quite a distraction to the men on duty. It turns out that these 3 women aren't your standard beauties, but are putting on a con with Mudd using an illegal substance called the Venus drug that causes them to appear differently than what they are. Mudd tries to get himself out of trouble when the Enterprise makes a pitstop on Rigel XII for lithium crystals. But eventually the truth comes out.This episode has a moral, I'm just not sure what it is. The men aboard Enterprise turn into bumbling buffons in the ladies' presence. The 3 are portrayed as just objects of physical desire for these men who have no interest in any of their other qualities. The miner gets upset when he learns the truth that this woman is more ""homely"" than she appeared when on the drug. But in the end, she takes a placebo pill and it turns out, all she needed was self confidence to be beautiful the whole time. Now that she is beautiful, the miner accepts her again. I guess the moral is that you have to be gorgeous for a man to want to marry you? And that a man should be rewarded for not hitting or molesting a woman? Way to go Star Trek... The only redeeming part of this episode is Roger C. Carmel's portrayal of Mudd. This performance might be detrimental to a good Star Trek episode, but in one so devoid of plot, suspense, and action, Carmel's hammy, over-the-top, mustache-twirling persona is a breath of fresh air. He's really the only thing that could keep my interest over the duration of the episode. Star Trek: Enterprise later did a similar episode involving Orion women, ""Bound"".

The smuggler is a mildly charming sleazebag named ""Harry Mudd""; the three women are sort of intergalactic hussies (to borrow a phrase from Homer Simpson in one of the Treehouse of Horror episodes).Thankfully sex roles have changed a great deal in the interim, but this episode actually wasn't too bad for its time. The basic message is that it takes more than looks and sex to make a serious relationship or a marriage work. Well, that remains true today, natch, although thankfully the genders are much closer to parity now than they were then.

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. Unlike any other hit series, it only has 3 seasons so luckily it means that they will be covering up all their ideas within it until they are satisfied. As it often happens, the first season is always promising and has potential (or else it won't lift up for further more seasons) in it and is utilized with fine detailed work like focusing on different new breeds and characters bonding through this journey. Mudd's Women is probably the lowest dramatic episode till now for it lacks gripping screenplay, unpredictable twists and even better execution.

(TV Episode 1966)","In the Future, not Sugar and Spice","Ah, that Bloch...he managed to impart his feel for the macabre onto a science fiction show, and one of the best ones, at that. The result was a chilling meditation on attempting to find out what passes for the soul or the mind of a human being - how much of what we are can be copied or passed on to another receptacle; are we really just glorified computer programs? Or, you can just look at this as the serious version of ""I,Mudd"" - the final exploration on androids. Well, not so final, as this was an early blueprint for the entire saga of Data on the TNG series and movies, from 1987 to 2002. Here are asked the early questions about the ethics and dangers of creating a race of androids. This leaned towards the concept of Data's evil twin, Lore, in seeking an answer, but it's not so much a concept of evil as just a horror story about science going sideways.The one who poses these questions is the famous Dr. Korby, missing for 5 years on a desolate, frozen planet. The audience finds out that Nurse Chapel is his fiancée (how this jibes with her revealed secret passion for Spock from several episodes earlier I do not pretend to understand). I would think Kirk learned his lesson in this episode about the unreasonable dangers of beaming the captain of a starship by himself into the unknown; he rationalizes that the well-reputed Korby has made this request so it must be OK. Well, Korby turns out to be not quite all there and soon Kirk is the guinea pig in his experiments on android creation. This is also another sample of some long dead civilization with highly advanced technology being found by the current humans of the 23rd century; it's a recurring theme of potentially new techniques being uncovered and of such potential probably scattered all over the galaxy for us to find. Such story lines can also be traced back to Star Trek's precursor, ""Forbidden Planet"" from 1956. Kirk more or less ignores such potential and so represents the side of thought that certain technology is best left alone, or is perhaps unethical.The androids we encounter here are quite memorable. First, gaining an amusing look of obvious suspicion and envy from Chapel, you have the female-shaped Andrea, played by the perfectly-formed brunette Jackson. Then there's the huge, monstrous Ruk, played with scary precision by the towering Cassidy. The scenes of him tossing Kirk through the air like some toy still carry an eye-popping visual charge; you really get the impression that Kirk is just one twist of an android wrist from being snapped in two during most of the episode. Then Kirk meets himself - yes, it's another example of a Kirk doppelganger show (as the recent ""The Enemy Within""), but again, with that chilling tone. The episode becomes even more effective in the final act, when there are truly chilling revelations and shocking tragedy awaiting at least one character. Kirk's last line on the planet before returning to the ship stays in the mind for awhile afterward.",8
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" What Are Little Girls Made Of? (TV Episode 1966)","""Androids don't eat, Miss Chapel.""","What Are Little Girls Made Of? is a little classic in the Star Trek saga, primarily because it features one of the best uses of Majel Barrett (Gene Roddenberry's wife at the time) as Nurse Chapel, a fact that proves no role is really secondary in this series.Nurse Chapel's expanded presence is dictated by the fact that Kirk is going to beam down on the planet where her fiancé, Dr. Roger Korby, from whom no one has heard anything in a long time, and she insists on joining him since she can't wait to see if Korby is still alive. Once they're on the planet, however, a nasty surprise awaits them: Korby's obsession with technology has driven him insane, and his new expertise regarding the construction of androids prompts him to build a replica of Kirk that could take over the Enterprise.Predating Balde Runner by sixteen years, this episode, like many others, provides a riveting and well-written exploration of the theme of humanity, more specifically what makes man different from machines (or aliens for that matter). Tha script is praiseworthy because it depicts Korby as a genuinely flawed human being, not a traditional mad scientist, just like Nurse Chapel isn't another heartbroken woman who serves as a mere plot contrivance. Plus, much like The Enemy Within, any episode where Kirk has to face another version of himself is a lot of fun to watch. A little classic, indeed.",9
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" What Are Little Girls Made Of? (TV Episode 1966)",Actually a look at a 19th Century mystery,"The Enterprise is sent out to find an expedition that has been missing for 5 years on an Earth like planet. The planet has earth like gravity and a breathable atmosphere but it's average temperature is -100 degrees Fahrenheit! The missing expedition is or was headed by Dr. Roger Corby; whose last message to Earth talked about finding traces or remnants of an early civilization on that planet. After he sent out the message all contact with the expedition was lost. Two search expeditions were sent out to find him in the intervening period but were unsuccessful. Why the Enterprise is being sent to search at such a late date is unclear in this episode. Spoke briefly indicates early on, in reply to a question about the possibility of finding anybody alive, that is is ""highly unlikely"" that there are any survivors. So, why is the Enterprise even there? Should not Dr. Corby have been written off by Star fleet by that point? The answer lies in 19th century history. In the mid 1840s a British expedition named ""The Franklin Expedition"" (named after the commander, NOT after Benjamin Franklin) sailed into the Arctic to find the ""Northwest Passage"". They did meet another civilization albeit the Inuits (who were already known to explorers) and then, they disappeared. Search parties were sent into that area and searched for about 5 years but did not find the expedition. After that period of time the ~120 officers and men and two ships were written off the Admiralty lists. Yet, there was a desire to know what actually happened even though the officers and men were certainly dead so some years later a single ship (the ""Fox"") made one last foray into the Arctic to find out what happened to the ill fated expedition. In this episode the Enterprise is making the same type of last ditch Arctic search that the ""Fox"" made in 1857. The ""Fox"" found a last note from the leader of the Franklin expedition. By analogy, in this episode, at the beginning, the Enterprise also receives a message from Corby himself! Why, exactly, they received a message when previous searchers did not is not really explained (the Fox hunted for the Franklin Expedition in a different area than previous expeditions had searched for-the Enterprise seems not to be doing anything different than the previous expeditions had done so there is a little mystery here). There was, for many years in the mid to late 19th century, speculation that there were some survivors of the Franklin Expedition somewhere in the Arctic though survivors were never found; only relics. Nobody knows when the last Franklin crew member finally perished, but he did so without being found. In this episode the writers are stating there are survivors found, despite realistic analysis indicating they should have all died by then, of a lost expedition. The episode is really a 'what if"" Franklin expedition members had been found; though the setting is not the 19th century but the 22nd. Still, one can see the analogy.",9
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" What Are Little Girls Made Of? (TV Episode 1966)",Cool stuff--see Lurch the Butler AND a woman with a really sexy costume!!,"This is a really nifty episode and the first one that gave Nurse Chapel a chance to develop as a character. An old lover of hers, Roger, was thought to be lost but he suddenly sends a message to the nearby Enterprise! A great coincidence that this particular ship is passing by, huh?! Anyways, they are totally shocked--not only because they thought he was dead but because the planet is a frozen wasteland! Kirk and Chapel transfer down along with some ""red shirts"" (you know, extras who you KNOW are dead meat--destined to die and die quickly). There, they discover Roger is in an underground city created by another race centuries before--and it made for a lovely home for Roger and his robot helpers that he mostly created. It seems that Roger had stumbled upon technology that made androids that looked 100% human. One robot is an assistant (who is also a red shirt) and the other is an über-sexy nymph that Kirk later seduces (wow--Kirk is so studly that he even gets robots hot!!). The third robot is Ted Cassidy (""Lurch"" from the Addams Family TV show) and he was created not by Roger but by the original inhabitants of the planet who were now long gone.Unfortunately, Roger turns out to have a lot of secrets--one of which he is certifiably insane. He takes Kirk and Chapel prisoner and proceeds to make a perfect copy of Kirk. I'm not really sure why, but I think this was done as an excuse to get Shatner mostly naked (try to control yourself, Trekkie ladies). Where the plot goes from there, you'll just need to see for yourself, but rest assured that there are a lot of entertaining aspects to the show. My favorite of which is ""Ruk"" (Ted Cassidy)--a truly cool-looking and frightening android who practically steals the show. Also, the episode is well-written and has a lot of nice twists that keep it from being boring.",8

Basically, Nurse Chapel--Dr. Roger Korby's old flame--together with Captain Kirk beam down to an isolated planet for what they imagine is a friendly get together with the doctor. Unfortunately...for Kirk, Dr. Korby has other ideas and forces Kirk to make a clone of himself in order to seize control of the Enterprise. This is a memorable episode with a compelling and powerful ending when you discover who Dr. Korby really is. Its a remarkable show when you consider that Sulu and Scotty were did not appear in this episode and has to be considered a Star Trek classic. The episode does indeed have an extremely well written script and several emotional scenes such as when Nurse Chapel get a kiss from Uhura before beaming down to see her long-lost fiancée and Dr. Korby's haunting words to Chapel when she discovers Korby's true identity.",9

There is a really tangible feeling of menace and the unknown, as Kirk and Nurse Chapel explore some mysterious caverns, while searching for her former fiancé, a famous scientist.Acting is top notch, with a performance of restrained power by Ted Cassidy as a cryptic android, and a more nuanced Kirk from Shatner, without his later tendency to go over the top. Majel Barrett displays a fuller presentation of Nurse Chapel than any other episode I can recall, with fine supporting performances by Michael Strong as Dr. Korby and a touchingly vulnerable Sherry Jackson as the lovely android Andrea.A clever and intriguingly unpredictable storyline from author Robert Bloch and some atmospheric sets make this a remarkably good episode that has stood the test of time well. Highly recommended.",10

Nurse Chapel (Majel Barrett, the one time Mrs. Gene Roddenberry) is really a peripheral character in most episodes. Her she has a chance to star. The one consistent factor here is that Christine really loves Spock. It shows up in succeeding episodes and, of course, it's a hopeless dream for her. In this she has joined an away team to a planet where a former lover of hers has been for over five years. When she gets there, all hell breaks loose. First of all, the guy has two of Kirk's crew killed by the gruesome Ted Cassidy, formerly of ""The Addams Family."" It turns out that the boyfriend has been working on building a herd of androids to take over the universe. It has one of the great scenes where Kirk, realizing he is about to be cloned, repeats a series of words over and over, telling Spock, ""I'm tired of your half-breed interference!"" What happens depends on the perceptions of the crew and an understanding of who is who. It has a sad conclusion for all concerned but particular for Nurse Chapel. It's a pretty tight little episode with some especially neat settings.",8

Indeed Korby is alive and has an unusual request..for Kirk to beam down alone (that is until he hears Chapel's voice and delightedly welcomes her to beam down as well) because of a secret he wants the Captain to see before anyone else knows about it. What Kirk encounters—androids—will create a difficult scenario where he is held prisoner by Korby who has plans for replacing humans with robotic replicas. How Kirk will warn Spock when Korby makes an exact replica of the Captain as part of his plot is quite clever. Michael Strong is Dr. Roger Korby, seemingly sincere in the idea that he is *helping* the human race, not harming it by substituting a mortal body for a perfect eternal one. This particular episode may be most remembered for guest-starring Ted Cassidy (Lurch of ""The Addams Family"") as a hulking robot named Ruk who lifts Kirk off his feet and hurls him across a room (after an attempted escape) like a rag doll. That and the luscious Sherry Jackson as one of the sexiest fembots you'll ever likely see, in this smoking ""X outfit"" that just barely keeps her breasts in place, showing plenty of skin—yep, as you must know Kirk gets to kiss her on the lips not once, but twice (the second time, of course, has Kirk pulling her in tight when she seems to reluctantly resist). Barrett uses her eyes effectively, especially when Sherry Jackson appears for the first time, and rightfully so considering her man has been on the planet with her for several years. As you also must know, there are two security guards who fall prey to Ruk— we cannot go an episode without some colorless extras getting killed, now can we? The Enterprise crew factor very little in this episode of Star Trek as practically the entire story takes place on the planet inside a ruins guarded against the cold temperature thanks to the mechanical beings (the race who created them are extinct, perhaps a dark omen for Korby who seems to be walking in their footsteps). The twist regarding Korby is a nifty bit of irony.",7

With this knowledge Kirk is a little surprised when Dr. Korby responds to the Enterprise's message. Korby asks Kirk to beam down alone as he has made certain discoveries but when he learns Nurse Chapel is aboard he invites her to come too. Things get off to a bad start when there is nobody to meet them; a couple of red shirts beam down but don't last long; a giant humanoid soon dispatches them while Kirk and Nurse Chapel are met by one of Dr. Korby's colleagues; he is acting rather strangely though.When they finally meet Korby they soon learn that the planet's original population had moved underground when it froze. They then became more mechanised; creating androids like the being we saw killing the red shirts. This android, Ruk, isn't the only one; Korby's colleague and Andrea, a beautiful woman, are also androids. Korby, a renowned scientist has plans to create far more androids starting with an exact replica of Kirk!This is a pretty good episode; it was nice to see minor character Nurse Chapel take a leading role; Majel Barrett puts in a good performance. The story was enjoyable even if it is yet another that features a 'fake Kirk'. Ted Cassidy was suitably threatening as Ruk; his immense stature making him more formidable that most 'nearly human' aliens that feature so often in the 'Star Trek' universe; the scene who he picked up Kirk and threw him across a room was great. Michael Strong did a solid enough job as Korby and Sherry Jackson was likable as Andrea. I'm sure most viewers will realise that there is something wrong with Korby long before he comes out with his crazy plans; it is a little surprising that Nurse Chapel takes so long to realise he isn't quite the man she once knew. The way that Kirk alerts Spock to the fact that something is wrong was rather entertaining. Overall a solid enough episode which lets most of the main cast, apart from Kirk, take a back seat.",7
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" What Are Little Girls Made Of? (TV Episode 1966)","""Survival must cancel out programming"".","The one aspect of this story that intrigues me is one that none of the other reviewers on this board has touched on so far. This was the first time Gene Roddenberry, along with writer Robert Bloch, used what would become a repeated Star Trek gimmick, the use of a conundrum to trip up the main character(s). It's when Kirk forced Ruk (Ted Cassidy) to remember his original programming, which wouldn't have allowed him to save Kirk from the bottomless pit, even if he (Ruk) was ordered by Dr. Korby (Michael Strong) to obey Nurse Chapel's command. Kirk would have done everything necessary to protect the Enterprise, even if it meant challenging Korby and Ruk himself. This conundrum was a little weak though, and would be done to greater effect in later stories.I have to say, in one respect, this episode certainly lived up to the Star Trek tag line. Andrea's (Sherry Jackson) costume boldly went where no one had gone before. In fact, without going back to prior episodes to actually check, I'd have to say that the skirts on Uhura and Chapel were visibly shorter than previously seen in the show's brief run. And speaking of Nurse Chapel, how was it that just two episodes prior in 'The Naked Time', she expressed an admiration for Spock. But of course, she would have presumed her old flame Korby to be dead. Which he was when you come right down to it, as this story's twist ending eventually revealed.Another revelation made here - Captain Kirk has a brother in the service named George Samuel. Unless I'm mistaken, I don't think we ever heard about Sam again. It's a big universe.",7
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" What Are Little Girls Made Of? (TV Episode 1966)","Superb Dark Story, Not A Typical Star Trek Episode","This is not a typical episode of STAR TREK. There is no happy ending. Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, don't work together as a team. Kirk fights, but he doesn't win; in fact he gets thrown around like a rag doll! He doesn't come up with any answers, and he doesn't make any heroic speeches. The main villain and his followers aren't really outwitted, they almost literally self-destruct. Nothing changes for the better, and when the truth is revealed no one is happy with what they discover! Yet with all that, this is one of the strongest early episodes. Dr. Korby is one of the most sinister and chilling of all Star Trek villains. His downfall is chilling because his goals are so very seductive and universal. Who doesn't want to cheat death? Who wouldn't make the choice he made, and who wouldn't be driven mad by turning into what he became?Michael Strong is superb as the most tormented of mad scientists, a villain who becomes increasingly repulsive until the shocking truth makes him appear more pitiable than anything else. Bear in mind, Strong was an actor who could play any part, from cold, calculating scientist to a blue collar slob. It's a hoot to watch this episode and then catch him in the old American Playhouse production of THE ICEMAN COMETH, where he plays Chuck the Bartender. (""Can ya imagine me having a robot wife, Kirk? The kind of robot that, if you lined up all the other robots she stayed with, they'd reach to Chicago!"")And speaking of robot wives, the stunningly beautiful Sherry Jackson is one of the most memorable and frightening of Kirk's many conquests, since she takes a stock fantasy figure and turns her into someone . . . or something . . . both chilling and pitiable. Her final cry (""love me"") is a mini- tragedy that matches the major tragedy of Dr. Korby. Robert Bloch wrote an incredible story here, a tragedy that has all the clammy, claustrophobic terror of PSYCHO and the creeping paranoia of the Cold War. The horror grips you and never lets you go.

Also down there is an almost seven foot android played by the Addams Family former butler Ted Cassidy. He's a survivor still running the machinery of the old civilization that died out long ago. He's also quite protective of that and those that are on the planet.Strong and Barrett are an item, but it becomes clear that Strong has developed some sinister technology and with it sinister ideas from the civilization from long ago which we never learn the name of.The driven Strong and Cassidy star in this Star Trek story.

A man who gets so wrapped up in creating his own little world, complete with a big lummox to protect him and a sex-doll, that's he is forever lost to a world of fantasy. A fantasy created in his mind by being alone for untold years, such that his solitude has driven him to the point of insanity. He has, in essence and fact, lost himself.That's pretty much the allegory of the android making machine. Dr. Korby's madness is facilitated by a relic of ancient technology that can help facilitate and bring forth his fantasies. So much that he has lost his sense of right and wrong. Nothing will stop this man from satiating his appetite to get that next cerebral high. His neurons crave it. But he also craves to leave.He is, after all, a criminal. Was he always so?

As a kid I always took it to be one of those mad-scientist creates robot monsters kind of deal. I think I understand it a little bit better now, and I think I now know why I instinctively shied away from this episode. On a kid level ""it's dumb... bleh... boring!"", but on a deeper primeval level it shows just how disgusting a twisted mind can be. Think about it. This episode didn't have to be what it was, but the author was showing us the dark abysses of a human mind gone fatally wrong. I mean, Captain Kirk and Nurse Chapel could've beamed down, greeted Doctor Korby, who then would have stopped both persons, and said something like ""Hey, look, I'm glad you're here, but you ought to know something about me and this place...""

Like many of these early episodes, it was also full of silly moments, but those are largely forgivable considering the time when this was made. My favorite, probably unintentionally hilarious, moment: (female android to Kirk android): ""Kiss me."" (Kirk android): ""No, it is illogical."" After which she incinerates him with her phaser! Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, even an android woman!Kirk did a good job here of being appropriately cautious, ordering down two security guards and trying to arrange for a security team on standby. I don't think McCoy even appeared in this episode, which is a bit odd.From the outset, it's pretty clear that ""Roger Korby"" is out of his mind. His dumb scheme to secretly build androids then have them 'infiltrate' society would never work. I know the writers sort of had to concoct a scenario in which humans came out on top over machines (morally, as well as actually), for various reasons (not the least of which is the fact that the idea of sentient androids is indeed a frightening premise on many levels) but the possibilities raised in this episode are not nearly as unthinkable today, as they were then. Who knows? Transferring human consciousness to an external device is still a rather tall order and may very well not be possible; but the construction of a functional artificial intelligence with consciousness is not as far-fetched a notion as it once was.This episode aired after ""The Naked Time"", in which Chapel confessed her love for Spock, suggesting that her engagement was an idea they came up with on the fly for this episode.I wonder if Majel Barrett and Rodenberry were already together at this point? Supposedly, Rodenberry also had an affair at one point with Nichelle Nichols (Uhura). That guy sure got around.That line near the end by Kirk was great: ""Dr. Korby was never here.""",7

He kept his promise, but fortunately she only became an irrelevant little nurse, a dull side-character that is barely visible. When Chapel first sees the android Andrea, the jealousy isn't acted: it is very real.

Sherry Jackson is hands down the most beautiful woman that ever appeared in any ST episode or movie. (I've barely seen any of the 80s/90s spin-offs (up to 30 seconds is as much as I can take of that plastic crap), but judging from the ugly and average females that infest those crews, they couldn't have had particularly attractive guest stars either.) Watching Andrea and Nursy in the same scene was a dramatic contrast: like watching a brand-new Ferrari and a worn-down Yugo, parked next to each other. If only Majel's eyes could have killed...WALGMO has a decent story, a unique feel and location, and plenty of twists and other things going on. The element of cheesiness is smaller than the average episode, but there are still some cute 60s-TV aspects to be amused by, like Kirk getting lifted and thrown down about half a dozen times by Richard Kiel's long-lost brother, plus the grand finale which has most of the androids conveniently killing each other off so that the humane Kirk and his crew of do-gooders wouldn't have to do the dirty deed themselves. The only drawback I can think of in what is one of the best episodes is Michael Strong in the role of the mad scientist; unconvincing. The kiss between him and Majel was a brief but very low point.Kirk's double is more animated and more grin-happy than the real Kirk - i.e. much more like the Kirk from Season 3!This is the only good switcheroo/someone-has-a-double episode.If you want to read ST's ""lost episode"", called ""The Chapel Factor"", contact me by e-mail.",

His long term objective is to build a legion of androids and insidiously sneak them into the human population. Of course, Kirk and Chapel won't join him, but there's no telling what Corby might do to anyone who refuses to cooperate.The good: the character of Roger Corby is fascinating because he sincerely believes he is doing the right thing, and sincerely wants to work constructively with Kirk and Chapel. But he might be a very likable and ultimately dangerous madman. Also, the interplay between Kirk and his android double, and between Kirk and Chapel, is solid writing.But surrounding all this is a script that keeps letting down its promise. Towards the climax, Kirk suddenly, and without any foreboding, starts turning the androids against their master. He confuses one by snogging her (this would not be the last time Kirk would try to snog his way out of trouble) and the other just suddenly blows up with rage against Corby on the slightest suggestion from Kirk.

It's concept also is not the most original having been a common feature of Science Fiction before this episode. It's execution while good isn't amazing and just adds to the somewhat ""Been here done that"" feeling of the episode. The main villain of the episode being the Doctor and ""Rock"" aren't to imposing and just add to the somewhat slowness of the episode. This episode is not without it's charm though as the special effects are very good and the acting is played solid. A good episode but watching it feels very slow.",7

As the episode unfolds, we find out what this doctor has been up to these past 5 years. There's a lot to like about this episode: the great concepts introduced, the presence of the hulking Ruk bringing fear to both Kirk and the audience, the camera work. There's definitely a sense of dread and darkness surrounding this episode. The scene where Ruk stares down at Kirk on the ledge is fantastic. I also enjoy the android machine, spinning Kirk around at dizzying speeds as we watch from above. That's probably my favorite shot. All of that makes for great television. I would rate this higher but the ending gets very clunky. Kirk confusing Ruk doesn't make any sense. Why would he forget what happened to him in the past? Andrea's understanding of the concept of love comes at a very convenient time. You can see the doctor's android body reveal coming from a mile away.

Especially after she spilled the beans about her desire for the Captain to notice her legs before this adventure began. Actually, if the series was ever going to go in that direction, Kirk and Rand might have made a nice couple. I'm sure there was some Federation statute that prohibited that though.The story had an interesting premise but had to come up with some contrivances to keep it going. Like the stolen communicators - come on! Would any member of the crew just leave one of those just simply laying around? Especially the Captain! Not buying it.But hey, a death sentence for each child upon entering puberty - that's a compelling concept. Particularly when a hundred years only adds a month to your physical age in Earth terms. I'm thinking about how all of this had to fit into place to make the story work but it kind of falls apart when put to the test. The remaining food on the planet is about to run out JUST as the Enterprise crew arrives. The crew has ONLY seven days to find a cure or die. The story doesn't naturally play out so much as it is forced to a conclusion.I liked Kim Darby in her role as Miri though. She had kind of a Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz"" quality about her which seemed to work. And if Michael J. Pollard wasn't a real person, I think someone would have had to invent him. He was one of the freakiest looking dudes to come on the scene in the Sixties and Seventies, with a perfect look for the types of roles he would eventually get to play.",7
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Miri (TV Episode 1966)","""I never get involved with older women""","Miri is one of the strongest and most gripping episodes of the original Star Trek, providing a pretty shocking spin on the age-old post-apocalyptic Earth scenario (except for the fact that none of this takes place on Earth, obviously).The location is a planet which is an exact replica of Earth: same continents, atmosphere, buildings (albeit a bit old-fashioned) and people. Actually, there's a problem with the people: the planet is inhabited exclusively by children. No Stephen King-like twists (à la Children of the Corn), though: as Miri (Kim Darby) explains to Kirk, all the adults were wiped out several years ago by a virus which doesn't affect children. Dr. McCoy quickly comes to the conclusion that the virus works only on individuals who have already reached puberty, and with every crew member of the Enterprise - apart from Spock, as usual - starting to show symptoms, their exploratory mission becomes a race against the clock to find an antidote before someone gets killed, be it by the virus or Miri's more uncooperative ""peers"".A lot of science-fiction thrives on the idea of what our planet would be like without specific groups of people. In this case, however, the story serves as a much more potent reflection on a seemingly trivial theme like puberty: a simple plot gimmick like a virus becomes a powerful metaphor, using the opportunities given by the sci-fi context to explore previously uncharted territory and delivering a compelling portrait of young people yearning to be part of the grown-up world even though they aren't quite ready for that yet (this is most obvious in the case of the titular character and her feelings for Kirk). The fact that it's a tense and scary story helps a lot, too.",10

Soon you see why, as the most hideous-looking moldy-looking crazed maniac attacks the crew! It seems that on this galactic hell-hole, once a child hits a certain age, a man-made bacteria makes them look like blue cheese and think like Charles Manson!!! The crew realizes that they, too, have become infected and can't leave unless they find a cure! The plot is excellent and the episode is quite interesting, but I also have to admit the kids were at times really annoying. After a while, I really wanted to see the crew slap them really hard--particularly that really ugly troll-like kid who kept yelling ""Bonk, Bonk"". But, despite this and a few embarrassing moments concerning the pubescent Miri's infatuation with Kirk, this was a fun and compelling episode.

3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Miri (TV Episode 1966)",A planet with no adults,"The crew of the Enterprise are surprised when they receive an old style SOS message in an area of space far beyond previous human exploration. They are even more surprised to discover it is coming from a planet that is a duplicate Earth; even the continents are identical. When a group consisting of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Yeoman Rand and a redshirt beam down they find an apparently abandoned city. They are not alone though; they are soon attacked by a hideous creature who seems strangely concerned about his broken tricycle! This creature soon dies and McCoy notes that it had an incredibly high metabolic rate.They then meet a girl, called Miri, who appears to be frightened of them just because they are adults, or grups (grown-ups) as she calls them. It is soon established that about three hundred years previously the planets scientists had been working on a medicine that would give effective immortality it didn't work as planned. It worked for the children who now only age a month for every century that passes but for adults, and children who reach puberty it means very rapid aging and madness. It isn't long before the away team start to show signs that they are effected; McCoy reckons they have a week to find a solution before they succumb to its effects. Not wanting to spread the disease to the rest of the crew they work in a local lab. It will be a race against time and it is made much harder when the other children steal their communicator. As the week passes Miri becomes closer to Kirk but gets jealous when she hears Yeoman Rand expressing her feelings for the captain.This, the first of numerous 'parallel Earth' stories has an interesting premise if you can overlook certain details; there is no explanation of where the children have been getting food and clothes from for the last three hundred years nor are we told how they dealt with any injuries that they would no doubt have suffered. Guest star Kim Darby did a fine job as young Miri; I'd never have guessed that she was actually nineteen when this was made. The rest of the children weren't so good though; their leader was clearly played by somebody far too old to be alive in this world and the rest were just annoying and incredibly immature even given the lack of adult supervision I found myself hoping Kirk might thump one particularly annoying brat. It was interesting to see Yeoman Rand finally tell the captain that she had been trying to catch his eye; I'd always rather liked Grace Lee Whitney's character; it is a shame she was dropped after a few more episodes. The effects of the disease were suitably unpleasant; the fully infected 'monster' that attacks in the early scenes was quite hideous! Overall a decent enough episode that would have been really good if most of the children weren't so annoying.",7

You can tell the writing is bad at the very start of the episode when they run across an 'exact' copy of Earth. The likelihood of running across and exact duplicate of Earth right down to the continents is just astronomical and stretches the imagination beyond the willful suspension. And it is so unnecessary, the author's intent is obvious, this is a moral story and he wants to set the here is our future if we don't pay attention setting for the story. But he could just as easily have done it on an 'Earth-like' planet and make it much more believable. The series abounds with parallel human planets, so an exact copy of Earth not only is not necessary but now begs for an explanation that we don't get.The other issue is the age of the children, one would think that after 300 years they would have developed a little mentally even if their physical age was retarded. But that at least is something we could overlook as its not beyond imagining that the disease slowed mental progression as well.The story overall is good ideas and the moral comes across well enough but it could have been done so much better with a little imagination towards just what a society of children would really be like after 300 years.",6
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Miri (TV Episode 1966)",An Earth Where Children Play Eternally - Almost,"The science fiction premise in this one is faulty - it's better suited for one of those parallel dimension stories or alternate histories. In another part of the galaxy, the Enterprise comes across another Earth; this is an exact duplicate of the Earth we know, except that on this one, in the 1960s, an artificially-created plague wiped out all adults, leaving children who age only a month for every 100 years. This begs a question: if no plague had occurred, would this Earth's civilization have progressed to form its own Starfleet and then the two Starfleets would run across each other and..? Of course, it's ludicrous and just an impossible set-up - an Earth with the exact same continents - the odds are probably trillions to one against.The set design was pretty good for a TV series: Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Rand and two red-shirts beam down into the middle of a dilapidated city. So, we are to assume they weren't able to detect the still-lethal virus in the air; the landing party all contract the disease and are slated to die in a week, except Spock, who is a carrier and is stuck on the planet regardless. A bunch of kids scamper amid the ruins and cause some trouble by stealing the communicators. Kirk & McCoy start to swipe at each other in frustration as the deadline looms. I'm wondering if there is a correlation between no fatalities occurring during a Trek story and so-so episodes of the first season; there's some tension but a ho-hum tone by the end. With many of the characters being juveniles, there's too much 'bonk-bonk on the head' and repetitive-style silly dialog which was designed for children to verbalize.These were early roles for Darby, playing the title character, and Pollard as the weird-looking main troublemaker with the strange name. She went on to ""True Grit"" in '69 and he to ""Bonnie and Clyde"" in '67. Darby was somewhat touching as the girl on the verge of womanhood, while Pollard...well, he applied some method acting but he seemed anywhere from 15 to 35 years old in his scenes; I couldn't decide on which. This episode was also probably the closest that Kirk and Rand came to admitting they had romantic feelings for each other. Rand (Whitney) was booted off the show soon after.",6

They were terrified of the fate that awaited them as they entered adolescence---and no matter what they did they were powerless to escape. So Kirk and Co. had to find a cure for the terminal illness, and it was Dr. McCoy who found it; he stuck his neck out and tested it on himself and discovered that it worked. And finally, when the captain, addressing the kids, said ""I'm a grup---and I want to help you"", they listened. So after all the trials and tribulations and anxieties all was satisfactorily resolved. A good story---and a message of hope.",9

Soon the landing party realise that they can't return to the Enterprise, being disease carriers themselves, and that they will start dying within a week if they don't find a cure.OK, many parts of this episode are flawed, but overall I enjoyed it. It notably provided a good acting role for Kim Darby, who later had a starring role in the John Wayne film 'True Grit'. She was nineteen years old here, but doesn't look it.Grace Lee Whitney as Yeoman Rand was, as ever, very fetching. Too bad she wasn't given more interesting parts, and likewise too bad that she wasn't included in later episodes. Rumour has it that off-stage entanglements were responsible for her leaving the show and that this perhaps precipitated a major downturn in her life. All very sad.By this time in the first series, (in contrast with some earlier episodes), Spock's eyebrows had settled down, he'd stopped shouting, (not to mention smiling occasionally) and the other characters had similarly stabilised.Some of the concepts in this episode are interesting, even if they are not explored thoroughly; for example the idea that adults might be responsible for everything evil in the world, that the passage through puberty is just a step towards death, and that the sins of the fathers will be visited on the children. There are numerous plot holes, and unexplained aspects of the whole situation. It could have been a better episode than it was, I am sure.However in general the plots of the first series of Star Trek show the greatest leaps of imagination and some of the most dramatic moments. Very many of the later episodes seem more like variations on a previous theme by comparison.I have just seen the restored version which has been converted to widescreen, mostly without obvious cropping. It looks pretty good for the most part, but without being told, future film buffs will be able to date the conversion very accurately; early on in the episode there is a fight scene, and the folk that did the conversion appear to have taken the opportunity to zoom in and then manipulate the image to give the effect of the (briefly popular, always dismal) 'shakey-cam' style of shooting (FFS). Thankfully this is not repeated.Although this episode is flawed, I give it an 8/10.",8

One of the saving graces of STAR TREK was often the acting- and, in this case, the performances all around are worthy of note. While I thought that Patrick Stewart was great as Picard (and Jeffrey Hunter as Pike would've made an interesting lead), the charismatic William Shatner remains my favorite Captain of the Enterprise. Shatner was capable of handling the most intense drama or the lightest of moments with equal aplomb. Grace Whitney even manages to show a bit of range here, as well, but it's Kim Darby and Michael Pollard as two kids teetering on the edge of adulthood who command center stage.

Secondly, nowhere is it mentioned that they are retarded, yet I have to assume it because the brats think that only CERTAIN brats die when they reach puberty, but not all. Certainly, having lived there for 300 years they should have all realized many years before Kirk's arrival how things work, right? And check out the dumb way in which Kirk & co. have their equipment stolen, the pathetic explanation being that the kids ""move like mice"". Yeah, right...

It's actually quite a good episode: interesting sci fi premise (an attempt to retard the aging process that partially works, but also backfires, in that, upon reaching pubescence, death is painful and rapid, which prevents future reproduction); an interesting dilemma (desperate need to find a vaccine in a limited time period); and solid writing, acting, and direction. The young actress who played ""Miri"" did a fine job.There were some points of mild irritation. The kids were pretty annoying, but at least they finally listened to reason; I'm glad Kirk was able to get through to them eventually. Yeoman Rand again plays the role of the ditzy female, an unfortunate throwback to gender stereotypes. There was at least one plot hole; the Enterprise should have reached out to the crew after they lost their communicators, rather than just ignoring them for several days.But these are relatively minor complaints. This was a thoughtful episode in which McCoy and Spock worked together, fairly harmoniously, for once, to solve a pressing scientific problem. Kirk managed to use his charm and oratory to get through to the kids in time, without having to resort to any real violence. And that last line was great- ""I never get involved with older women.""The one aspect of this episode that I thought should have been clarified was the status of the kids: if the vaccine worked, shouldn't it have altered their metabolisms back to normal levels? That would solve the problem of ""what do we do with kids who take centuries to grow up?"" and also would eliminate the practicality of the 'fountain of youth' technology, which, if workable, would obviously have profound implications for society.In this era of molecular biology, the prospect of slowed or even halted aging is no longer inconceivable; however, it may come too late for some of us, unfortunately.",8

Mr. Spock seems to be the only one immune but as he clearly states he's still a carrier and wants to get back to the ship. To make matters worse Miri is entering puberty and starts to have feelings for Kirk... she is also jealous over Janis Rand. She wants to help the captain and crew, to find a cure but she is scared and jealous. Can Kirk find the rest of the kids get their help along with Miri? Can Dr. McCoy find a cure before it's too late? If you want to see some very bratty and crazy kids... then this episode is full of them. Rather interesting episode how it all plays out.8/10",8

0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Dagger of the Mind (TV Episode 1966)",The Doctor will Neutralize Your Brain Now,"This episode deals with the future of penal colonies and treatment of unstable criminals. Though supposedly such places are much better run in the 23rd century, Dr. McCoy obviously feels we are still far from Utopian with such 'cages' still in existence - but he doesn't offer better solutions. An escape from such a colony triggers a routine investigation by Kirk based on vague doubts by McCoy about how the famous Dr. Adams (Gregory) runs the place. Once again, as in ""What Are Little Girls Are Made Of?,"" a starship captain enters the lion's den on his own, with no back-up, except for a female assistant. Unlike that other episode, where the famous Dr. Korby was driven to lunacy by extreme circumstances, no real explanation is given for Dr. Adams' sudden shift to mad experimentation. Early in the episode, it's established that he's a well-known benefactor in the field of penology and psychiatric medicine, accomplishing more in his lifetime than all of mankind previously in these fields. Was he just fooling everyone up until now, hiding such extreme sadistic tendencies as he puts on display in this episode? He comes across as someone on a childish power trip by the 4th act, but there seems to be no motive for this supposedly great man to behave this way.Gregory is a fine actor and does what he can with a seemingly truncated role, but the one to watch again is Shatner as Kirk. He's the one who defends Adams while debating with McCoy, almost indicating a kind of hero worship for a man who has made great advances in his field. But once down in the underground colony, his detective instincts take over and Adams is now a target. Kirk proves to be very adept at studying human behavior, more so than his expert assistant, and almost immediately something doesn't smell right to him. He's probably convinced when Adams attempts to avoid the room where the Neural Neutralizer is located - Adams is smooth, but against Kirk he has no chance. Also on hand is actor Woodward as Van Gelder, the one driven insane by the mind sapping device; to say his performance is intense is putting it mildly. The actor showed up again in the role of a starship captain in the 2nd season's ""Omega Glory."" This episode will go down in history (or has already) as the first one with Spock using a Vulcan mind meld (on Van Gelder). It's a testament to Nimoy's acting ability that he infuses such mystique and focus into a scene which could have been sappy & trite. There's also a great scene of Kirk going insane in the little torture room, his crazed laughter signaling the end of an act - it's kind of scary and the audience may think he's permanently damaged going into a commercial break, because we've already seen the loopy Van Gelder. Otherwise, it's another one of those missions which wasn't really a mission, a case which may have been better suited to Starfleet's special investigations unit and is therefore a bit beneath someone who should be exploring the galaxy, looking for new lifeforms.",7
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Dagger of the Mind (TV Episode 1966)",The Vulcan mind meld,"Dagger of the Mind has everything one would expect from a good Star Trek episode: suspense, great dialogue and a subtle reflection on a contemporary issue, in this case the medical treatment of insane people.The Enterprise is orbiting around a planet that serves as a prison colony, specifically designed for the criminally insane. When an inmate manages to get on the ship, Spock and McCoy do everything in their power to capture him, while Kirk and the crew's psychiatrist, a woman with whom - what a surprise - he appears to have a history, beam down to the planet to talk to Dr. Adams, whose revolutionary discoveries are well known throughout the galaxy. The truth, it turns out, is rather different from what they thought: the escaped convict is actually someone who used to work at the facility, and has been driven mad by Adams' latest creation, a device that allows him to control the human mind. And now, in order to protect his secret, the doctor intends to use it on Kirk.The episode originally aired at a time when psychiatric hospitals and various forms of treatment for mentally ill patients were still a controversial subject (Frederick Wiseman's harrowing documentary Titicut Follies, which was banned for its explicit look at what goes on in a ""mad house"", was released in 1967), and so the writers used the excuse of Trek being nothing but an average sci-fi show - which Gene Roddenberry always stressed it wasn't, and still isn't - to get away with their own look at the issue, hidden under the usual mix of thrills and wit.Fans also remember Dagger of the Mind fondly because it introduces the famous Vulcan ""mind meld"", which is essentially a form of telepathy used by Spock to get information when all other methods have failed. It adds a lot to the alien nature of the character, and went on to become a recurring element throughout the series. An iconic moment, and undoubtedly one of Leonard Nimoy's best on the show.",9
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Dagger of the Mind (TV Episode 1966)",Nice to See Marianna Hill again,"I rather liked this episode for the particularly fact that actress Hill appears in it, in a rather strong, fluctuate role as Dr. Helen Mirren; psychologist. I have always loved Marianna Hill's work, especially in many of the 60's and early 70's films and TV appearances she's endured, including co-starring with Clint Eastwood in 'High Plains Drifter'.Hill is remarkably well-done in this one-time episode. In a few scenes she appears slightly apprehensive, almost insecure, far as her abilities as an actress. But nonetheless, she is a great screen beauty, and as fine an actress as any. I especially appreciate that Roddenberry did not subject her character -Mirren- to the typical fawn-femme typecast, as was generally typical of Star Trek women (aka: Kirk's ladies). Her character is independent, strong, and viral. She, and including in her character, holds her own throughout the episode, and displays some of the strongest of female subject, not usually common, for 1960's television.",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Dagger of the Mind (TV Episode 1966)",The Manchurian Psychiatrist,"Morgan Woodward enters Trek here as an apparent Psychotic escapee from a 23rd Century Insane Asylum.But he is not what he appears. Was this episode based on The Manchurian Candidate? It has many things that are also in that film, mainly brainwashing, personality changing, but most important, James Gregory, who played ""Senator John Iselin"" as Dr. Tristan Adams.Of course, because of Morgan Woodward's character's status, Kirk has to make an inspection of Adam's Clinic. With a ""Dr Helen Noel"" in tow.And this is where one disturbing scene plays out: As Kirk and Dr. Noel (The Magnificent Marianna Hill) share a toast with Adams, he has this to say:""To all mankind, may we never find space so vast, planets so cold, heart and mind so empty that... that we cannot fill them with love and warmth.""And as that word ""Empty"" is used, the camera looks on to Adam's Assistant, ""Lethe"" (Susanne Wasson) who looks on with the most utterly blank of expressions. And ""Lethe"" means either a River in hell that can make you forget, or, the Act of Forgetting in itself. Or ""Emptyness"". Dr Adams is perverting his field, by using a machine intended to cause relief from painful memories, and inserting painful memories.And now, he's got Kirk, who made the mishap of spending the night in the Arkham Asylum of Space and not locking doors to rooms he was looking at. And the ""chair"" Kirk finds has added significance in the episode ""Whom Gods Destroy"", where when used as intended it becomes a tool of healing for another iconic character.But I want to go back and mention the genius of Morgan Woodward's ""Psycho"", his portrayal was exactly as a person victimized by this invasive procedure would be. And it is also the first time Mr. Spock's Vulcanian ""Mind Meld"" is shown.I find that the recent ""Star Trek Discovery"" episode ""Lethe"" directly relates to this episode, not just by the name of one character related to the title of that episode, but by the similar mental manipulations that had been done in that show. where the character ""Ash Tyler"" had been manipulated by the Klingon named L'Rell.",10

There are some, I will say, 'continuity' issues with the episode. As far as I know, and I'm just a fan and not a critic, this is the only episode with this problem. Maybe it was just the editing for TV. . . but it seems as if scenes that would have better explained the action were never filmed. Or as if scenes explaining the plot and action were edited out.

5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Dagger of the Mind (TV Episode 1966)",Star Trek The Original Series--Dagger of the Mind,"Dr. Simon van Gelder (Morgan Woodward) escapes a penal colony on board the Enterprise by way of a cargo box transported from the planet. He seems to be a mad, violent escaped lunatic who could leave a body count on the ship but there's a definite motivation in his actions, making it to the bridge, having taken a phaser from an officer, and demanding asylum from Captain Kirk. After being subdued by the Vulcan neck pinch from Spock, McCoy wants to examine van Gelder, once a renowned psychiatric doc, now reduced to a barely-coherent, tortured mind. When van Gelder attempts to speak he can only give a few bits of information before bouts with horrible pain anguish him into a physical wreck. McCoy will appeal to Spock to use the ancient Vulcan mind meld technique to probe van Gelder's tormented mind for answers. Meanwhile, Kirk, reluctant but carrying out the duty of his position when McCoy states in his medical log doubts in regards to the techniques used by the distinguished Dr. Tristan Adams (James Gregory; The Manchurian Candidate), transports, with an officer recommended by Bones due to her field in psychiatry, with Dr. Helen Noel (Marianna Hill; High Plains Drifter / Blood Beach) to the penal colony to ""investigate"" the methods used on the patients. Discovered by Spock and McCoy during the mind meld, a machine is mentioned by van Gelder--Kirk is interested in its effectiveness when he visits it while on his tour and wants Noel to guide him through how it operates, with Adams using it on him because of the threat the Captain poses to his secret misbehavior--describing it as a neural neutralizer. Adams, it is soon realized, is responsible for using the machine to wipe the minds of his patients, replacing his own thoughts and commands, such methods giving him quite the power to influence anyone he so chooses. Kirk will need Noel to shut down the power while Adams forcibly uses the mind sucking machine to further torture the Captain. If the power is shut down, Spock and security can beam down because the penal colony has a forcefield that disrupts transportation. Woodward certainly convinces as someone mentally enduring some serious pain, showing it on his face and providing the bodily suffering that might result in resisting Adams' control. Gregory puts on quite a face of total collaboration with Kirk in regards to how tip top his operations are, so willing to allow total scrutinized study of his work in the rehabilitation of his patients and the living conditions produced by his treatment. It doesn't come as no surprise that he's actually an evil bastard raping the minds and thoughts of people that fall prey to his dastardly machine (the way it sounds and rotates, and the agonizing cries of those who sit in the chair, this machine is a beast), because Gregory plays him as someone with a smile on his face and a dagger (pun intended) clamped in a fist like grip behind his back ready to stab. The mind meld itself is fascinating to watch: Spock almost seems to be in a state of ecstatic bliss while clutching the surrounding face and forehead of Woodward, who is actually calm and in complete peace while under this Vulcan probe. That final scene where Kirk sits in his Captain's chair, looking at the planet he barely escaped with his sanity intact, his face totally aware of what his mind had just been through, certainly explains a lot of what it might be like to endure such a hardship. The scene where Gregory gets more than a taste of his own medicine, but without the person on the other side providing his own thoughts, totally alone to be mind sucked into his own oblivion, is a fitting end to him for what he done to those under his care.",8

If you think about the outlandish plot, then you'll probably hate the show, as there really is no conceivable reason why James Gregory turned this prison into his own personal Hell. It just didn't make any sense, but on a purely non-aesthetic level, it sure was fun to watch--mostly so you can see Kirk tortured into loving his very hot female crew member who accompanied him on the mission. I also liked seeing Dr. Simon van Gelder run about and act like a mad man--this must have been a very fun role for Morgan Woodward. Also, I gotta admit that the ending involving Gregory in the chair was so brilliantly written and powerful. Not a great episode, but one well worth watching since it's anything but boring.BY THE WAY--I recently watched the schlocky 1950s film BRIDE OF THE GORILLA and was surprised to see one of the characters was named ""Dr. Van Gelder""--the same name as the crazed doctor who stows away on the Enterprise at the beginning of this episode! Obviously someone was having a cute little inside joke!Also, this episode ushered in two firsts. Spock uses the mind meld and Kirk shows that he has a sex drive!! Apart from the evil Kirk (when he was divided into an aggressive and passive copy), he was always married to his ship in earlier shows. Here he shows that MAYBE he might like girls. This would be shown to DEFINITELY be the case in subsequent shows as well as the second Trek movie!!",8

I have owned the original series on video and DVD and have watched every episode at least half a dozen times (in some cases a lot more). Up until now I have always considered this one of the weaker episodes from season 1 (there's not a lot of action), but I recently upgraded to blu ray and having re-watched it (with the enhanced special effects which despite my concerns don't actually spoil the ""feel"" of the episodes) I've changed my mind. The story is actually really well done and the acting pretty good too, and we get to see the first use of the Vulcan mind meld. But the main reason I have changed my mind is Marianna Hill. Not only is she a really good actress, but her character Dr. Helen Noel is one of the few female characters within TOS written in such a way to make Captain Kirk feel uncomfortable. The interaction between her and William Shatner in the transporter room is actually really amusing, I had never really thought about it before but I'd love to know what was supposed to have happened at that Christmas party. Admittedly as the story acts out she eventually becomes Kirk's ""love interest of the week"" but that initial scene has now become one of my favourite scenes within the whole series. It's never going to make it in to my top 10 list as there are too many better episodes, but that short scene has definitely made it much more enjoyable.",8

I remember reading a Sherlock Holmes story in which he observed that ""when a doctor goes wrong, he is the first of criminals"", and as this episode unfolded I could see one such glaring example. When the deranged Simon van Gelder exploded onto the bridge of the Enterprise and it was found that he was, not an inmate, but an associate of Dr. Adams who had been victimized by the ""neural neutralizer"", an investigation was imperative. The key to the whole thing was one of the most dramatic scenes in the history of Trek---the first use of the Vulcan mind-meld on a human---and a lot of credit has to go to Dr. McCoy, who for all that he called himself an old-fashioned country doctor was light-years ahead of everyone else; he was the one who pushed the reluctant Vulcan with the urgent ""Will it work---or not?"" Spock actually performed what I immediately recognized as a quieter version of the Vulcan mind-fusion combined with telepathic hypnosis (and Leonard Nimoy really pulled a fast one on the network censors!); he delivered two quiet, half-whispered suggestions of well-being, relaxation and of weightless suspension, which exerted a calming effect on van Gelder's mind and enabled him to describe his ordeal. And eventually the now-deranged Dr. Adams fell victim to his own nefarious machinations, while van Gelder was restored to sanity by the same Vulcan mind-fusion and took over the direction of the penal colony. +As I watched Spock in action I started to get a new appreciation of what the Vulcans call ""wuh tepul t'wuh kashek""---the power of the mind and what it could be capable of. And I recognized the truth of the Sherlock Holmes observation.",10

The man in charge of the place, however, has been conducting unethical and tortuous experiments on patients, and decides now it's Kirk's turn.This one is not particularly cheesy or goofy. In fact, the premise of a doctor using an isolated institution as his own personal laboratory holds plenty of promise. But in this episode character and plot are handled in an indifferent manner.For starters, Dr. Van Gelder's rampage on the Enterprise takes too long and fills up time with meaningless running around that could have been spent developing the main plot. Then, the character of Dr. Adams in completely undeveloped: what is he up to and why? What are his motives? His world view? Why bother subjecting Kirk to his machine when he can simply entertain him and let him go without Kirk ever finding out what Adams is up to? We don't know, the episode does not tell us, and consequently we don't care about what he does next.Nothing about the plot of developed adequately. Apparently the institution consists of vegged-out followers of Dr. Adams, but we only get that when Kirk mentions it in one line of dialogue, then it's never mentioned again. It's certainly never shown to us for any dramatic effect.A episode of TOS can be cheesy and still be fun to watch. But it should never, never be as indifferently constructed as this.There are two good things, though: Morgan Woodward certainly gives an energetic performance as Dr. Van Gelder, even though the character gets senselessly dropped by episode's end.

He is from a penal colony and at first the people aboard the Enterprise think that he is one of the convicts. He is stark raving mad.It turns out that Dr. Tristan Adams is responsible for Dr. Van Gelder's lunacy. He has been using a machine called the neural neutralizer which makes the inmates quite docile and subdued. However, he went overboard with the machine when he was using it on Dr. Van Gelder. The issues I have with this episode are: 1) Dr. Adams is supposed to be the foremost Dr. in the criminal field and is supposedly responsible for helping to make penal colonies more humane and the inmates less violent. However, he eventually appears to be mad with power and is quite sadistic. It never explains how he ended up this way or if somehow he has always been like that and it just never was exposed. 2) Kirk goes down the to colony and discovers the machine which is out in the open and suddenly, Dr. Adams decides that he has to use this on Kirk. Why not just keep the room closed so no one on the outside sees it. And why go to that extreme with Kirk. He could easily have just made pleasant suggestions to Kirk who would have believed it and then left none the wiser. 3) Dr. Van Gelder is so out of his mind through most of the show. But, when everything is finally resolved, he is back on the penal colony and he is apparently fine. How is he suddenly fine after what he went through. 4) Dr. Adams is subjected to the machine by accident when no one is around and because of that he ends up dead. I do not see how that can happen. The excuse is because he died of loneliness. I don't think that is what the outcome would be. I think he would just be completely docile and very suggestible.",7

It contains a man who initially appears to be one of the inmates; he certainly appears to be dangerous. It soon emerges that he was actually Dr. Simon van Gelder, one of the doctors stationed there, but he finds it impossible to go into details as to what happened. Returning to Tantalus V, Kirk and psychiatrist Lt. Helen Noel beam down to the planet and the institute's director, Dr. Tristan Adams, explains that van Gelder had exposed himself to a radical treatment, the Neural Neutralizer that had damaged his mind. This device is used to remove certain memories while implanting others; Kirk decides to try the machine himself while Dr Noel inputs some harmless suggestions; their session is interrupted by Dr Adams and he is soon putting other thoughts into Kirk's head. Realising that Adams is dangerous Kirk and Noel work to find a way to lower the force field that protects the facility before Adams can do more damage. Meanwhile on the Enterprise Spock learns what happened to van Gelder after performing a mind meld.This episode gets off to a good start; Morgan Woodward does a solid job as van Gelder; when we first see him he appears to be a swivel-eyed loon, we are clearly meant to think of him as a dangerous threat. The more we get to know about the character the more sympathetic he becomes. Equally James Gregory comes across as reliable in the role of Dr Adams; a character with all the right answers who does little that is suspicious until the point he subjects Kirk to the Neural Neutralizer. The idea of this device is both simply and frightening; the idea of having ones thoughts and memories easily manipulated is a little scary. Marianna Hill does a good job as Dr Noel even if the character is a bit cliché at first; she does better later on when she dispatches one of Adams' goons in shocking style. The story is well told for the most part although it would have been better if we'd been given a greater insight into why Adams was going what he was.",7
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Dagger of the Mind (TV Episode 1966)",One of the better of season 1. Producers made a play for the Gunsmoke fandom.,"This is one of my more favored episodes of the series. Morgan Woodward gave an excellent performance as a tortured mind escaped from the penal camp. James Gregory turned in a nice performance as the sadistic doctor that has been corrupted by his power over the patients. Marianna Hill was great eye candy although they didn't give her the lines to portray a credible doctor of psychiatry. At least she got to show off her chops in Godfather II years later. Her romantic interest with Kirk gave the show a few humorous points but the kisses between her and Shatner seemed so forced. Nimoy and Kelley turned in some excellent performances. This episode is where they finally started fleshing out Vulcan culture with the introduction of the Mind Meld. The scene where McKoy comes onto the bridge and expresses his doubts about Adam's version of Van Geldar's escape deepens McKoys character.This plot is more like the theme of Star Trek that future incarnations would adhere too. A future society that has advanced methods and technology to treat age-old problems in a new way but sometimes with disastrous consequences. There were fewer plot holes and failures of basic science in this episode than many. It was well written to place a penal/mental health facility for dangerous offenders miles below the surface of a gas giant with an unbreathable atmosphere covered in a shield and only escapable by transporter. Still a man half crazed figured a way out... Maybe they shouldn't put central air conditioning ducts in a penal colony without bars or force fields every few meters? In room only climate controls? A machine that can remove memories from a brain is a fantastic discovery and I'm sure people would pay dearly to access it. Too bad the writers concluded it was 'evil' instead of just concluding that the person using it needs to be overseen by several colleagues and an AI assistant. While I don't believe in psychic phenomena and found the Mind Meld to be more fantasy than science it is great drama and part of the Star Trek universe. It got off to a great start in the scene between Nimoy and Woodward.Morgan Woodward was a hook from the producers to the Gunsmoke crowd to sit down and watch this new fangled Star Trek. James Gregory also was a regular on Gun Smoke, Bonanza and The Big Valley and I remember my father sitting down to watch Star Trek being drawn in by the familiar faces from some of his favorite TV Westerns. He didn't watch for long because it wasn't really cowboys in space so I watched in reruns in the '70's.Anyone that hasn't seen the remastered episodes they are cleaned up nicely and I have never seen TOS in this clarity before. The TV was always too fuzzy and the shows had lines and flecks of hairs or dust in the broadcast episodes from years of playing. The opening scene with the Enterprise over the penal colony planet is breath taking.",8
16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Dagger of the Mind (TV Episode 1966)",Definitely one of the better episodes,"I enjoyed this one, the woman psychiatrist was not in one of those over-sexed costumes. When she kicked one of the guards on the penal colony into the high-voltage line and electrocuted him, Capt. Kirk wasn't the only hero for once. The man who played the escaped penal colony con was excellent at his portrayal of a tortured mind. Intense!!! One of the better-written episodes.",9
17,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Dagger of the Mind (TV Episode 1966)",Kinda lingers,"I disagree with other reviewers who say this is a rubbish story - it's inspired and inspiring: - both The Avengers (Who's Who, 6/5/67) and The Prisoner (Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling, 7/1/68) adopt and adapt this premise and base their stories around it. The casting is superb but 33% predictable - when you see James Gregory in the cast list you know he will be playing a dude who will f..k your mind or any part of you to earn an outer space dollar or half a kelligram of outer space kudos - and so it seems here, he having invented a rather unattractive (even by 1960s decor standards) ceiling lamp which can not just lobotomise his subjects without the need for invasive surgery; but implant his own psyche into their brains - it could be called a ""mind bonk"" - but I'm sure Dr Adams (James Gregory) would call it ""mind love"" and could justify his actions to the highest court of all. Naturally - and obviously - James Tiberius Kirk's mind is sufficiently powerful to resist the mind bonk - and predictably he does so here - as we his audience must know he will. All told then, a supreme episode - spoiled only by Morgan Woodward's entrance - far better to have the crate from which he emerges hinged at the back giving a cartoon effect as he emerges? - any which way up the dozy transporter operator would be none the wiser as his back was turned. And as another rewiever has commented, let us not forget this episode's guest babe is the lovely Marianna Hill (check her out nude in the film El Condor) - in a skirt so short she shows her knickers while remaining perpendicular - then descending at high speed in a lift with Kirk where he comments on the intimacy of their previous tryst with: ""It's a long way down!"" Easily on a par with Celeste Yarnall in The Apple and the girls in Spock's Brain; but for my money Nurse Christine Chapel is Star Trek's best mini skirt babe: she doesn't know how lovely she is - but she wears her mini skirt uniform because she has to - and she looks lovely in it - so she gets my vote as best Star Trek mini skirt girl.",8
18,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Dagger of the Mind (TV Episode 1966)",Not too bad but paints an unrealistically ugly picture of psychiatry,"I thought this episode was reasonably well done but badly marred by its rather starkly negative portrayal of psychiatry. The most 'renowned' psychiatrist of all time, Adams, turns out to be a slick and rather vicious man who seems to enjoy 'playing' with and abusing the minds of others. Kirk's ""expert"" psychiatric assistant, Dr. Helen Noel, turns out to be almost willfully ignorant and more hindrance than help for the most part. A slightly more balanced perspective on psychiatry would have been much preferable; not every psychiatrist had to be portrayed as either corrupt, or incompetent. But maybe that's too much to expect from a TV series, even one like Star Trek.For someone who Kirk almost seems reverential toward, Adams is strikingly stupid here, in that he leaves the 'neural neutralizer' room open to see for anyone who visits the facility. All he had to do was place the device in an isolated and concealed room and Kirk probably wouldn't have learned a thing.McCoy's instincts turn out to be right, here. Kirk is forced to investigate only because of McCoy's actions. Spock, while skeptical at first, nevertheless helps McCoy's investigation by performing the series' first Vulcan mind-meld. Both officers come off a bit better than the rather credulous Kirk.Dr. Noel (Marianna Hill) doesn't fare too well either, here, being rather worthless as a psychiatrist, but did have one decent moment when she kicks the henchman at the end at a critical moment. But her character is a bit of an embarrassment otherwise, functioning primarily as Kirk's eye candy of the week. The episode would have been much more interesting IMO if she, rather than Kirk, had been the suspicious one calling for a closer investigation, once they were at the facility, especially since Kirk had been so resistant to investigating at all, in the first place, while she was supposed to be the 'expert', not him. I kind of wonder if Shatner had something to do with that.",4

When the escapee turns out to be a former colleague of said doctor, Kirk must head to the prison to get to the bottom of what's really going on.While I really enjoy the idea of this episode, the story never really feels complete. We never truly discover Dr. Adams' motivation as to why he's doing what he's doing. For the good of science? For the prison? Or is he just insane? The episode never makes this clear. I do like that in the future, prisons are no longer built in the same fashion as they are today. This seems very futuristic for the show. Morgan Woodward's performance is another highlight; his spastic portrayal as Dr. van Gelder is entertaining to watch and brings life to his scenes. Shatner is also particularly good in this episode. Besides the rhetoric relating to imprisonment, this episode delves into forced mental rehabilitation and brainwashing... heavy stuff.If I could rewrite the script, I think I'd shorten the escape scene of Dr. van Gelder and focus more on Adams and why he's doing this to his test subjects. I think this would cause a more satisfying conclusion.",7
20,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Dagger of the Mind (TV Episode 1966)",Where Minds Get Blown Away,"With guest star James Gregory (the Inspector on Barney Miller) to add with the regular cast of this series, this episode has plenty of talent. The theme of the Enterprise encountering a prison planet for the first time would actually be reused later in the series ""Enterprise"". In this one Gregory is the bad guy as he is basically blowing away minds on this prison planet and molding them to his behavior.When the Enterprise beams up an escapee who was supposed to be Gregory's right hand but instead appears for some reason to have gone nuts in 6 months on the planet, Kirk decides he has to investigate what is going on. Spock and McCoy puzzled by the mental problems begin an investigation of the escapee which eventually leads to the first use of Spocks Mind Meld.Kirk puts his mind on the line by encountering the neutralizer machine taking an early chance on getting his mind melted. I watched this with the enhanced special effects on the blue ray set of the first season on DVD. It is a decent episode which one again has small reminders to me of the top series on CBS when this was aired. Kirk's heroic putting of himself in harms way is very much the type of hero that James West was doing on CBS.The Sci-Fi here is punctuated with action though not as much as The Wild Wild West, but the underground caverns and the crawling through the ducts by Dr Noel to save Kirk are very much the same type of themes as the CBS series was using.",7
21,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Dagger of the Mind (TV Episode 1966)","""Welcome to Devil's Island, Doctor"".","Watching Star Trek episodes in their original air date order makes for some interesting viewing. You get to catch a lot of 'firsts', such as Spock's yet unnamed Vulcan mind meld that others on this board have already referenced. In this story you also get Roddenberry's testing the waters for which direction he might want to take Captain Kirk's libido in future episodes. Even though the Captain was under the influence of Van Gelder's (James Gregory) neural neutralizer, his scene attempting to seduce Helen Noel (Marianna Hill) was still played for romantic effect, even if the doctor turned into an unwilling participant. I would like to have been a fly on the wall at that Science Lab Christmas Party though.What I enjoyed most however was seeing how the principal characters really began to take shape and develop their relationship with each other here. It was rather bold of McCoy to challenge Kirk by going on the record with his medical observation of Dr. Adams' (James Gregory) methods. Then you had Spock shedding more insight into his Vulcan heritage - ""Where there's no emotion, there's no motive for violence"".Curiously, the planetary scene where Kirk and Noel first beamed down to the Tantalus Colony had already been used in the series' third episode 'Where No Man Has Gone Before'. That surprised me a bit since it was still early in the show's history; so much for that tag line. Considering that the show's budget offered some really cheesy landscapes is probably a tip off that they weren't going to spend a lot of money at this stage of the game. Even some of the effects on board the Enterprise looked bare bones in terms of design. But I guess that's all part of the nostalgic feel one comes to acquire for the series after four decades.",8
22,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Dagger of the Mind (TV Episode 1966)",touch the wrong line..,"Star Trek Dagger Of The MindA cultural hub and by far one of the most loved and respected tale, Star Trek is created by Gene Roddenberry who wrote this brilliant concept, ahead of its time and is probably why it still doesn't fail to entertain us after these many years. It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. Unlike any other hit series, it only has 3 seasons so luckily it means that they will be covering up all their ideas within it until they are satisfied. As it often happens, the first season is always promising and has potential (or else it won't lift up for further more seasons) in it and is utilized with fine detailed work like focusing on different new breeds and characters bonding through this journey.As mentioned earlier, some loose threads while executing such eerie script at the time is negotiable but such big flaws are utterly inedible. The concept was new and intriguing but the soul reason was the same and the urgency or the critical danger isn't expressed with conviction in here.",
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Corbomite Maneuver (TV Episode 1966)","When All Else Fails, Bluff Your Way Out Kirk-style","Technically the first episode filmed after the 2nd pilot, ""Where No Man Has Gone Before,"" this comes across as almost experimental, a dry run for the rest of the first season. You see rarely seen angles, such as from behind Kirk as he exits the turbolift onto the bridge. Though overall the episode comes across as not very eventful by the standards of most Trek episodes, its strengths are showcasing various crew members and their reactions to the presumed threat they face. Exploration is the key factor, as will be usual: the Enterprise is in an unknown sector of space and suddenly blocked by some revolving cube device. Forced to destroy this after it starts emitting radiation, Kirk now faces a choice or path - proceed further to face possible other dangers or turn around. We get a case study of how starship captains earn their pay - the buck seems to stop with him and his next decision could have long reaching ramifications. Within the possibilities of exploration, the theme here is the unknown: how do we, as a species, face it? Do we go on, advance, taking that risk, or do we stop and perhaps stagnate?But despite grandiose ideas about mankind's future in exploring the galaxy, it boils down to the human equation of how men & women react and interact aboard such a ship. Guest star Call is excellent as the young navigator whom Kirk perhaps promoted too quickly. His nervous breakdown on the bridge is beautifully played. Then McCoy & Kirk get into it as the ship and crew have maybe three minutes of life to go, arguing over the distressed crewman. Even Spock seems uneasy as he fails to find an alternative for the now edgy Kirk, again a well-acted scene. It comes across as very true-to-life, a realistic study of people under tremendous pressure. Kirk's tactic of bluffing a far superior enemy shows, in the first of many such instances in the series, just how quickly and cannily Kirk thinks on his feet and why he is captain. No one aboard, including Spock (who prefers chess to poker) would have come up with such a play. That all being said, this episode is probably best remembered for that long shot of the colossal ship Fesarius approaching the Enterprise. With some of the best dramatic Trek score blaring away at us, it still gives me goose bumps.",7
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Corbomite Maneuver (TV Episode 1966)",How to deal with an intergalactic bully,"The Corbomite Maneouver does a couple of things really well. It is easily one of Star Trek TOS' most dramatic and suspenseful episodes. It also provides the first really good character study for James Kirk in the series - establishing Kirk as the one man who will always find a creative solution for even the impossible situation.The Enterprise encounters a very highly technologically advanced alien culture in deep space. Their first encounter occurs when Enterprise meets up with a buoy that gives off harmful radiation and simply will not go away. They destroy the buoy and are then confronted by its makers The First Federation - belligerent, unforgiving, and all-powerful. Kirk must think his way out of this one.The Corbomite Maneouver is also one of the most visually interesting TOS episodes. The special effects, as simple as they are, are well done. And the directing is some of the best in the series.",9

But there are also script elements that elevate this episode above others in the series. As the episode opens, we hear ""Dave Bailey"" carping about how bored and fatigued he is after three long days of ""star charting"". This brilliant line shows us that between ""adventures"", the Enterprise and its crew are actually doing something productive! Another element is the phaser drills that Kirk has the crew run. Once again, they are keeping busy. Also notice the constant background chatter over the intercom system (a feature that would slowly disappear as the seasons progressed). With this episode, one gets the feeling that this is a ""working"" vessel and crew (as opposed to nothing but plywood sets) - aspects that would be completely lost by the third season.",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Corbomite Maneuver (TV Episode 1966)",My Favorite TOS Episode,"This episode may make some Trekkers' Top 20 lists, but likely not many Top Tens. Yet quietly and without fuss this ""bottle show"" episode remains perfectly indicative of TOS's purpose, spirit and delivery.Think Murray Leinster's classic sci-fi short story ""First Contact"" with an additional plot twist, possibly two. A scriptwriter or editor who may have had Uhura say the same line a tad too often and missed ""adrenaline gland"" but had to have served in the Navy, knew the true meaning of ""countermand,"" and wasn't afraid to ask, ""What are you going to do with that six percent when they give it to you, Jim?""Add Joseph Sargent's direction, Fred Steiner's music, Gerald Perry Finnerman and his color gels, Anthony Call's laser-accurate performance complemented by that of the core ensemble, Clint Howard's eyebrows and dubbing, and Ted Cassidy's voice of authority as only he could deliver. Splendid sound effects and their editing, which offset the visual effects, though the physically infeasible appearance of the alien mother ship got the point across very nicely. And an ending that made me smile as a youngster, and does so today.And Now I Digress, Somewhat: I often feel compelled to explain to today's ""post-next generation"" sated with digital effects and compulsory cheesecake just how TOS had its impact, my having watched its world premiere and nearly every episode at first broadcast. And I'm saddened to see TOS and its actors parodied today, much less by the actors themselves.Friends, when TOS premiered ""In Living Color!"" its only competition was Irwin Allen's ""running and jumping shows,"" which had as much science as a peanut butter sandwich left out in the double sun too long. The Outer Limits (in black-and-white!) had run its course after only two seasons, and not even the revered Rod Serling would attempt the genre on the 'tube with recurring characters.We readers of Asimov, Bradbury, Clarke, Heinlein, Sturgeon and the other masters of the genre (okay, Harlan Ellison, we know you must scream, so you can count yourself) climbed down our trees and praised The Great Bird of the Galaxy for making the 'tube finally listen and display something hopeful to talk about before we finally caught up with our own imaginations on the moon.The actors had chops, if the scripts couldn't make you feel they could make you THINK, the characters grew to make you care, and not one scantily-clad beauty was the token she first seemed if you were young enough to be allowed to watch. Wondrous times indeed.So start with this episode, or return to it as you would an old friend, and from there go back and forth to your heart's content. Long live Balok, and pass the tranya!",8
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Corbomite Maneuver (TV Episode 1966)","""A very interesting game, this poker"".","I've always remembered this episode as the one in which Captain Kirk had to quickly think on his feet in order to save the Enterprise with only a ten minute warning. The countdown actually got pretty low before Spock inadvertently hinted a solution to Kirk with his chess reference, triggering the Captain's thoughts to a more formidable game of bluff. It was a very cool resolution for Kirk to challenge Balok with his corbomite maneuver while puzzling the crew with what seemed like a top secret plan that no one else knew anything about. It showed just how deft the Captain could be when the fate of the entire Enterprise was put on the line.Watching these shows again in original air date order, it's interesting to see Dr. McCoy challenge Kirk in his medical records twice in a row; he had done so in the prior episode, ""Dagger of the Mind"" as well. Just that idea showed how far Gene Roddenberry and his writers had developed the concept of a highly disciplined structure in which a United Earth Ship had to operate. On the flip side however, it looks almost comical for them to have goofed on a simple idea like the countdown clock flipping to 1:59 with a minute left to respond to Balok.But this was Kirk at his best, making an impossible decision with a coolness of character matched only by Spock in this and future episodes. If I'm not mistaken, this was the first time Spock used his signature line - ""Fascinating"". And a first for Bones as well, uttering one of his many to come comparisons when asked to perform outside of his regular duties - ""What am I, a doctor or a moon shuttle coordinator""?",8

Of especial note is the score, Star Trek is known for its wonderful compositions (from the TV series to the movies) and this episode isn't any different - indeed, Fred Steiner composed a classic score.",
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Corbomite Maneuver (TV Episode 1966)",Beautifully scripted and acted moments,"It is too easy to miss the superb moments in this episode. For me the greatest highlight out of several is the relatively long (ten minutes according to the script) countdown to destruction sequence. When faced with the threat of total annihilation from Balok, Kirk proves his mettle as a starship commander by his calm pronouncements, providing the leadership qualities required to keep the apparently doomed crew focused on their duties. But as the clock ticks down to disaster, the young officer Bailey starts to crack and does so in the most convincing manner when triggered by the apparent futility of Sulu's announcement of the time. This scene is superbly well acted by Anthony Call, as other reviewers have noted. Bravo to him and a personal Lifetime Acting Star from me for a really great performance. As for the others on the bridge, I could almost feel the greater experience of the older crew keeping them in line whilst the inexperienced Bailey disintegrates under the strain. I could also feel the strong compassion in McCoy as he escorts the by now devastated Bailey off the bridge. Marvellous acting from DeForrest Kelley in this episode.These early episodes of Star Trek retain their dramatic power on repeated viewing, principally because of the great acting and scripts, combined with music that is really cut to the cloth of the drama so well. I think the great variety of musical atmosphere in the original Star Trek series is one of several reasons for the enduring appeal of the series. I have often thought that later generations of Star Trek tended to use background music far too flippantly, almost like Musak, as a cover for mediocre scenes. There are great moments of silence in the Corbomite Maneuver which add immensely to the dramatic effect, with background starship chatter adding to the effect, again as noted by other reviewers. Simply a superb episode.",10
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Corbomite Maneuver (TV Episode 1966)",Kirk's genius,"Like many other Star Trek episodes, The Corbomite Maneuver is a good exploration of an essential 20th century theme such as the futility of war, with the addition of a riveting portrait of what makes a commander worthy of the title, as seen in the episode's depiction of Captain Kirk's skills.Once again, danger lies ahead as the Enterprise continues on its five-year mission. This time it's more serious than usual, since the mysterious alien attacker claims to be able to destroy the ship with no risk of anything stopping him, and therefore grants the crew ten minutes to pray or something to that effect. Of course, he hasn't considered Kirk who, being the stubborn son of a gun he's always been (when Spock points out the two always argue about decisions Kirk won't take back, the latter explains that arguing makes him feel good), threatens the alien by saying he has a device that will annihilate both the Enterprise and its attacker, and he's not afraid to use it. Obviously it's a bluff, but it may come with a price, as Kirk and his opponent engage in a dangerous battle of wits to determine who's more willing to go through with their alleged threats.Whereas most Trek episodes have pretty predictable outcomes, mostly because of the formulaic structure of the scripts, The Corbomite Maneuver is commendable for offering a very neat and intelligent twist that sits well with the episode's overall critique of the political climate of the Cold War (yes, subtlety has never been one of the show's strengths, but NBC didn't care since it was sci-fi). The acting is as inspiring as ever (even William Shatner's much mocked speech patterns come off as more serious than usual), especially Clint Howard's (that's Ron's brother) cameo at the end. Fun, tense and clever.",9
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Corbomite Maneuver (TV Episode 1966)",International Relations 101,"Not so much a Cold War analogy as some Star Trek episodes tended to be, this particular installment of the classic 1960's Star Trek franchise dramatizes the push and pull, the ebb and flow, of two nations coming into conflict with one another, and how the game of denial, deception, and bluff (usually in the form of classic saber rattling) can remand relations to square one.This is the genius of Star Trek. The ability to codify everyday experiences into a dramatized setting for comment. When I first viewed it I understood the underlying message, but not the entire theme and ramifications thereof. It would take another thirty years for me to go ""Ah-HA! I get it now..."" Oh sure, I understood the whole misunderstanding and suspicion thing, but I figured it was story filler. As it turns out, this episode, like nearly all Trek episodes, cleverly illustrates the extension of male oriented interpersonal relations manifested on a national level. A little counter to this high minded philosophizing is the introduction of a character on the bridge who represents the fear and loathing of the common man, and the innate reptile (or inner child) as he follows orders (or his inability thereof). And therein lies a whole other level of meaning above and beyond geo-politics.Production Values; the SFX for 1960s television are what they are; i.e. not always convincing, but able to get their point across. Ditto with one artificial ""alien"", though this is countered by some optical effects and the overall thesping by the cast (including the voice actor for the off-screen dialog). I've not seen the remastered episodes, but, of all the classic Trek that have had their SFX and other production values tweaked for modern visual sensibilities, I'm very interested in seeing this one.Enjoy.",

I was 10 years old when I saw it in first broadcast. It made me feel like I really was flying around the galaxy in a large starship. I most remembered the Enterprise resisting and then successfully breaking free of Balok's tractor beam.Today I see an episode rich in character development, with everyone (except Mr. Bailey, at first) surviving by their wits against a vastly more powerful adversary. Now my favorite moment is the subtle change in Kirk's face when he realizes (thanks to his angry snap at McCoy) that their way out is to change the game they've been playing:""Not chess, Mr. Spock. Poker. Do you know the game?""Followed by Mr. Spock's impressed rejoinder a few minutes later:""A very interesting game, this 'poker'""Given the obvious comic potential, it's really too bad the show never followed through on Dr. McCoy's offer to teach it to Spock.In contrast to the hot-headed and panicky Mr. Bailey, Mr. Sulu's calm, professional competence is on full display in this episode. You knew it was just a matter of time until he'd be promoted and offered command of his own ship.Although this was the 10th episode shown, it was the first regular production episode.

10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Corbomite Maneuver (TV Episode 1966)","Wonderful Trek Episode, As Usual For Season One","They are showing remastered Star Trek on the armed forces network at the time I am in front of the TV, so this is jogging all my memories and giving me new insights and I'd like to share them here, thanks. Corbomite Maneuver is a childhood memory for me. Not when it was first shown as I was only 2 1/2 then, but later when I watched it in reruns after school when I was probably between 7 and 9 in the early 70's. It is a great episode to watch as a child because it is not in the typical sci fi mode of all sides having similar strength, here I witnessed a scene that blew my very youthful mind and expanded the way I thought odf possibilities that for many like myself we never would havce thought of unless something like this made us aware of them. I'm talking about the scene where the alien ship comes against the Enterprise and dwarfs it in size, this scene would be replayed to great effect in season two's The Immunity Syndrome but is very rarely seen in science fiction in general in regards to spacecraft, it shows some awesome creativity from those who wrote Star Trek, and it's what helped make it so great. I have not seen this in several years but I was hooked to see the ""enhanced"" new effects in the remastered edition and I noticed that in the beginning that this was obviously a very early episode, which was confirmed by the trivia at IMDb.com (the internet and this site are great!), as a matter of fact, this was the first filmed episode after the two pilots. Everyone is explained very nicely as an introduction for our cast of characters, still some refinement to come, I noticed Spock expresses his Father and Mother in the past tense as if they were deceased, McCoy is using the Captain word a lot instead of Jim, Sulu is the time keeper instead of Spock, etc etc.In the 90's you could get a Star Trek video made at Universal Studios (as seen in many youtube posts), I made one myself and it always brings back great memories even though it was made with my ex wife, lol. In that video they pull a Corbomite type bluff against the Klingon's, its a great plot twist and I don't recall many if any other TV shows I've seen it on! I also keep seeing in some posts about Star Trek, ""Why didn't they have seat-belts?"" Well Star Trek is based on 20th century naval drama, that is why the Captain is a Captain and not a Colonel. I thought of my time on a ship and very few if any seats have seat belts, I wondered why and it must be so you can move about quickly to assist others that may need it. Now the scene where everyone of the crew is kind of line dancing in the corridors is stupid as they would be at their battle station's but we can acknowledge that when you are at sea on a smaller ship in heavy seas that you will move from bulkhead to bulkhead that way. But in case anyone was interested since this was the first regular filmed episode I think they were relying a lot on the naval element for the show, it would get refined for space as we went along, it still woks pretty good even early on.I get the idea of the ""remastered"" treatment now. It gives people like me who have seen Trek TOS repeatedly over 365 tears a reason to revist it, but more importantly it gives the Gen X and Gen Y's a chance to watch without totally dismissing it because of the 1966 TV effect's which although were excellent compared to what else was out there (the best?), are easy to nitpick and will get nit picked by younger viewers. I understand all that and think overall now that its great that the effects were redone, god job! My overall rating was when I first saw this episode as young tot, 10 of 10 all time best, now as an adult after double digit viewings, still a 10 of 10 (not the best but still great), a great episode and a great introduction for anyone new to the series to watch.

So I will commence in pointing out some glaring blunders in these cherished episodes.Today's episode ""THE CORBOMITE MANEUVER"" - The entire basis of the plot hinges on Balok's ""testing"" of the Enterprise crew & captain as being a civilized species. Balok sends a warning buoy with fatal radiation levels that reach lethal doses until the phasers blow it up before it destroys the Enterprise. - Bailey becomes totally unhinged with some very over-the-top acting. - A tracker beam then grabs the Enterprise by the newly arrived mother ship. - Balok then dismisses any further communication from Kirk. Balok blows up their recorder marker and then tells Kirk that they are to be destroyed because they showed their violent side by destroying his buoy. Thus starts a 10 min. count down to the Enterprises destruction. - Kirk then bluffs that his ship is equipped with the lethal Corbomite Device and only then does Balok stop the countdown and wavier. He then demands proof of the device. - Balok then tows the Enterprise and threatens to maroon the crew on a planet or destroy the Enterprise if they resist. Kirk has to almost tear the ship apart to break free. - Finally, when Kirk shows some humanity despite having the upper hand, Balok invites them aboard his ship. They share some Tang and he admits to testing them . and then laugh off the events. WTF? Is he a sadist? And what would he have said/done ""if"" Kirk ""had"" surrendered his ship? Laugh it off or shrug and just take the f—ckin thing and maroon the crew? He has the ear marks of a sociopath. - I get the whole testing them but one has to admit he took it to the nth degree. Sure, he is a baby version of Clint Howard and yeah, I get how he knows no one will take him seriously, but jumpin, me thinks he took it too far. - Observation: It must bug Clint that his crowning achievement as a child actor is ""this"" role which ironically foreshadows his own baldness.

But considering their goal is exploration and finding babes for Kirk, they ignore the warning and assume everything will work out for the best (perhaps they read the script and knew everything would be fine). Unfortunately, a hugely powerful being that looks MEGA-creepy announces that he is going to destroy them for their insolence! Bummer. Well, Kirk being a very quick thinker bluffs the ugly dude so that they can escape. However, what happens next I'll leave for you to see for yourself, but the results are well worth seeing. The episode is smartly written and does a lot to explore the characters' motivations and foibles.",8
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Corbomite Maneuver (TV Episode 1966)","Clever premise, though a bit dragged out","This episode had a clever premise that I still think stands up fairly well, on re-watch: Kirk gets out of a seemingly impossible situation by the simple tactic of bluffing. I love the 'chess' and 'poker' analogies and use them all the time in my own life. In general, I think situations in life are much more often like poker than chess; there is little or no certainty, and quite a bit of luck, chance, and blustering, which sometimes work (and sometimes don't). One sees the same sort of thing all the time in such matters as legal proceedings, interactions between sovereign nations, and business transactions, for example. Are these things like chess? No, not really, or seldom so; generally not precisely calculable, at all, and with much room for trickery and the taking of gambles.My only complaint about the episode is that it drags on for too long. Ideally, this could have been tightly done in maybe 30 minutes, but they had to fill a 50 minute time slot, so the episode definitely feels 'padded'.The minor subplot with Bailey did end up paying off nicely in the end, as Kirk deals with a potential problem (getting rid of an inexperienced officer that he promoted too quickly) while also gaining valuable information about a new alien species.",7
16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Corbomite Maneuver (TV Episode 1966)",We're Off to See the Wizard!,"""The Corbomite Maneuver"" is an episode with a very odd tone to it. A combination of the score, strange camera angles, and the action on screen really makes this episode stand out from the sum of its parts. The presence of the strange cube, the large ship, the menacing voice, all add flavor to thus. All these bells and whistles are reminiscent of the plot of ""The Wizard of Oz"". But unlike that movie's message, this plot device is used to test the crew of the Enterprise, to ascertain their motives. I have to say, the most disturbing thing to me was the episode's final reveal of Balok. His appearance and the ship's interior design, mixed with the incongruous voice really had an uncomforting effect on me as a viewer. The fact that Bailey decides to stay there and learn from him didn't help things. I guess the messages of this episode is tolerance of others and don't judge a commanding officer by his puppet. Fine messages, but this episode isn't my favorite. I did like the tension building of the music and images though.",7

It is one of the episodes where he surpasses Spock. A great episode to sit and watch. I enjoyed it when I was a kid and now again I enjoyed it again. Should not miss it for kirk's hunger for taking risks and always being on the front is remarkable. Normally , he depends on his first officer spock or bones in star trek episodes. Spock is for logic and bones as always get emotional and excited in every episode. The leadership qualities portrayed here are so great that we can learn lessons from them. Kirk is such a character in the Start Trek series that he always likes to take risks, sometimes it works, sometimes he his helped by spock/bones. Anyway this would truly be an interesting episode which I would recommend for all Kirk and Start Trek fans to watch again.",10

He invented all that technology by himself? I was expecting Kirk to wake up from a nightmare or something and it was all a dream. Utterly ridiculous!!!!",7

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. Unlike any other hit series, it only has 3 seasons so luckily it means that they will be covering up all their ideas within it until they are satisfied. As it often happens, the first season is always promising and has potential (or else it won't lift up for further more seasons) in it and is utilized with fine detailed work like focusing on different new breeds and characters bonding through this journey.At this point, something out of the box was essential and they delivered it just in time and now it feels completely like Star Trek. This probably is the first one where ship to ship dilemma is projected and even though it had a wafer thin script with witty writing and creating close encounters they keep the audience on the edge of the seat.",

In this episode we see why Captain James T Kirk was qualified in the first place to be the Captain. He held up under the pressure. Yes, he had help from the First Officer. He also had to deal with a junior officer, a younger version of himself who was too impulsive. But when things were really bad, and the ship and all the lives were at stake, Kirk assessed his options, played a poker bluff and acted accordingly.The bluff worked out. He and the Doctor forgave each other for their disagreements. And the 5 year mission of seeking out new civilizations continued.",9

Kirk comes up with the idea of a poker game with the aliens and bluffs them with the ship having dangerous (but fictitious) corbomite.

A voice announces that the Enterprise and its crew have been judged to be dangerous and they will be destroyed in ten minutes. As the minutes pass navigator Lt Bailey starts to panic and is relieved of duty. Spock manages to open a video link and we see the alien; an imposing humanoid who identifies himself as Commander Balok. Spock compares the situation to a game of chess but Kirk disagree; he says it is a game of poker and in a game of poker one may bluff. That is just what Kirk does when he announces that the Enterprise, and other Star Fleet vessels, are fitted with something called the 'Corbomite Device' which will automatically destroy any ship that attacks. Will Balok call his bluff or back down?The special effects may seem a little dated now but this is still a classic episode with an enjoyable twist in the tail. It was interesting to see how the stress of the situation affected people; most obvious was Lt Bailey but it was also noticeable that Kirk was getting snappy; especially when McCoy points out that he had warned Kirk about Bailey's rapid promotion to a position he wasn't ready for. Balok proves to be one of the series most memorable antagonists; I loved how it turned out that he wasn't quite what he first appeared. Away from the main story it was fun to see Kirk forced to undergo a fitness test then being put on a salad diet! The cast all do a solid job in this early (in the production run) episode.

As is the case frequently in many Star Trek incarnations, it becomes a battle of wits between Kirk and the evil force. With Kirk, Picard, Janeway, etc., the bluff is the thing. It's often what being a starship Captain is all about. There are really two issues: to escape the threat and to figure out what to do with the young officer. All this is resolved.

The move was made out of necessity, to combat deadline problems in getting episodes produced (such a sf show back in the 1960s was a hassle to get done on time). One positive outcome back then was that audiences, unaware of the pilot produced almost a couple of years earlier, were treated to a whole new crew and captain for these two episodes on top of the regular cast of characters, as if the producers had spent double the money on these episodes to present a TV epic spanning a dozen years of Starfleet history (though they still used terms such as 'United Space Fleet' in these early episodes).The wraparound story begins as a space mystery plot: the Enterprise is diverted to Starbase 11 for unknown reasons and very soon Spock is a suspect in these shenanigans. Astonishingly, though even McCoy belabors the fact that Spock's Vulcan heritage makes subterfuge on his part impossible, it does turn out that Spock is indeed acting out some mutinous scheme to shanghai our precious starship and kidnap his former captain, Pike, now horribly crippled. Well, Spock is half human, we tend to forget. Or has he simply gone mad? It may very well be, for he's directing Enterprise to Talos IV, a planet so off-limits it's the subject of the only known death penalty on Starfleet's books. When the jig is up, there's a great scene of Spock surrendering to a flabbergasted McCoy, as Uhura looks on in shock. Even Kirk, usually steady as a captain should be, doesn't know what to make of his first officer's illogical conduct.In the 3rd and final acts, we begin to see transmitted images of a mission of the Enterprise from 13 years prior, when Capt. Pike was commanding and Spock was one of his officers. We really don't know where all this is going and what Spock hopes to accomplish - and that's another thing that makes this a very good 2-parter - we really need to find out what it's all about in the 2nd part. Not only is Spock facing severe penalties, but it looks like Kirk's career may be finished, as well. Double jeopardy, folks. This is also the 1st televised episode to feature one of those shuttlecrafts (none were available in the earlier ""The Enemy Within"" when the crafts were really needed). There's also one of those neat matte paintings to convey the ambiance of a futuristic starbase - this was the only way to visualize such things back then. Finally, check out Kirk's smug approach at the start of the episode - boy, do things go sideways on him as the story progresses.",8
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Menagerie: Part I (TV Episode 1966)",The original pilot revisited - Part One,"It is a well known fact that when Gene Roddenberry first pitched Star Trek to NBC, the original pilot episode, The Cage, was rejected for being ""too cerebral"". When the series was given another chance, Roddenberry thought it would be fun to establish the events of the rejected episode as canon, and did so by writing The Menagerie, which has the unique distinction of being the sequel to what was still, at the time, an unaired episode.This time, rather than exploring a new planet, Kirk and his crew are on Starbase 11, paying a visit to the former commander of the Enterprise, Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney), now horribly disfigured and paralyzed because of an accident. Pike joins his successor on the starship, where an unpleasant surprise awaits: Spock, who used to serve under Pike, has effectively hijacked the vessel and set the course for Talos IV, a planet which is off-limits (the punishment is death) since Pike and Spock's last visit there, 13 years earlier. Naturally, being a logical creature, Spock turns himself in and arranges a court-martial so that he can justify his actions.There's no need to say more about the plot, since the rest will play out in Part 2. What really impresses is how Roddenberry creates the connection between The Cage and the rest of the Star Trek universe, by coming up with a particular type of flashback (to say more would be too much) that allows everyone, on screen and off, to see what could have been of Trek, had NBC not turned down the original project. In particular, it's fun to see Jeffrey Hunter (who was unable to return in The Menagerie) play Pike as a more serious captain than Kirk usually is and Nimoy's early days as Spock, whose personality hadn't been fully established yet: this is the only time in the entire series that everybody's favorite Vulcan spontaneously grins.In short, not just a great ""mystery"" episode, but also a treat for those who can't be bothered to track down The Cage in its original form (it's available as part of the Season 3 box set).",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Menagerie: Part I (TV Episode 1966)",Someone left the Cage open a little.,"I loved this two part episode as a young man, and i still love it today. I wanted to get that out of the way first. I love it despite all the inconsistency in the script. I know a lot of people will say you can pick apart any show or film you want. And that is probably true. However, ""The Menagerie"" parts I and II have errors in the script that go to the very heart of the story and makes it weaker and less believable.At the core of these problems are the planning by Mr. Spock and the long range abilities of the Talosians. How in the name of Vulcan did Spock plan all this when he had no contact with the Talosians? When Kirk and Spock first visit Captain Pike it appears (to me anyway) that Pike already knows what Spock is up to and tries to stop him from carrying out his plan. But Spock had no contact with Captain Pike prior to the visit at the beginning of the episode. So when did Spock sit down with the Talosians and Captain Pike and plan all this? The Talosians even say, ""Spock related Kirk's strength of will to us."" Really? When exactly? However, even worse than this mistake is the fact that the Talosians ""created"" the image of Commodore Mendez at Star Base 11 as Captain Kirk boards a shuttle craft to chase the Enterprise. Really? The Talosians power is so great they can project an image all the way to a Federation Star Base! Really? If this is true, then why didn't the Talosians just project an image of Captain Pike at Star Base 11 so that nobody would know he was gone? Even worse, if Commodore Mendez was still at Star Base 11 during this entire time why didn't he try and contact the Enterprise or the Federation and let them know that he(Mendez) was not aboard the shuttle craft? Near the end of the episode the Federation contacts the Enterprise and orders ""Mendez"" to take command of the Enterprise. Why doesn't anyone in the Federation know that Mendez is still at Star Base 11? I am not sure how to solve the first problem of the planning, but the second part would have been easy to solve. Commodore Mendez should never have been a Talosian image. Mendez should have been real all along. There was no reason to make him an image. By having the real Mendez on board the Enterprise would have solved all this. After seeing the evidence the real Mendez would have been convinced of the need for Pike to remain with the Talosians and Spock's innocence of all charges. I think this would have made the entire episode much better. As it is I can only give this episode 7 out of 10. Although I want to make it higher as this is a great concept of a story.",7

And the cliffhanger leaves much to be answered and you definitely will want to stay to watch part II.

The same might be said for the events in this episode - a compilation and remix of ""The Cage,"" the first pilot of Star Trek. Mr. Spock has cleverly commandeered the ship to take it to the forbidden planet Talos IV in order to allow Capt. Christopher Pike, his first captain who has been burned and paralyzed, to return there. Why the finagling? Because to have any contact at all with Talos IV invites a death sentence. Why this is so is never explained - that bothered me tremendously - but, if nothing else, it adds to the story. After he has gotten the ship to travel to Talos IV, Mr. Spock turns himself in to Dr. McCoy (the senior-most officer present; Capt. Kirk was off the ship) for arrest and says, ""The charge is mutiny, Dr.; I never received orders to take over the ship."" What follows is a court martial in which - thanks to the Talosians - we learn why it was so important (besides the obvious paralysis) for Capt. Pike to get to Talos IV even at risk of Mr. Spock's death. The illusions the Talosians create, the background music and the entire storyline are fantastic. And Meg Wyllie as The Keeper (the head Talosian) is wonderful. Call me sexist but it never occurred to me to have a woman in that role but she was perfect! The Talosians, having given up almost all physical activity and becoming almost completely reliant upon the power of illusion, are also unisex; you can't really tell if they're male or female and it really doesn't matter. This episode, more than almost any other in the series, makes me hope and pray there are other worlds out there and that there are civilizations that are so far advanced! What a neat thing if this were so! This is one of my favorite episodes and, no matter how many times I've seen it (I even have it on video), it never fails to fascinate me.

Now imagine yourself sharing this gift with the love of your life. What would you do? Would such powers be worth your soul? This is the dilemma presented to Captain Christopher Pike in ""The Cage"" the now-legendary pilot episode of the original Star Trek series. Famously deemed ""too cerebral"" and ""too cold"" by NBC brass and rejected, ""The Cage"" was nevertheless the most ambitious and costly pilot ever made in the history of the network at the time, and Gene Roddenberry did not want to let all that effort and expense go to waste, with the result being this truly classic Star Trek episode, which embeds ""The Cage"" into a frame story which deepens and extends the emotional and philosophical depth of this haunting tale, a landmark in TV history and one of the first truly serious sci-fi stories ever filmed for the small screen...Star Date 3012: The USS Enterprise diverts to Starbase 11 after Mr. Spock receives an urgent message from the former commander of the Enterprise. Surprisingly, the message cannot be from Captain Pike after all, as he is now confined to a wheelchair, mute and horribly disfigured after a tragic accident. Kirk and Starbase commanding officer Commodore Mendez attempt to get to the bottom of the mystery, but before the matter can be cleared up, Spock - for reasons as yet unknown - commits an act of open mutiny, kidnapping the helpless Captain Pike and hijacking the Enterprise via a brilliantly thought-out and timed plan aided by a few Vulcan nerve pinches. Soon, the Enterprise is headed for the remote, forbidden planet of Talos IV. Mendez informs Kirk that Talos IV is under interdiction, and any contact with the planet by Starfleet vessels or personnel carries an immediate death sentence, meaning that Spock appears to be deliberately destroying himself, and Kirk as well, given that the Captain will be held responsible for the ship's activities. Appalled, Kirk and Mendez give chase in a shuttlecraft, which itself becomes dangerous when the Enterprise refuses to answer their calls or pick up the craft until power and oxygen are nearly gone. Spock - knowing that Kirk must be the one following the ship - is of course unable to consign the Captain to certain death. After ordering the craft to be retrieved and the occupants beamed aboard, Spock reveals what he has done to McCoy and demands to be arrested, after having set the starship on an irreversible course to Talos IV. Upon reassuming command, Kirk demands an explanation, whereupon Spock requests immediate court martial by a tribunal of Starfleet commanding officers - of whom there are three on board - Mendez, Kirk, and the crippled invalid Captain Pike. Spock's encyclopedic knowledge of Starfleet regulations enables him to manipulate the tribunal into allowing him to present otherwise inadmissible evidence. Spock presents video recordings of the only contact ever made between the Federation and the inhabitants of Talos IV - a journey taken 13 years earlier by the Enterprise itself under Pike's command. Kirk expresses doubts about the authenticity of the video due to its extreme detail, but the reality of the events depicted is confirmed by Pike himself, who turns out to have been lured to Talos IV by a distress call from the alleged survivors of a Federation research vessel which crashed there 18 years previously. Among the survivors is Vina, a stunning beauty said to have been born just before the disaster. Pike is attracted to the girl and allows her to lure him to an isolated spot, whereupon he is waylaid and captured by the Talosians, a race of androgynous humanoids with enormous cranial capacity and the power to transform thoughts into virtual reality. After Pike's capture, the rest of the ""survivors"" vanish as none of them really existed except Vina. The episode ends when the tribunal learns that Spock's ""evidence"" is in fact being transmitted to the Enterprise directly from Talos IV, in violation of Starfleet regulations.

Using the devise of a fake court marshal, Spock retells the story from 13 years ago of Christopher Pike, former starship captain and hero, now trapped in a totally paralyzed body, (in a futuristic wheelchair) due to a horrific warp core accident. It's all an illusion, from the masters of it all, The Talosians from forbidden planet Talos IV.

Obviously, this was to try recoup some of the money they had thrown at this project. Christopher Pike, who was Kirk's predecessor on the Enterprise, is basically left with his thoughts. His body was destroyed in a fire where he heroically save a group of children. He is in a kind of box/wheelchair where his brain can answer questions by way of a light that flashes. Mr. Spock, out of loyalty to his old Captain, kidnaps Pike and takes him to Talos IV, a planet forbidden to the Federation. Spock actually lies about his reasons and is brought up for court martial and potential execution. During the trial the evidence is damning and the judges, including Kirk, have pretty much seen enough. There is a tape of the whole thing. Spock insists on them watching the whole tape, but must beg at the end of the episode. Trying to gerrymander a plot around a previous piece of film doesn't work very well, but in this case it keeps us guessing.

Earlier stories in the series may have been good, but this was the first great one. It's well detailed and highly suspenseful, with a mystery that makes the viewer highly anticipate the resolution to Spock's behavior. The writing also solidifies the dual nature of Spock's heredity. As part Vulcan he's incapable of lying, as half human, one must consider whether that part of his make up is prone to treachery and treason. Besides all of that, you also have the intrigue of Talos IV, and why Fleet Command would impose a death sentence for any of it's members to venture to that planet. All very 'fascinating' as Spock himself might be prone to describe it if he wasn't so busy manipulating the ship records on the Enterprise to cover for his subterfuge.

There is no reason for any ""Grains of Salt"" - This is Gene Roddenberry's Masterpiece, this is *his* Star Trek, and it was not overly bloated with the ""enhancements"" of Fosse: Nothing was ""Re- imagined"" because there was no need for any re-imagining. Majel Lee Hudec as ""Number One"" brings a Laser cannon down to the planet and they try to blow the top off of a rock face, and that effect remains as beautiful as it originally appeared, to me, over 40 years ago.That is the entire problem with all of the digital ""enhancements"" - There really was no need for them, and to CHANGE their nature, to CHANGE those classic images is a crime.Of all the ""enhanced"" episodes I've watched, so far, this one remains fairly close to the way the original looked.

As a kid, I liked this two-parter, but also felt the plot made no sense--and only when I learned about the show's pedigree did I understand why. Seeing the original crew and Roddenberry's original idea for the show is really amazing--especially since it's all so ""alien"" since only two crew members returned for the actual series and only one of those in the same role from the original pilot (Spock). Plus THE MENAGERIE is a great episode! However, since the episode is so hacked apart and spliced together in a poor and contrived way, I DON'T recommend you see it. I also think the 'clever way' of hiding the fact that Jeffery Hunter was not used in the new material was REALLY lame! Instead, try to find the original unedited pilot episode entitled THE CAGE. This is one of the better episodes ever made and it's great seeing this alternative vision for the series.",6
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Menagerie: Part I (TV Episode 1966)",Spock commits treason for his old captain,"As this two part story opens the Enterprise diverts to Starbase 11 after Spock claims to have received a subspace message from his former captain, Christopher Pike. It soon becomes apparent that Pike couldn't have sent any message as he has been severely injured and can only communicate 'yes or no' by beeping once or twice. As Kirk tries to get to the bottom of what is going on Spock sends orders to the Enterprise which enable him to take Pike to the planet Talos IV; going there is the only capital offence in the Federation for reasons that are so serious they remain classified! Kirk and the commander of the star base pursue in a shuttle and when they get to the Enterprise Spock is placed in custody but the ship continues to head to Talos IV. During his court martial Spock starts to show them details of the only visit by a Federation ship to Talos IV; the time the Enterprise, under the command of Capt. Pike went there thirteen years previously. We see how they were lured there by a false distress signal and how Pike was captured by aliens. To discover what happens next we'll have to watch part two!This, the only two part story in the original series, nicely uses scenes from the original pilot, 'The Cage' in an almost entirely new story. There is a good sense of mystery as surely the ever reliable Spock would be incapable of breaking any rule, let alone one so serious, unless he had a very good reason. We are also treated to the sight of Spock overpowering Star Fleet computer engineers prior so he can give plausible orders that will enable him to take command of the Enterprise. Once his trial begins and we start to see scenes that were originally part of 'The Cage' it is nicely explained how we can see recordings of the action form viewpoints where there wouldn't have been cameras to record the scene or even private moments that wouldn't be recorded at all. The thirteen year time gap serves to explain why most of the crew of Pike's Enterprise have been replaced and why the uniforms have changed. Overall this was a fine episode that made good use of material from the original pilot and set things up nicely for the concluding part of the story which will tell us the truth about the planet Talos IV and why Spock would risk everything to take his former captain there.",9
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Menagerie: Part I (TV Episode 1966)",confused but intriguing two-part episode,"For a long time, 'The Menagerie' was my favorite 'Star Trek' episode though in recent years it has been eclipsed by 'City on the Edge of Forever.' What I used to prefer about 'Menagerie' was that it's more hard-core Star Trek with this fascinating back-story to the then-current Trek storyline. I still think it's fairly ingenious the way Gene Roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two-part episode. Though the 'new' part of the story is largely an excuse for Kirk and a few others (and us) to watch the pilot, the idea of Spock being court-martialed is a clever one. You can poke holes in the plot if you want. For instance, given the Talosians' mind-control abilities and Captain Pike's condition, why is it even necessary to physically bring Pike back to their planet? And there are other confusing questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez... best to not think too hard about the details and just enjoy ST's only two-parter.",7

15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Menagerie: Part I (TV Episode 1966)",Where One Man Has Gone Before,"In part one of ""The Menagerie"", Spock claims that the Enterprise has received a distress call from a starbase. Unbeknownst to Kirk, Spock has lied about this SOS because he intends to kidnap one of the planet's inhabitants, former captain of the Enterprise Christopher Pike. With Pike in tow, Spock plans to use deception to take over command of the Enterprise and make a heading for Talos IV, the one planet Star Fleet forbids ships to even approach. But when Kirk almost kills himself in pursuit of the Enterprise, Spock saves him and turns on the autopilot of the Enterprise, using the computer to force a course for Talos IV. Charged with treason, Spock must now reveal the purpose of all this subterfuge. We cut to flashbacks from the original pilot ""The Cage."" As Part I ends, Spock is locked up and the Enterprise continues its course for Talos IV. This episode was probably pretty amazing at the time if you had never seen the unreleased pilot prior to this. Nowadays with Netflix, ""The Cage"" is the first episode listed and usually the starting point for most bingers. And while already seeing some of this footage from ""The Cage"" does make the feat of hiring such a robust cast for this episode a little less impressive, I still think this episode is fantastic. This episode may exist because of budgetary and time issues but Roddenberry does a great job of tying it all together.I love the tone of this episode. The way Spock is portrayed, you really have no idea what his intentions are; the episode leaves this part vague, really causing a sense of tension. Nimoy and Shatner have some great scenes in this one. I also enjoyed how Spock has had every single contingency planned out, even anticipating Kirk's pursuit.One of the better episodes up to this point, we will see if part two can deliver on a great front end.",8

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. Unlike any other hit series, it only has 3 seasons so luckily it means that they will be covering up all their ideas within it until they are satisfied. As it often happens, the first season is always promising and has potential (or else it won't lift up for further more seasons) in it and is utilized with fine detailed work like focusing on different new breeds and characters bonding through this journey.It certainly has a new angle and when a protagonist goes rogue things always spice up and ups the ante a bit and addition to that the court room drama, flashback sequences and political twists certainly won't feel Star Trek and still defines Star Trek at its best.",

Instead of dying after an injury on a film set Jeffrey Hunter had been with the Star Trek series for it's three season run, would it have become the iconic thing it has? Would Hunter be the cult figure that William Shatner has?In Menagerie Shatner on a space station lay over with the Enterprise discovers his predecessor Captain Christopher Pike now confined to a futuristic wheelchair, his body destroyed pretty much by an explosion. Leonard Nimoy was part of the crew that served with Captain Pike.The arrival of the Enterprise at the space station however is all part of a carefully laid plan by Leonard Nimoy. He takes the Enterprise out with Captain Pike on board and they're heading to Talos IV a planet where the Federation has prohibited visiting under penalty of death. Shatner with Malachi Throne the commander of the space station gives pursuit in a shuttle craft. But when the craft runs out of fuel Nimoy halts the Enterprise and submits himself for court martial. As his defense we see very accurate computer records of Captain Pike's journey to Talos IV when it was unexplored by the Federation.Here we see Jeffrey Hunter as Pike answering a distress call on Talos IV and when they arrive there he and an away team beam down to get the survivors. But the Talosians take Hunter prisoner down to an underground city where they live.What they want him for and why visiting Talos IV is death is in the second part, but it has a lot to do with the beautiful Susan Oliver one of the survivors.A lot of Christopher Pike's character is later incorporated into James Kirk. I would say Captain Kirk is a far more intellectual character than Pike, but Pike's no slouch in the brain department. Spock is not a fully formed character, we really have no point of reference for him in the Menagerie episode only. The rest all come in the cast we all have come to know.",7

Kirk, Bones and Spock beam down and learn that former Captain of the Enterprise  Christopher Pike is confined to a futuristic wheelchair and can only communicate through a light: a flash once for yes and 2 flashes for no via his brainwaves. There is no way Pike made a ""call"" to the Enterprise.  While Kirk speaks with Commodore Mendez about this strange occurrence, Spock beams aboard the ship, overrides the all the computers, has tape recordings of Kirk giving commands, has Bones to beam aboard, beams up Pike and takes off in the Enterprise toward the forbidden planet of Talos IV leaving Kirk behind. Mendez and Kirk jump into a shuttle craft to follow, Spock gives the command to beam the two aboard the Enterprise and orders Bones to arrest him. A court martial follows and Spock pleads guilty to mutiny.  The cliffhanger is in the middle of Spock's court martial hearing.This episode ties into the original pilot episode The Cage, with parts of The Cage being shown by Spock at his own trial.I really like this particular episode.. it's different.

19,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Menagerie: Part I (TV Episode 1966)",A peek at the Trek that could have been,"Plot; Spock concocts an elaborate hijacking of the Enterprise in an effort to return his former Captain, now gravely injured, to a planet deemed forbidden by the Federation for reasons only he and Pike know.Iconic two-parter is a reworking of the original (and ultimately rejected) pilot episode titled ""The Cage"", with Spock's plot to hijack the Enterprise and the subsequent fallout a wraparound. The mystery of Spock's behavior and the tension it creates is handled fairly well and acts as the driving force behind the story. And it was, to borrow one of Spock's well known sayings, fascinating to get a look at the Trek that could have been.Jeffery Hunter as Christopher Pike is a very different presence than William Shatner, but he's far from the stiff Ken doll I'd always thought him to be. Hunter, with his powerful physique and matinée idol looks, certainly looks the part of a heroic space captain, but he shows a far broader spectrum than I'd given him credit for. It was also fun to get a look at Nimoy's Spock before he and the writers had gotten a handle on him. The Spock shown in ""The Cage"" portions of the episodes conflicts with the cool, dispassionate Spock that has become so iconic. In one scene, when the away team land on the planet, he even grins with a child-like glee upon discovering a strange pit of flora.There are any number of flaws in--if you'll pardon the usage--logic here. Chief among them for me is that there is never a connection between Spock and Pike in ""The Cage"" portions of the story that would precipitate the former risking death and acting so against character. That it isn't a fatal flaw shows how well the rest of the elements work.",7
20,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Menagerie: Part I (TV Episode 1966)",Kind of Lame,"I like the premise of this episode and having already seen The Cage (the original pilot episode of Star Trek) I know exactly where this is going and why. However, I think that they had way too much of the episode The Cage footage and not enough original footage for part one of The Menagerie. Another problem that I have is that the actor they are using to play the part of Captain Pike has very blond hair when the original Pike had dark brown hair. And finally, I do not really understand why the episode is called The Menagerie.Other than those complaints about this episode, I did really like it. I like how Spock was still quite loyal to his previous captain. I completely believed that Spock would act in such a manner. I think they all did a good job with the acting. It was nice that they explained how Spock could have all that video evidence when it really wasn't available from original tapes at the time this all took place.If you have been fortunate to see this series starting with The Cage and going froward from there, you will definitely appreciate The Menagerie parts 1 and 2. It all ties in very nicely. I saw this series when it first came out. I was only 4 when it began, but I remember it well and I fell in love with Spock (and Leonard Nimoy). Since then I have watched this entire series many times and I never tire of it. In my opinion, the original Star Trek is by far the best of all of them. Watching it all again this time, beginning with the original pilot has been a treat.",7
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Menagerie: Part II (TV Episode 1966)",Kirk Observes his Predecessor in Action - part two,"This continues the plot of part one, with most of the episode consisting of Spock, Kirk, commodore Mendez and the crippled Pike (played by another actor, not Jeff Hunter) seated in a conference room watching movies of one of Pike's past missions. This may sound quite boring, but viewers had the opportunity to see how two separate suspenseful plots would conclude - the one with Pike in the past and the one with Kirk and Spock. This doubled impact was especially true if a viewer had never seen the original pilot ""The Cage."" Footage from ""The Cage"" dominated this second part, consisting of about 70% of this episode (whereas this was the case for the wraparound portion in the first part).There was at least one unexplained delay during the showing of these space home movies as the 3rd act ended, as the images stopped being transmitted. This allowed the script to throw in some more jeopardy as Spock was found officially guilty by the 3 ranking officers as they waited for the show to continue. Yep, things still looked pretty grim at this point: Spock still seemed to have betrayed his current captain - Kirk - and faced a death penalty (I do wonder how it was done in the 23rd century - death by phasers? That would probably be painless). But, to Roddenberry's credit, he managed to throw in a little whammy towards the end of his wraparound tale which probably surprised the audience and made complete sense in view of what kind of aliens Pike had faced during his past mission. I think Kirk forgave Spock a bit too quickly as the episode ended and all the 'death penalty' threats evaporated too easily, but Pike's final scene and final fate here is about as good as science fiction gets.",8
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Menagerie: Part II (TV Episode 1966)",The original pilot revisited - Part Two,"When NBC turned down the original Star Trek pilot The Cage, which still had Leonard Nimoy but starred Jeffrey Hunter instead of William Shatner, many people assumed that episode was gone forever. They were wrong: not only can it be seen on the Season 3 DVD, it was actually incorporated into two other episodes of the series, as part of Gene Roddenberry's attempt to acknowledge the episode's existence on-screen. The merger comes to a head in the second part of The Menagerie, arguably one of the best Star Trek episodes, or at least as far as the first season is concerned.Picking up from the end of Part One, Spock's court-martial continues, and the officers judging him (including Kirk) are offered a visual testimony of what happened 13 years earlier, when Pike was imprisoned on Talos IV, the now forbidden planet Spock is trying to bring him back to. As the images, which are revealed to be mental projections coming from the Talosians themselves, progress and the truth about Pike's harrowing experience is revealed, Spock's motive becomes clearer and the mystery gets closer to its rather surprising conclusion.The main interest of the episode lies in the fact that it features very little of the regular cast: about 70% of the footage is archive material from The Cage, featuring Jeffrey Hunter as Pike and Leonard Nimoy as a more ""human"" Spock (yes, you read that correctly). This extended flashback is a clever trick used by Gene Roddenberry to tie his two visions of Star Trek together, uniting what could have been with what actually came to be. Remarkably, from what can be seen here, the ""first draft"" turned out to be every bit as riveting as the final version, except for the absence of one James T. Kirk.As a standalone mystery story, The Menagerie holds up beautifully. It's the heartfelt inclusion of the previously unaired footage, however, that lends it that extra emotional punch. In fact, it's a bit of a shame Captain Pike wasn't brought back in some other form when Roddenberry rewrote the pilot script: it would have been fun to see the character interact properly with Kirk.",10

Watch out also for Majel Barret as Number One (she would later play Nurse Chapel and the Enterprise Computer, whereas the title would be adopted by William Riker in Star Trek: The Next Generation). All in all, a brilliant two part episode, which was honored with a Hugo Award for Best Television Sci-Fi Program.",
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Menagerie: Part II (TV Episode 1966)",The reason Spock risked everything to go to Talos IV,"This, the second of a two part story, concentrates on what happened to Captain Pike after he had been captured by the Talosians. In scenes that will be familiar to anybody who has seen the original pilot episode, The Cage, we see Pike subjected to various mental tests. He is joined by beautiful blonde Vina who he assumes is another of the Talosian illusions. They put him in various situations where he is tested in various ways. Eventually it emerges that Vina is real; the sole survivor of a crash that took place eighteen years previously and the Talosians have lured Pike there hoping that he will breed with Vina. Of course her appearance is one of the illusions they created; in reality she is old and disfigured it is this that Spock wanted to show; if the Talosians can make her young, healthy and beautiful they can make Pike believe he is young, fit and able-bodied again.Having decided against going ahead with the version of 'Star Trek' featuring Captain Pike this story, and particularly this episode, does a fine job of ensuring the filmed material didn't go to waste. The idea of having a crippled Pike taken back to the one world where he could live like a fully able bodied person provided a good excuse to show us the story from 'The Cage' and the Talosian's ability to create illusions nicely explained why we can see 'footage' from places their wouldn't naturally be cameras. Whether one likes this episode does of course depend on what you think of 'The Cage' and whether you mind the main cast, with the exception of Spock, taking a back seat or not appearing at all. Overall I thought this was a really good episode that nicely used the old footage from 'The Cage'.",9

Christopher Pike and ""Vina"" (Susan Oliver) the only survivor of a previous crash landing, several decade before, by a Federation ship. Commodore Mendez is an illusion and the visual record has such detail that ""it surpasses normal Federation records"" of such events. Both are being ""streamed"" from Talos IV. It turns out that Vina's appearance is also an illusion, as the Talos IV aliens ""put her together"" wrong, having never seen a human before. In reality, she is lop-sided, hunch-backed, and extremely old. Poor paralyzed Captain Pike and Vina have their illusion of perfect bodies, health and youth, and scamper off into the sunset (or into the underground compound, in this case.) ""Capt. Pike has his illusion and you have reality. May you find your way as pleasant"". (The Keeper's kind statement) The fairy tale ending is what makes this two-parter really work.

In fact illusion is the Talosian stock in trade. They can make you see and feel just about any experience they care to give you. It's how they can hold prisoners.What they want is for Hunter to find Oliver really attractive and get down to the business of mating. Even with creating things out of pure thought there is certainly physical work to do that the Talosians have just forgotten how. How Hunter overcomes this is for you to watch the episode for. But it's quite the story and we certainly know why Captain Pike wants to get back to Talos IV and why the ever loyal Leonard Nimoy risks his career in Starfleet to help him.It certainly is one incredible odyssey for Jeffrey Hunter.",7
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Menagerie: Part II (TV Episode 1966)",A Worthy Conclusion,"As the first half ended, Spock asked to have the second tape played. He doesn't care if he is vindicated, only that his former Captain be given piece. We now focus on Jeffrey Hunter who was Kirk's counterpart in ""The Cage."" We are let in on the secret of his adventures on Talos IV. It is about an effort of a dying race of superbrains who need to repopulate the planet. They are able to create incredible illusions, offering Pike anything to mate and be the new Adam. Unfortunately, Starship Captains don't always go along with someone else's agenda. Beautiful women (illusions) are offered up but Pike wants to understand what is going on. The joy of this is that he thoughtfully unravels things. Not to spoil this, it really works. The conclusion is quite satisfying. This also is Leonard Nimoy's opportunity to get beyond the ""weird looking guy with the pointy ears."" I recommend this.",9
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Menagerie: Part II (TV Episode 1966)","Good story, but a bit unexplained","""The Cage"", the original and unaired pilot for this series, was a great episode. The episode didn't go to waste, as the producers found a way to 'splice' most of that episode into a two-part story, ""The Menagerie"". This story has one of the best and most uplifting endings of any Star Trek episode-- a way is found to help a crippled officer live a (relatively) normal life.Having seen ""The Cage"", I learned there are some parts that were deleted for this version, including the memorable line that ""Number One"" (Majel Barrett) has secret fantasies about Captain Pike! That was one of my favorite lines that didn't make it to this version.There's a fair amount of padding in these two episodes to make them ""fit"" into a two-episode slot, but that was reasonably well done. The fiction of the court-martial doesn't quite make sense, but it served its dramatic purpose of creating tension and consuming time.Unfortunately, I felt like I had to downgrade the episode somewhat due to one major problem with the story: the total failure to explain just WHY the Talosians would want to help Pike. In the original ""Cage"" script, of course, Pike never got crippled and never returned to Talos, so there was no need for any such explanation. And it's pretty hard to come up with a reason that they would help him.What did they get out of it? Why would they suddenly be benevolent and helpful to a man who was now totally incapable of producing any children? Not to mention the fact that Vina was probably in her 50's by that point and past childbearing age (an ""adult"" when she crash landed, as stated by Number One; 18 years before Pike first met her, which was 13 years prior to the events of ""The Menagerie""). And the Talosians didn't seem particularly ""altruistic"" nor did they owe any debt to Pike; just the opposite. It is rather difficult to think of a rationale for the Talosians to act in that way, which is probably why the writers didn't even try to fashion some excuse.",7
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Menagerie: Part II (TV Episode 1966)",The best of the best!,"Although there have already been some excellent positive reviews posted on this incredible episode, I wanted to express some of the profound impressions that it had made on me when I first viewed it on its mid- 70's syndicated run. Rather than a point for point review, I wanted to share some rather random, subliminal, and long lasting impressions that I had of this incredible show. First of all, I had never been so thrilled by a TV program before. After Menagerie Part 1 ended with ""to be continued"" caption, I could scarcely wait until the conclusion that would be offered in Part 2.Many of the mysterious events introduced in part one were beyond thrilling to my young mind. The Enterprise had been locked on course to the only ""forbidden planet"" in the galaxy; strange transmissions from Talos IV were creating images from 13 years ago of the Enterprise's first voyage to this strange world; Spock was on trial for mutiny; and what ""chance for life"" could the injured Capt. Pike possibly have on Talos? The look and feel of the ship and crew was familiar, but strikingly different. Pike's crew wore old style uniforms, had lasers in instead of phasers, the communicators were transparent, the landing party wore blue jackets, some approaching views of the Talos IV were shadowy like a waning moon, musical plants created the exterior planet sound heard in this and many subsequent episodes, the transporter sequence to beam down took much longer and flickered in and out quite a bit. The sound effects on the bridge and for the transporter were quite different too. Alexander Courage created a magnificent underscore for this episode. From the dreamlike ""Rigel 7"" musical queue to the very cool electronic music for the Talosians, this underscore was quite evocative. I'm assuming that the eerie electronic sound effect/music queue for when the Keeper's conversation (via the monitor screen) with Kirk ended was the creation of Courage too.I was impressed by the transitional effect for the illusion sequences and the appearance of the laser-holed transparency (both sight and sound) as well. The phlegmatic voice and the pulsing head veins of the Keeper were unforgettable too.After Vina's revelation toward the end, there is a very strong feeling of having seen a Greek tragedy on screen. As the briefing room darkens one last time, on the monitor screen, Kirk views Capt. Pike and Vina hand-in-hand back on Talos. The Keeper intones ""Captain Pike has an illusion and you have reality, may you find your way as pleasant"". The dreamlike music is achingly moving, and the marvelous story concludes with romantic, yet bittersweet feeling, and a sense of awe.",10

10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Menagerie: Part II (TV Episode 1966)","""You can have whatever dream you want"".","Getting up to speed on the early history of the series, I find it interesting that the network powers that be at the time rejected the early pilot for 'Star Trek' because it was too cerebral. It calls to mind the same thinking on the part of the liberal and media elite today that believes the average citizen is just too dumb to understand what's best for us, and find it their obligation to promote social programs and policies against the will of the people. I generally don't like to bring politics into my film reviews, but Part II of 'The Menagerie' is just loaded with this type of symbolism, perhaps Gene Roddebberry's best shot at those who stood in the way of his vision and creativity. I was particularly taken with the method of the (elitist) Talosians, paraphrasing here - 'Wrong thinking is punishable, right thinking will be as quickly rewarded'.Considering the era, and also considering the fact that this was TV, Part II of 'The Menagerie' is a triumph of sci-fi entertainment. The idea that Commodore Mendez' (Malachi Throne) presence on the shuttlecraft and The Enterprise was all an illusion was a brilliant stroke. Done as a tactic to counter Captain Kirk's force of will went to further establish Kirk's character as a strong and forceful leader, immune to appeasement when confronted by a challenge. The same was true of Captain Pike's (Jeffrey Hunter) leadership; by inviting death instead of giving up his personal freedom and liberty, he threw a cosmic curve ball at the Talosians who didn't know how to deal with this dilemma.Then you have Spock, who's closing exchange with Kirk is a thoughtful dialog on the the topic of emotionalism versus logic. It would set the stage for future episodes, many of which would have to be dealt with on the basis of sound reasoning instead of irrational fear or succumbing to the unknown. Quite a remarkable accomplishment for a show almost a half century old now, the stories growing richer and more vibrant with the passage of time.",9

In fact that discussion mirrors one Bones had with Kirk in Star Trek II, and it is also most probably the basis of bringing Woopi Goldberg in to The Next Generation to be a Bartender and ""A Listener"".But to visit Talos IV is the only Death Penalty on Starfleet's Books, Spock not only jeopardizes himself but Kirk as well.They have the ability to create Illusions for anyone they come in contact with, and this is why their planet is off limits. At least Starfleet thought this was the only solution 13 years prior to when this happened.But now we see evidence that Galactic Distances are not a deterrent for their power. In fact the whole second part of this is a trick, a trick for Captain Kirk's benefit, for Spock's benefit, and mostly for Pike's.They had their eyes on Pike 13 years ago, and that focus never wavered- They still want him, it seems that The Talosians did not need any Human, they needed Pike, Pike was the only one that could do what they needed him to do. Because he was the kind of man Vina wanted, the only man in the galaxy for her, despite the ruin of her body.And Vina is apparently still there. It really doesn't matter what a person looks like, or even what they can or can't do. What is most important is what's in their Heart, and The Talosians are the only ones who can do anything for Pike- And for Vina.But the Vital Pike was not ready to do this in the 13 year old Video The Talosians are transmitting, he fights them, tries to keep them out of his mind by keeping violent thoughts. And he fails, this is where Vina gives the Facepalm.Now that I have seen The Cage several times on its own, and The Menagerie a few times, what makes it is not just The Cage on its own, it is The Cage being Inserted into the Framing Story of The Menagerie that makes it a much better story.And the Style of The Cage is Early 60's while The Menagerie is late 60's, actually The Cage was filmed in 50's Cinematic Style, this is what made it look like one was 13 years earlier than the other.Watching these today is almost like watching Tom Paris from Voyager's ""Captain Proton"" serials- This is how The Future was envisioned in the 60's- You'll see that Spocks' Library Computer Station was controlled by Hand Gestures.In 2013, there are now hand devices that can be operated with hand movements, computers that have Touch Screens, even ""Communicators"" that are not much larger than those on this show, some of them even flip open. And today, four years later... We have iPhones that are face- unlocked and gesture operated, powerful hand-computers and communicators. And the Wand Company even made WORKING Communicators.Would we have thought of these things without Trek?",10

We learn what the Talosians were really wanting and why they captured Pike. In the end, all is explained including the strange behavior of Mr. Spock.The second part of this episode is good... but not quite as good as the first part to me - but almost.

13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Menagerie: Part II (TV Episode 1966)",Too much reliance on The Cage,"I think that they really missed an opportunity here. I think that they could have easily aired The Cage as it was originally with a short explanation that it was going to give a bit of information about Spock's past. They could have done a couple of show with that premise, the first being The Cage and the second one a continuation showing how Spock got to be aboard the Enterprise with Kirk.Then, they could have done The Menagerie (although I still do not really understand the title) parts 1 and 2 but using a lot less of The Cage and more new content. I realize that they were trying to find a way to use that original pilot which never actually got to be used as a pilot, but had they done it as I suggested, it would have worked fine plus they would have had more episodes altogether.It would have been nice if a bit more had been explained as to how the Talosians knew that Captain Pike had been injured, how they were able to make contact with Spock, and why they even wanted to have Pike back.Aside from the fact that they used too much The Cage footage and not enough new content, it was still a good episode. The acting was done well and the little twists were nice. It also ended on a very happy note.",7
14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Menagerie: Part II (TV Episode 1966)",and i agreed with her reasons..,"Star TrekThe Menagerie: Part 2A cultural hub and by far one of the most loved and respected tale, Star Trek is created by Gene Roddenberry who wrote this brilliant concept, ahead of its time and is probably why it still doesn't fail to entertain us after these many years. It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. Unlike any other hit series, it only has 3 seasons so luckily it means that they will be covering up all their ideas within it until they are satisfied. As it often happens, the first season is always promising and has potential (or else it won't lift up for further more seasons) in it and is utilized with fine detailed work like focusing on different new breeds and characters bonding through this journey.The court room drama holds the viewers till the end for the flashback spends too much of its time on creating the dreams (they could have edited it better) and illusions but still it was for better and more importantly unpredictable than what we have encountered before.",
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Menagerie: Part II (TV Episode 1966)",Pike's Return to Talos IV,"Part two of ""The Menagerie"" picks up where the last episode left off, with Spock relaying the original interaction with the Talosians and Pike's captivity. Kirk, Pike, and Mendez must decide whether Spock is guilty of treason as the Enterprise continues towards Talos IV and more of the story becomes clearer to the tribunal.Having Pike in his current state really is genius. It gives the Enterprise a reason to go to Talos IV and it explains why Pike is unable to explain the situation in any capacity.This episode has a lot of recycled footage, even reusing the Pike shot when the Talosians create a fake mate for Vina. Now of course, this is Pike in the flesh and the two human outcast can live out the rest of their lived together, enjoying each other's company and beauty.The ending of this is a bit clunky. Everything gets wrapped up in about 20 seconds and no new footage of the Talosians or the planet's surface is seen. I know it wasn't feasible since Jeffrey Hunter was unable to shoot more scenes but I would have enjoyed something new besides a voiceover directed at Kirk from the Keeper. I was a bit less impressed by part 2 than by part 1. The setup was very strong but the finale felt a bit forced and truncated. I still enjoyed the overall story arc and the (happy?) ending that Pike gets living within his dreams.",7
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Conscience of the King (TV Episode 1966)",Is He Kodos the Executioner or just an Actor?,"This is another example of a Trek episode where Capt. Kirk temporarily abandons his usual mission (exploring) and goes off on a personal vendetta (see the recent ""Dagger of the Mind"" and the much later ""Obsession"") - but it's very personal in this one. On the surface, it may seem trivial because larger questions concerning the galaxy are placed aside, but we become very involved in Kirk's private quest here. The episode is basically a mystery: is a traveling Shakespearean actor just what he seems to be or is he really the ex-governor of a failed colony, where, 20 years earlier, 4000 people had been put to death on his orders? We are left guessing for most of the episode. Will this turn out to be a false quest, a morality tale on the pitfalls of revenge? Or will this suspect truly be revealed as a mass murderer, causing Kirk to phaser him into oblivion? This episode also has an interesting set design for a futuristic house on another planet and a nice rendition of a song 'Beyond Antares' by Uhura (Nichols).I would think guest star Moss had a field day with his role in this one; his specialty in real life were Shakespearean plays. He acts out Macbeth here, the story of which carries eerie parallels to the character he plays in this episode, and Hamlet, which parallels scenes in the actual episode. His voice is magnetic and his confrontation scene with Kirk as they parry verbally remains one of the better ones during this Trek season. Anderson, as his daughter, also holds her own in a strangely beautiful role. The episode is filled with nice touches - catch the very brief one as Yeoman Rand (Whitney) passes Anderson's character in the turbolift. It's also telling that Spock, for all his usual annoyance with McCoy, runs to him when he notices the captain being edgy again. There's a key scene with Kirk, Spock and McCoy which sums up this trinity's relationship. Finally, we have Riley (Hyde) back again in his second and last appearance (after ""The Naked Time""). It's an ironic form of justice that Riley ends up demoted to the lower decks in the engine room, where he caused all that trouble in his previous appearance. A rather haunting conclusion caps this foray into space intrigue.",7
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Conscience of the King (TV Episode 1966)",Quite a strange episode,"I had mixed feelings about this episode. It featured some strong and memorable performances, particularly from the two main guest stars, Arnold Moss and Barbara Anderson, and a somewhat interesting and unexpected twist near the end.But it's not really a ""Star Trek"" episode. It's really more of a mundane mystery that has nothing to do with science fiction. The episode leaves a very odd, kind of hollow feeling afterward. This has got to be one of the least entertaining episodes of the series; it's actually quite a downer, and there doesn't seem to be any useful ""lesson"" to extract, either. Sort of an exercise in artistic pointlessness-- good performances in the services of a sort of 'dead' affair.MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW: Basically, Kirk pursues a personal vendetta against a man who may or may not be a notorious historical figure who committed mass murder, though under unusual circumstances. It becomes all too obvious early on that the man at issue is indeed the same as the historical figure, yet Kirk stubbornly refuses to accept the facts (Spock is quite right here, and even McCoy grudgingly supports Spock). The plot is complicated by the fact that Kirk is infatuated with the man's 19 year old daughter.But in the end, nearly everyone ""loses"". This was one of the most negative episodes of the series. The historical figure dies-- but at the hands of the one person who loves him. Arguably he deserved to die, but not like that. Because of his stubborn refusal to accept the facts, Kirk puts both himself and another crew member (Lt. Riley) needlessly at risk and almost costs Riley his life.But the most unsettling part was the convincing nature of Barbara Anderson's psychopathic character. Basically, she needlessly brings destruction on herself, her father, and on the only surviving eyewitnesses of the massacre. Good, but very unsettling acting job; she's a bit too convincing as a nutcase.The whole thing seems a little pointless by the end. The historical figure could have faded into obscurity, yet he chose a career (actor) that necessarily exposed him to a broad array of audiences. Somehow, he utterly fails to keep his dark past a secret from his daughter, yet she too is inadvertently corrupted (a bad seed? If so, strange idea for a Stark Trek episode). Kirk gets his ""vengeance"", but it feels thoroughly hollow, as the man is essentially harmless and remorseful now, and the daughter is destroyed as well in the process.By the end, I thought to myself, why is this a Star Trek episode? I know that Gene Roddenberry liked to explore non-scifi issues, but this one just seemed like an exercise in unpleasantness. There doesn't seem to be any lesson here. I suppose Kirk achieves one slightly positive end-- he stops the insane daughter from killing again-- but it just doesn't feel like much of a victory by the end.",4
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Conscience of the King (TV Episode 1966)","""All the ghosts are dead, I've buried them"".","Well if nothing else, this episode of Star Trek advanced the reputation of Captain Kirk as an intergalactic Romeo. Did you catch Lenore Karidian's (Barbara Anderson) remark to the Captain while assessing The Enterprise - ""All this power surging and throbbing, yet under control"". Whoa! - where were the censors on that one? - especially when she followed it up with ""Are you like that, Captain""? Can I get a look at the outtakes from this episode? They must have been hilarious! It's almost enough to take your mind off the story. Yet here you had a classic treatment of the 'justice versus vengeance' theme, with Kirk treading that fine line between getting revenge on a mass murderer and seeing to it that the guilty is satisfactorily dealt with and punished in accordance with law. The nifty twist of course is that the subsequent murders of the witnesses to Kodos the Executioner's (Arnold Moss) crimes were carried out by his daughter. The story nicely strung you along expecting her to be an unknowing participant with the Shakespearean troupe.What would have made the story more absorbing I think, would have been to explore further Karidian's actions in the past. There was a tease of that with the hasty explanation of a dwindling food supply and Karidian backed into a corner to eradicate half of his colony. The seed of a greater psychological drama was planted here, though hardly one that could have been dealt with in an hour long format. Karidian's horror when learning of his daughter's actions sent a message that here was a complex man who spent the rest of his life agonizing over his past actions.",7
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Conscience of the King (TV Episode 1966)",Kirk as Hamlet,"The use of Shakespearean motifs in the original series is hardly unique, but The Conscience of the King is perhaps the best use of the metaphor, with Shatner making Kirk an impressive quasi-Hamlet.The episode begins with Kirk and old friend Thomas Leighton watching a performance of Macbeth, and the friend telling Kirk that lead actor Anton Karidian is, in fact, Kodos the Executioner, who massacred several thousand colonists decades earlier. Because Kirk and Leighton are two of only nine witnesses who could positively identify Kodos, Leighton asks for Kirk's help in proving the case. Kirk is dubious, but when Leighton is murdered, Kirk takes it upon himself to make the determination of whether Karidian is guilty of these crimes.To my mind, Hamlet is often misinterpreted as a play about, as Olivier stated in his Oscar-winning adaptation, a man who could not make up his mind -- in fact, it is a play about an intelligent, well-educated and sophisticated man who must have definitive proof of guilt before reaching judgment and imposing justice (and, by the time he does have it, he is unable to impose true justice until the climax of the play). ""The Conscience of the King"" follows this same pattern, with Kirk taking on the Hamlet role, Karidian as Claudius, his daughter as Ophelia, and (ironically) Spock bouncing between Polonius and Horatio (though McCoy also fills the latter role part of the time).The result is fairly impressive. Barry Trivers' script nicely parallels the Enterprise's crew with the court at Elsinore, and creates some nicely suspenseful moments, and Gerd Oswald's direction shows that he knows exactly how far to go with the theatricality of the story, without making it visually static (one nice touch is the shot of Karidian, just before Kirk meets with him, standing behind a screen that looks eerily like a confessional, mirroring Claudius' confession in Act III, Sc. IV).As for the performances, Shatner provides a nuanced and shaded performance, balancing his primal need for justice/revenge with the doubts presented by what is, at best, sketchy evidence -- it's a dynamic the series repeated several times, but rarely so well (thanks in large part to the best dramatic template of this type of conflict ever written). As Karidian, Arnold Moss is excellent, being given the chance to show off his Shakespearean chops, while at the same time being given a complicated moral conundrum to underline his backstory -- a conflict that he uses to optimal effect. Nimoy and Kelley are also strong in their respective roles in this drama, and Bruce Hyde is given some nice moments in repeating his role as Kevin Reilly (from ""The Naked Time""), as another witness to Kodos' horrors.If there is one weakness, it is Barbara Anderson's performance as Karidian's daughter and co-star, though to be fair, whether it is her or the script is hard to know. She is presented two-dimensionally, which makes the finale far less effective that it could have been. As a result, an episode that could have ranked with the top five of the series instead ranks as one of the top ten.Well worth the time.",9
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Conscience of the King (TV Episode 1966)",Acting takes center stage over special effects,"Some of the best episodes in Trek history were not those that featured space battles or alien races, but were the ones that were character-driven, laced with social commentary. ""The Conscience of the King"" is a good example of the latter. Arnold Moss guests as the respected lead actor in a Shakespearean troupe, visiting the Enterprise and providing much-needed performances for the crew. Suspicians arise that he may just be a war criminal. When on-board murders occur, Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) must find the perpetrator, but also answer the mystery about the actor. Barbara Anderson, who would later win an Emmy for her supporting role on TV's ""Ironside"", plays Moss's daughter, devoted and determined to not let anything or anyone destroy the image of her beloved father.Considering that Shakespeare provides the backdrop for the episode, Shatner, known for his occasional over-the-top acting, is rather restrained this time, which adds to the beauty of this dialog-laden installment. Moss and Anderson are fantastic in their respective roles as actors playing actors.Almost thirty years later, ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"", the offspring of the original, would offer a similar story of the is-he-or-isn't-he-a-war-criminal theme in the excellent ""Duet"" installment.",8
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Conscience of the King (TV Episode 1966)",Shakespeare in Space,"This episode is... interesting. A friend of Kirk's recognizes a former despot responsible for killing off half an Earth colony and who is now presumed dead. The friend wants this man, now under the guise of a Shakespearen actor, brought to justice but dies soon after under mysterious circumstances. Kirk is only one of 2 living witnesses who can identify Kodos the Executioner. But is this actor really him?There are a few things that either I don't understand about the plot or I think are far too convenient. 1) Why is Kirk necessary as an eyewitness? They have pictures of both men on record. Facial recognition technology should be able to handle this without finicky human memories. If mankind has the technology to match voice patterns, even when you try to disguise it, to verify a voice, facial matching should be accessible. 2) Dr. McCoy's choice to log his entry with Riley next door within earshot was extremely idiotic. This conveniently allows Riley to seek vengeance, a plotline that never really goes anywhere. The plot of this episode feels more like an Agatha Christie novel in space opera form more than your standard TOS episode. The shot of the unidentified hand spraying poison into the milk feels almost comical. Arnold Moss is good in his role (besides an abysmal line reading of ""I am tired!"") and Barbara Anderson is serviceable as his daughter. The reveal at the end of Lenore's plans to wipe out witnesses to protect her father adds a little life to the episode but it feels like too little too late. This doesn't ever feel like a sci-fi episode, just a whodunnit plot set on the Enterprise.Note: I am sad to see this is Rand's last appearance on the show. Her character leaves with a bit of a shrug. I wish that problems on set had not caused her departure.",6
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Conscience of the King (TV Episode 1966)",Hamlet and Nazi war crimes,"I really wasn't sure what to call this review, so I figured I'd just call it what I thought the whole thing was about.What we have here is a classic criminal investigation using a theatrical technique to recreate the theme of whatever crime it was that was committed. The idea is to get the suspect/perpetrator to emotionally connect with their alleged criminal act. The concept is an old one. The astute viewer, particularly one familiar with Shakespeare (Edward de Vere's works) will note Hamlet's ""the play's the thing..."" concept, and how said notion is cleverly injected into this episode.Most of the episode is a murder mystery a-la a PBS episode with Diana Rigg. But, unlike WGBH's production, we're not given hints nor clues as to who is doing what. It's part of the ingenuity of this episode as the audience is shown apparent evidence for inferred correlation. As such the audience isn't really challenged to figure out who is doing what, but presented a twist without realizing it.The theme is lifted from the criminal investigations that continue to this very day as of this writing, concerning the heinous acts of mass murder by the Nazi regime prior to the ending of the second world war. What is stronger? Peronsal ties or societal obligation? And what are the personal ramifications on a personal basis when two sets of right and wrong collide? Can anyone, so divided, exist and retain their sanity? This episode explores those themes, and offers a possible outcome. It is an interesting exploration, and an interesting writing exercise.A respectable episode. Enjoy.",
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Conscience of the King (TV Episode 1966)",Barbara Anderson's Show,"Much the same as I would do with Doris Day, after growing up watching her TV show, then seeing her in The Man Who KNew Too Much, I thought 'this is the same woman?' This is how I would regard Barbara Anderson. First I would see her in a Halloween episode of The Love Boat, totally fixated on her looks (the way she behaves, you would believe she thought since she was beautiful on the outside, she MUST be beautiful on the inside as well, and when she is scarred . . . . !) and later I would see a childhood movie, Don't Be Afraid of The Dark, 1971, with Kim Darby.I don't know what she did on Ironside to win an Emmy, but when I would watch this episode of Star Trek, I never for the life of me knew it was Barbara Anderson, the same woman from that awful episode of Love Boat and Don't Be Afraid of the Dark.When the revelation takes place, Anderson runs with it, with all the conviction possible. In everything I have ever seen this woman in, she stopped at beauty, but here, she was different.How incredibly odd as well, that of everything I've mentioned, Love Boat, Afraid of the Dark, Ironside, she would do this ST episode first! I've since seen her in an episode of Mannix, I think; she acted pretty heavily in that one.None compare to the guts of Star Trek.Anyone who thinks Star Trek, TOS, is only known for its barbie doll women is viewing the show as superficially as one would view Barbara Anderson while only focusing on her looks.There's more there.",10
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Conscience of the King (TV Episode 1966)","Not an episode I liked as a kid, but now probably one of the better ones","You know, as a child of 8 or so, this was definitely an episode I never liked and especially after it was later shown on KCOP in Los Angeles with all the great bits cut out (Uhuru's wonderful song, for example), commercials every 5 minutes, etc., it just was not done justice.Now, seeing it all these years later, it is definitely one of the better episodes. It's great as a college-educated adult (as opposed to a snot-nosed kid) to see the structure of the story and the parallels to MacBeth and Hamlet. An especially interesting scene, I think, is the one where Kirk is trying to prevent the only other witness to the mass murder from murdering the executioner, arguing philosophically, Shakespearan, with the young man, behind the curtain where the real play is being carried out. A wonderful small bit there.There are other great bits in this episode too including details about music, food, clothes, housing and other very imaginative bits of the 23rd century. Seems like they really took their time with this episode, setting up the scenery as well as the plot.And, of course, this show had some of the most incredibly psychedelic colors in the whole series. Oh, 1966! In the scene where Kirk first meets Lenore, she is wearing a cobalt blue dress, Kirk has a bright yellow tunic, there are forest greens and pinks and all sorts of wild colors splashed all over the walls. The whole episode is like this! Wonderful.The intricate structure of this episode owes so much to Gerd Oswald, the director. A great TV director of that era, who directed among other things some of the best episodes of the old Outer Limits show (14 episodes in total, among them the Harlan Ellison-authored ""Soldier"").The one sour note I thought was Barbara Anderson's performance. Seemed like that scenery at the end must have had quite a few holes in it! She was very pretty though and wore some great clothes! TV Land is showing Star Trek every morning. They have done a wonderful job with this. Seems like most everything in the original NBC viewing is in there (ok, maybe 1 extra commercial break somewhere in the hour) and the prints are great.I definitely recommend this episode for viewing because you may too have thought this was one of the lamer ones but if you watch it now as an adult, it's pretty darn good.",8

Karidian (Arnold Moss) is performing Macbeth when Kirk's former acquaintance (William Sargent) claims he's Kodos, the Executioner. Kirk investigates, becoming more passionate about it when Sargent is found dead...a half face mask on Sargent was an example of the terror left behind Kodos. Kodos was supposedly dead, burnt alive on the very planet he sent many to die, using eugenics to decide who he believes should live or die, as a food shortage/fungus provoked him to action. Kirk and later Spock who decides to monitor the captain's actions out of concern realize that those nine folks who know what Kodos looks like are being killed one by one, eerily happening in locations of the troupe's performances. With only two left, Kirk and his Enterprise officer, Riley (Bruce Hyde, last seen in his memorable supporting part in The Naked Time), are soon to be targets... particularly since Kirk invites the troupe on-board his ship! Riley's entire family was killed by Kodos, and he nearly died from poisoned milk, recovering with vengeance on the mind. Barbara Anderson is Lenore, Karidian's daughter, of whom Kirk becomes romantic. Anderson is initially this photographically soft lit lovely, but the conclusion offers a chilling madness as her father's fate seems threatened. Lots of use of Shakespeare gives this a unique feel, a bit atypical of this Trek series. Kirk butts heads with Spock over his investigation, but the captain relents that he's unsure if getting an answer about Karidian will result in seeking revenge or seeing that an annihilator is brought to justice for his crimes. Ultimately Kirk does the right thing, preventing an anguished Riley from ruining his career. Moss is more of a factor towards the end as Kirk assertively questions him, taking his vocal tenor for analysis. Moss effectively shows underlying guilt and shame while attempting to hide his past under a persona that is beginning to erode. Cool chance to see the observation deck in this one while Kirk takes Lenore on a walk through the Enterprise... Shatner truly conveys Kirk's blossoming fondness for her, choosing later when asked by Bones if he really cared about her not to comment. Disappointment in another failed romance is right there on Kirk, quite obvious.",7

12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Conscience of the King (TV Episode 1966)",Excellent Star trek entry,"So interestingly enough as I go along through life the episodes of Star Trek I enjoy the most are not the ones I treasured during my watching, rewatching, and re-rewatching of the first series. This one now seems quite fine. Moss plays a traveling Shakespearean actor who might or might not be Kodos the Executioner, a planetary governor who eliminated half a colony to stave off mass starvation 20 years before, and now thought dead. Kirk becomes enmeshed in the mystery and despite concerns by Spock as to his priorities seems determined to learn the truth. There are a few problems - like how was a young Kirk on Tarsus IV and how come only nine living people can identify Kodos, but if you can put those sorts of things aside this is fun stuff. In retrospect they could have done better with a few more of these personal dramas than with some of the later half-baked plots. Kirk, Spock and McCoy agonize and quibble back and forth to a satisfying conclusion, good stuff.",9

14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Conscience of the King (TV Episode 1966)",Every great TV series has a clunker...,"Having watched all of the Star Trek TV series episodes many times each since the 1960s, most being quite good to superb, and only very few being mediocre, my opinion is that this one is the worst of all.In fact, I think it's so poorly executed as to be an embarrassment to the series. It's not that the story is so bad, although it's not particularly outstanding in any way, but the acting is just abysmal on the part of the two lead characters, meaning those other than the regulars in this case. Barbara Anderson gives her weakest performance ever as the daughter of a mass killer, and who is on a mission of a sort. She practically calls in the role from a phone, and shows no real emotive abilities here. Although usually she's never used as more than a pretty face in most of her film/TV roles,usually small parts, she has done much better.Arnold Moss as her father gives new meaning to the term 'Ham' and is the only actor ever on a 1960s Star Trek episode that outdid William Shatner in this area, and actually makes Shatner look superb by comparison. And he gets to play a Shakespearian actor no less, which gives him more impetus to overact, and he does so.Other than these two leads being so weak, the story is such that anybody with any sense at all can tell who the killer is within the first 15 minutes. I say this because I told my brother the whole plot ending at the first commercial break when we were watching the original 1966 broadcast as pre-teens. His reply was, Yeah, you're right.Skip this one and watch the much superior Menagerie episodes which were originally televised right before.",

As a kid I never questioned it, but she was right--the guy was supposedly disfigured by Kodos and instead of finding a decent plastic surgeon, they just stick a giant black patch on half his face! Apart from this silliness, this actually is a decent and watchable episode. And, as usual, Kirk spends much of the episode chasing a lovely young lady and trying to woo her--I guess SOMEBODY's gotta do it.The episode involves the hunt for Kodos--a pragmatic but amoral governor who apparently ordered the execution of half his settlement in order to assure that the rest could survive famine! And, the worst of it is after the executions, help unexpectedly arrived! Well, the film begins with Mr. Blackpatch meeting with Kirk to tell him he thinks he's identified the real Kodos--who has been at large and wanted for years by the authorities. Well, soon Patchy is murdered and it seems someone--perhaps Kodos--is trying to kill anyone who can identify him.The episode isn't a particularly strong one though it is quite enjoyable and watchable.",7
16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Conscience of the King (TV Episode 1966)",My Point of View,I am going to review a different angle on this episode. Costumes and hairstyles. This is just a fabulous episode for those of us into fashion. The mini mini skirts and glittering hosiery. The tall tall hair styles achieved with many hair pieces. Fur and jewels on men and woman. And those mod mod prints that hint at Pucci as the designer. The sixties had a space age feel to fashion so it has a great futuristic feel to it while being very much still the sixties. Another part of the plot that I liked especially well was having Spock at the forefront of the plot. He is baffled by the captains behavior and starts to unravel the mystery. I think Spock was at his best in this. Of course I am a huge mystery fan so this episode appealed in that aspect. And it should be mentioned that Uhuru sings a strange spacey song while playing her autoharp like instrument.The glorious color of this episode was a special treat too as I saw these episodes in black and white originally. That violet sky was a great touch.,7
17,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Conscience of the King (TV Episode 1966)",Better left on the cutting room floor...,"A dreadful Enterprise outing. A really dull story poorly told. Guest star Barbara Anderson over acts her way through this story...or was she simply over acting as the actor's talentless actress daughter? We get the chance to see again, Lt Kevin Thomas O'Reilly....'demoted' to auxiliary control (after his nearly destroying the ship at the planet Psi having turned the engines off, I'm surprised Kirk would trust him!) and a poisoning kitchen gloved hand spraying machine oil into his glass of milk. Sad because he's alone, life gets worse for him when Nichelle Nichols starts 'singing'....surely a fate worse than poisoning!! So we get a dull story line with little real action...then Uhura warbling...it doesn't get much worse than that. Those are the stand out moments for me...and that says it all for this episode.",

I was surprised how familiar Lt Uhura's song was, and how haunting. Kirk is in a tight spot in this episode, when falsely diverted to a planet out of his way. There was a famine induced genocide some 20 years ago and an actor in a traveling troupe bears a striking resemblance to that evil dictator. His daughter is a beautiful young woman. Although Kirk seems to be under the spell of this attractive woman, as usual, it seems he may be trying to get closer to her to get at the truth about her father.The troupe beams up on a pretext and Spock is suspicious. Kirk refuses to tell him what is going on, but Spock takes a handful of clues, puts them together and figures out the situation. Interesting ending with an unanticipated climax scene. Ethical dilemmas abound.",8
19,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Conscience of the King (TV Episode 1966)",A killer or an actor?,"Captain Kirk is not pleased when he diverts the Enterprise only to learn that the reason given was untrue. Dr. Leighton and claimed to have discovered a new artificial food source but in reality he wanted to tell Kirk that he believes an actor, Anton Karidian, currently visiting the planet is actually a man who committed mass-murder many years before. Kodos 'the Executioner' had been the governor of a Federation colony and he had ordered the deaths of half the population when the food supplies starting running out; he was also presumed dead even though his burnt body was never formally identified. Kirk initially doesn't believe Leighton's theory but looks into in anyway and discovers that there is no record of Karidian prior to Kosos' death. When Leighton is killed he starts to believe that Karidian might really be Kodos so arranges for the actor, his daughter and the rest of their troupe to be transported to their next destination on the Enterprise. Spock starts to think the captain is making some irrational decisions and finds out about his enquiries; he discovers that of the witnesses to Kodos crime seven have been murdered while Kodos was in the area and two more are on the Enterprise; Lt Riley and Capt. Kirk! While Kirks suspicions of Karidian grow attempts are made on both his life and that of Riley.This is a rather different episode as it takes the form of a mystery; initially we have no idea whether or not Karidian is really Kodos and when we learn that he is we see that he isn't quite the monster he appeared to be his actions were inexcusable but they were taken to save the entire colony from starvation and he clearly feels guilt for what he did unlike the person trying to kill the witnesses who emerges as insane. The fact that Kirk was attracted to his daughter was somewhat cliché but by now if he hadn't he'd have been acting out of character. The Shakespearian elements of the plot nicely mirrored the plays that Karidian and his troupe performed. The ending has a nice twist and a suitable degree of tragedy. The cast do a solid job; especially guest stars Arnold Moss who plays the tortured Karidian/Kodos and Barbara Anderson who plays his daughter; she is utterly convincing as her insanity is revealed. Overall this episode turned out much better than I expected.",8
20,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Conscience of the King (TV Episode 1966)",Shakespearean on many levels,"This always has been one of my favorite episodes. The obvious Shakespearean references aside, this episode provides an interesting view of Kirk-as-Hamlet. Like Hamlet, Kirk is faced with a murderer, but is unable to take decisive action to apprehend him until it is too late. Fortunately, unlike Hamlet, Kirk's vacillation costs Caridian his life, rather than Kirk's own.The episode has a number of nice touches--Janice Rand's glance at Lenore Karidian as the latter leaves the bridge (in Rand's last appearance on the show)--comes to mind very quickly, but it also has a sour note or two. When Spock questions Kirk's decision to allow the acting company to travel with the Enterprise, McCoy too readily attributes it to Kirk's attraction to Lenore; the doctor should be a bit more professional than that. In addition, Riley seems to give up too easily when confronted by Kirk.",8
21,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Conscience of the King (TV Episode 1966)",has the machine changed him..,"Star TrekThe Conscience Of The KingA cultural hub and by far one of the most loved and respected tale, Star Trek is created by Gene Roddenberry who wrote this brilliant concept, ahead of its time and is probably why it still doesn't fail to entertain us after these many years. It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. Unlike any other hit series, it only has 3 seasons so luckily it means that they will be covering up all their ideas within it until they are satisfied. As it often happens, the first season is always promising and has potential (or else it won't lift up for further more seasons) in it and is utilized with fine detailed work like focusing on different new breeds and characters bonding through this journey.Revisiting the Macbeth tale and recreating it almost in a way should have had better writing to support this genius idea but instead it spends its time on building up to its last dramatic act which not only is predictable but a bit overlong too.",

0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Balance of Terror (TV Episode 1966)",The Face of War - and it's Romulan!,"When the Romulans come, they will not be bearing gifts; no, they bring with them war - war and conquest. As any familiar with this episode know, it is a redux of the war film ""The Enemy Below"" from the fifties. The obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine (or an American Destroyer & German U-boat) engaged in lethal war games, it is two starships in outer space. In Trek history, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, Earth fought the Romulan Wars. After about 5 years of conflict, a stalemate brought about a treaty and the institution of the Neutral Zone, a boundary between us and the Romulan Empire. Now, on this stardate, the treaty appears to be broken, as our outposts are being attacked and destroyed by some weapon of immense power. Yes, the Romulans are back, testing their new war toy, and Kirk must now earn his pay: he must make decisions that would affect this sector of the galaxy, such as figuring out how to avoid a...oh, I dunno - an interstellar war, maybe? I think what makes this episode so effective is that it doesn't shy away from the grim aspects of war, as one would expect of a mere TV episode from the sixties - especially an episode from a science fiction show. It's all very tense and gripping, like the best war films, such as when Kirk sits down with his key officers for what amounts to a war council. The writers and the actors aren't kidding around here: this is all preparation for a ghastly conflict, potentially the beginning of another years-long battleground. In the final analysis, Kirk's aim is to keep this battleground to just the two ships - but even then it's an endeavor fraught with peril and probable casualties. In fact, I believe this episode holds the record for ship casualties by the end of it. Right at the start of the episode, we see the devastation such battle can produce, in that supposedly well-protected outpost. Then begin the cat-and-mouse war games between the Enterprise and the Romulan ship - it's as exciting as any conflict we've seen on the big screen. Of course, if you're not into war films, you'd have to look for other things to admire in this episode.What elevates this episode even further is the revelation of just what and who the Romulans are - it's an electric shock of a sort. Now we have even further inter-crew conflict on the bridge of the Enterprise - war does tend to bring out the worst in some people. Due to still nasty attitudes about race in this future, the tension is ratcheted up even further - Kirk has his hands full in this one. I suppose the one weakness in the story is the convenient relenting of the bigotry issue by the conclusion. On the Romulan side, actor Lenard makes his first appearance in the Trek universe as the Romulan commander; he's terrific in the role, the flip side of Capt. Kirk or Capt. Pike, take your pick, done up to resemble Spock more than a little. Surprisingly, his character is not war hungry as we would expect, another eye-opener for this episode. The actor would next return to this universe as Sarek, Spock's father, so he's nothing if not versatile. It's also telling how the first appearance of such characters as the Romulans is usually their best shot, as it is here. They showed up in ""The Enterprise Incident"" next.",9
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Balance of Terror (TV Episode 1966)",Episodes like this one are what makes Star Trek great!,"This has to be one of my 3 favorite Episodes from the Original TV Series.What makes it great is the battle of wits between The Romulan Commander and Kirk, as well as the top-notch acting from Mark Lenard, who later went on to play Spock's father in other TV Episodes and movies. This is a case where those around rose to the level of the talent around them, and Shatner, Nimoy, and the whole cast deliver an outstanding performance in this episode.The writing and plot are also excellent, and I love the direct approach used to show us the characters, and the feelings and thoughts of those characters, and how freely they are expressed by the actors. This very entertaining episode ranks 10 out of 10. AWESOME!! Desert-Buddha",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Balance of Terror (TV Episode 1966)",Great Episode Where The Performances Make You Forget the Flaws,"Let's get the flaws out of the way. It relies really heavily on the ""Space is an Ocean"" trope. It takes the submarine movie in space bit way to far to where apparently sound can travel through space. Translating other genres to sci-fi is an age old concept, but you need to stray from the source where appropriate.Second is the internal conflict on the Enterprise. Styles is a guy we've never seen before and will never see again. He's supposed to be a bigot, but he's actually got a point, at first. If no one's seen a Romulan, how do you know they haven infiltrated the Federation? His focusing on Spock is a bit less forgivable, given his long Starfleet career and the fact that there's a planet full of Vulcans. However, while an earlier stardate, this episode actually originally aired a few weeks after ""The Menagerie"", so audiences at the time may have been more accepting of the idea of a Spock betrayal. Styles' attitude shift was a bit far-fetched, but not wholly unbelievable.Now let's get to what makes this episode ooze with awesome. The chess match between Kirk and The Romulan commander was awesome. It was a match between equals, each with advantages and disadvantages to deal with. I somewhat disagree with another reviewer who called this a clear good guy vs. bad guy scenario. While the Romulans are certainly the aggressors, The Commander and The Centurian are portrayed quite sympathetically. They're not wholly comfortable with their mission, but are experienced soldiers doing as ordered. Mark Lenard did a great job bringing out a brilliant, but somewhat tired old soldier. He got to make a classic line at the end that is really sums up how you feel about his conflict with Kirk,""CAPTAIN, I REGRET THAT WE MEET IN THIS WAY. YOU AND I ARE TWO OF A KIND. IN A DIFFERENT REALITY, I COULD HAVE CALLED YOU FRIEND."" It's entirely believable from what we've seen. For both Kirk and the Commander none of this was personal. There was no malice. Each was doing his duty and that forced them into a conflict where only one could survive.",9
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Balance of Terror (TV Episode 1966)",Evenly matched adversaries,"Things start out on a happy note in this Star Trek episode. A couple of young of the younger members of the Enterprise crew are getting married and William Shatner notes he has the happy duty afforded ship's captains from earth of performing marriages. But a red alert brings everyone to battle stations as a Romulan war bird with functioning cloaking device starts destroying Federation outposts on asteroids near the neutral zone.We never know what the intention is, to provoke a shooting war or just test the earth alertness. But the Enterprise is the ship on the scene and Shatner enters a battle of wits with a very shrewd Romulan commander Mark Lenard. Watching these two circle around and try and guess the other's intentions shows us a pair of evenly matched adversaries. Lenard too as does Shatner in every episode shows the strain of command. Both know they're not facing fools. The respect for each other as a representative of a different culture also grows. In another century Humans and Romulans would still be at each other's throats in Star Trek Next Genertion and Deep Space Nine.When the phasers and disrupters start firing the tension never lets up.",9
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Balance of Terror (TV Episode 1966)",Balance of greatness,"At face value, 'Balance of Terror' is as straightforward as they come; this is a classic submarine movie, complete with cat-n-mouse and silent running. Enterprise faces off with a Romulan warbird on the edge of the Neutral Zone; it's uncomplicated, but makes for some tense television.But then there's the sympathetic opponent, less a villain and more a like-minded captain on the opposite team from Kirk (Mark Lenard plays this well, and I can see why they brought him back to play Spock's father; the two don't seem all that far apart). These are two evenly-matched adversaries sizing each other up. This episode focuses on the profound responsibility of being a starship captain, the immense weight of some of these tactical decisions; and it's a great example of the Kirk/Spock/McCoy dynamic as they hash this thing out from all angles.In the end, it's just a riveting episode from start to finish; the grudges run deep, the conflict's great, and it's one of the more accessible episodes I've seen.9/10",9
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Balance of Terror (TV Episode 1966)",First time watching the Enterprise do battle is still the best,"I didn't realize just how much of this episode was taken from The Enemy Below until I finally saw the movie (it has since become my fave war flick). There were a couple of elements lifted from Run Silent Run Deep as well. Nothing wrong with stealing ideas, as long as you do something cool with them. And Roddenberry and company did something very cool with this one.Trouble starts right away, as a wedding between two junior officers (presided over by Kirk) is interrupted when the Romulans violate a 100-year old treaty by crossing the neutral zone and destroying a series of Federation outposts along the zone, ostensibly to test their superior weaponry and invisibility screen (and subsequent shift in the balance of power between the Romulans and the Federation, in their view) as a prelude to an all-out invasion. Kirk has to decide whether it's worth risking war to try and stop the Romulan ship, or if in fact the greater risk lies in letting the invaders go after they destroyed 4 military outposts. Kirk wisely chooses the latter.This is our first look at an enemy of the Federation, the Romulans, a warlike, yet in their own way honorable race who are distant relatives to the Vulcans. However, unlike their peaceful cousins, the Romulans did not renounce their emotions and violent and imperialistic ways, even as they advanced technologically.None of this matters to Mr. Stiles, the ship's navigator and this episode's chief antagonist on board the enterprise (the Romulan commander has his own problems with a gung-ho junior officer). All that matters to him is he hates Romulans and Spock looks like one..until the end when Spock saves his life (naturally). This contrasts sharply with Captain Kirk and the Romulan commander, neither of whom has any personal ill will towards the other at all. Both men are simply doing their duty. In fact there's a mutual respect. This is the first Trek episode to deal directly with prejudice, and it does so deftly (as opposed to season 3's not-so-subtle ""Let That be Your Last Battlefield"").Like The Enemy Below, we have a classic chess match between two ship commanders who are actually very much alike. You see right away that both of these captains are good..VERY good. If you were going into battle you'd want either of these men as your leader. Both are honorable and decent men who are duty bound. Yet even though the Romulan commander is bound by duty to his home world, he still finds himself wishing for destruction before he can make it home rather than start another interstellar war. Yet he still does everything he can to make it home, just as Kirk does everything he can to stop him.This is, in my opinion, one of Trek's 5 best. It has everything: Plenty of action, suspense, great dialogue, fine acting (I still maintain the Romulan Commander was Mark Lenard's best Trek role), and it manages to make its social commentary without being overly preachy. A pity Roddenberry forgot about the last part when he did TNG.Watch this episode, then watch The Enemy Below.",10
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Balance of Terror (TV Episode 1966)",Brilliant Cat and Mouse,"Rightly regarded as one of the best episodes of the series, Balance of Terror takes the plot of the 1957 submarine thriller The Enemy Below, and adds strong moral and personal stakes to the battle of wits. The result is a wonderfully suspenseful, and deeply affecting, episode.The episode opens with a wedding between two crew members, being presided over by Kirk. The nuptials, however, are interrupted by a red alert, as several Federation outposts on the Romulan neutral zone have suddenly gone silent, a century after a war between the Federation and the Romulans, where neither party made visual contact with the other. When the Enterprise goes in to investigate, they come across the latest output to be attacked; just before the outpost is destroyed, the commander tells the Enterprise that the attackers were undetectable, and had weaponry of incredible power. And thus, the cat-and-mouse game begins.Paul Schneider's script uses the sub hunter/submarine plot line extremely effectively, with Kirk and the Romulan commander (Mark Lenard) playing an elaborate chess game with much higher stakes. The back-and-forth between the two ships is counterpointed with the internal conflicts on both ships -- a bigoted navigator Stiles (Paul Comi) suspecting Spock of espionage, while the Romulan commander's distaste for the repeated martial pattern of the empire brings him into direct conflict with his more bellicose (and politically connected) second-in-command. Vincent McEveety's direction is equal strong, using shadow and extended silences effectively to set the siege-like mood, enhancing the tension.The performances are superb. Shatner gives one of his best turns, as we can almost literally see the weight of command wearing on him, while at the same time giving full demonstration of why Kirk commands a starship; Nimoy's performance is also exceptional, as his understatement serves to feed Stiles' suspicion of him; and Comi effectively conveys Stiles' bigotry, as well as its source, making his eventual epiphany all the more believable. And then there is Lenard (who would later play Sarek, Spock's father in ""Journey to Babel"") -- his performance is perhaps the best in the episode, mirroring Shatner's, with his character's ""humanity"" (for lack of a more apropos word) made all the more striking given the authoritarian upbringing. Those moments - - counterpointed with the character's tactical skill -- makes his eventual interaction with Kirk remarkably poignant. And then there is the finale -- effected without excessive sentimentality and, indeed, Shatner and Barbara Baldavin deliver a scene that is low-key, but equally poignant in its own way about the costs of war, and the need to balance those costs against the consequences.------As a final side note, and in response to one of the prior commenters, Spock's ""decision"" to save Stiles rather than Tomlinson isn't a real choice (and therefore, not really a failing of the episode) -- it is clear from the scene that, by the time Spock arrives, Tomlinson is unconscious (and, given that he runs directly toward the coolant leak, probably more likely dead already), while Stiles is still alive. Thus, Spock's decision is eminently logical and moral.------One of the best five episodes of the series.",10
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Balance of Terror (TV Episode 1966)",Possibly the best Star Trek episode ever,"Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode, THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best episode of the series. And, while I have always loved A PIECE OF THE ACTION because it is so much fun, I really do have to cast my vote as this Romulan episode as being the very best.The episode interestingly enough, is really like a WWII submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked Romulan ship and the Enterprise as it seeks to destroy the Romulans before they sneak back across the Neutral Zone after a raid on Federation outposts. In so many ways, the show is much like the film THE ENEMY BELOW--where the American Captain (Robert Mitchum) and the German Captain (Curt Jurgens) are shown in counter-point as they both try to outwit the other--and in the process develop a grudging respect for their foe.Interestingly enough, the episode is confined to the Enterprise--and this is amazing because an episode on board ship could easily have been static and dull. But, because the writing was so fantastic and the main characters written and acted so well (Shatner and Mark Leonard as the Romulan leader). Overall it's very tense and exciting. Oddly, for the die-hard Trekkers out there, they'll recognize Leonard as the same actor who later played Spock's father.The bottom line is this is simply a great and extremely engaging episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat.",10
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Balance of Terror (TV Episode 1966)","""Danger and I are old companions"" - Romulan Commander","Definitely a Top Ten episode of the series, and apparently an overwhelming favorite with fans on this board. The story introduces the Romulans and the Neutral Zone, while setting up a fascinating cat and mouse game between starship captains of virtually equal skill and talent. As Kirk matches the Romulan Commander move for move, he's dealt the ultimate compliment by his adversary - ""He's a sorcerer, that one"". Knowledgeable viewers have mentioned 1957's ""The Enemy Below"" as part inspiration for this Star Trek classic, and the plot might have been given an even greater psychological thrust in 1981's ""Das Boot"". But I digress.As the series progressed through this, the first season, it's interesting to see how Captain Kirk's leadership and authority were continually developed and expanded upon. Always willing to listen to the advice of his officers, it's never in doubt that Kirk himself will be the final arbiter of any decision to be made. What's interesting here is that Kirk recognizes that his duty might ultimately wind up making the Enterprise expendable. Interesting too, that Spock's logical approach leads him to the same conclusion as navigator Stiles (Paul Comi), who earlier expresses doubts about Spock's resolve. When Spock proclaims - ""I agree. Attack."" - it's a chilling moment.Underneath it all, Gene Roddenberry lays down a not so subtle sub-text involving racial prejudice and bigotry. It's patently clever that he does so by involving two alien races, instead of those we are so generally used to, black and white, North and South, Semitic/anti-Semitic. It helps one step outside the box of common stereotypes to question why one race, religion or nationality is any better or worse than another. Was Spock suddenly suspect because the first time ever seen Vulcan Commander looked similar in appearance? Not fair you say? But it's done all the time. Roddenberry was really well ahead of the curve on this, and he would do it again in future episodes.Fortunately for the Enterprise, Kirk makes all the right moves to defeat the Romulans. In the hands of less skilled writers, the story might have ended there with a victory for the good guys. However I admired the way the Vulcan Commander accepted his fate, refusing to accept sanctuary for himself and his crew. He says to his rival Kirk - ""In a different reality I could have called you friend"". It's those defining moments that make Star Trek a classic of Sci-fi television.",10
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Balance of Terror (TV Episode 1966)",Enter the Romulans,"Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever, Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense, with intelligent real-world parallels (the title refers to a situation very similar to what was going on between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War), spot-on characterizations and the introduction of Star Trek's second most important hostile alien race after the Klingons: the Romulans. After receiving a distress call from a Federation outpost, the Enterprise is dangerously close to the Neutral Zone which, if crossed, would lead to open conflict with the Romulans, although no one has ever actually seen them in the flesh. Soon enough, a Romulan vessel appears, carrying a new weapon and a cloaking device which makes it nearly impossible to defeat. Facing the threat of imminent annihilation, Kirk must engage in a battle of wits with the Romulan Commander (Mark Lenard) to ensure the survival of his crew. Unfortunately, the task is made more difficult when one of the men accuses Spock of being in league with the enemy, due to the physical resemblance between Romulans and Vulcans, two races that are, in fact, distantly related (a fact that is quite ironic with hindsight, given Lenard went on to play Spock's father Sarek starting with Season 2).Always very critical when it came to the subject of war, Star Trek enjoys one of its finest hours with its most gripping and tense take on the topic. Although the Romulans aren't actually based on the Soviets (the name is actually taken from Romulus, the founder of Rome), the scenario is quite obviously inspired by the very vivid fear American and Russian citizens had at the time that either nation might be able to destroy the other with nuclear weapons (that fear gave birth to the titular concept of ""balance of terror""). But even without the subtext, this remains an essential episode, due for the most part to the intellectual battle between the two adversaries, which translates into a thesping duel between Shatner and Lenard. No need to say who wins...",10
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Balance of Terror (TV Episode 1966)","""The Enemy Below""","Nearly ten years before Desilu Studios chanced Star Trek, Robert Mitchum and Curt Jurgens were up on the big screen showing the progenitor to one of Star Trek's more famous episodes in the form of a US Navy DDE (destroyer escort) matching wits with a German U-boat in the South Atlantic. This observation was not my own, but made by a good friend who works for another man that publishes a game based on the classic Star Trek franchise.Classic Roman society is used as a template for Vulcan cousins, and are assigned a nationalistic and expansionist philosophy, again not unlike Nazi Germany post the Imperial regime from which the Kaiser abdicated power after the first world war.The episode brings a flavor of the classic U-Boat sub hunt to the science fiction audience, and, remarkably, uses a then recently declassified (and still experimental) technology developed by the USAF; the cloaking device. The idea was to mask bombers (notably the B-51 Hustler if I recall correctly... which I may not) as they drove deep into enemy territory to deliver their payload. It was an airborne mimicry of the submarine concept. It's technical details are too lengthy and esoteric to place in this post (that, and I don't recall all of them now :-)), but the concept, down to its actual name, was used in this episode. And, if memory serves, in Lucas's ""The Empire Strikes Back"" in a throw away line just after the asteroid chase sequence.The episode, like the movie upon which it borrows, is rife with tension. One mind is pitted against another in a struggle for life and death. Each is duty bound to vanquish the other. They must act upon their orders to ensure their sides victory. Unlike the feature film, Trek's ""Balance of Terror"" has a definitive victor. I'll let you guess who it is ;-) But there's more than just a simple WW2 tale put into space operating here. Note the title. Note the period in which this episode and show were made; the Cold War. Marry the two, and keep in mind the various proxy wars both US and USSR waged across the globe, and you'll start to see the larger theme.Yet, with all this high mindedness, with all the military tactical tension, there are personal costs on both sides. It's not the primary focus of both film and episode, but a reminder of the cost of such conflict among fellow living creatures.Definitely worth seeing again.Enjoy.",
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Balance of Terror (TV Episode 1966)",I'm not Spartacus!,"This is one of the best of the early ""Star Trek"" episodes, with Kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded Romulans are racial offshoots of the Vulcans! Young Mr. Stiles, well-played by Paul Comi, is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the ""Star Trek"" universe. His barely disguised hatred of Mr. Spock is eerily similar to the post-9/11 hatred and suspicion many Americans have of people of Arab or Middle Eastern origin. The atmosphere of war-time paranoia is all too real. Then there's the Romulans: they're the ultimate Federation nemesis. The Klingons are nasty but basically harmless; more of a nuisance than a serious threat. The Romulans, however, mean business: they're the ancient Romans reborn in the space age; in spite of their Vulcanoid features they're clearly meant to remind us of imperial Rome, with names like Decius and titles like ""centurion"" and ""praetor."" The chain-mail armor is really cool. Familiar guest star Mark Lenard, who went on to play Spock's dad Sorek as well as the Klingon commander in ""Star Trek: the Motion Picture"" is an appropriately grizzled, war-weary commander, a character who bears a striking resemblance to Laurence Olivier's Crassus in ""Spartacus."" Also, his questioning of the Empire's unquenchable thirst for conquest reminds me of the similar misgivings Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) expressed at the beginning of ""Gladiator."" A must both for Trekkies and sword-and-sandal epic fans.",10
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Balance of Terror (TV Episode 1966)",More critical and positive comments on a great episode,"To start off, this happens to be my favorite of the ST OS.In addition to StuOz's critical comments I'll throw in some more: Getting technical, when the Enterprise fires it's photon torps at a blind target, they'd have to be mighty close to direct hits (I believe) in order to cause any disturbance much less damage to the Romulan vessel with the vacuum of space to contend with.I had somewhat of a problem with the Romulan commander questioning his faith in the Romulan ""protocol"" or their leadership, unless it has to do with attacking vulnerable targets (outposts in the neutral zone) that are not at war. Also, I don't think commander would fall for the basic, or simple tactics that Kirk played, such as ""playing dead,"" or falling for the ploy that the subordinate puts on him about whether or not to attack the Enterprise when it is playing dead.On the Enterprise: I'm surprised that after seeing the Romulan vessel's method of attack earlier, that Sulu would say, ""Are they surrendering?"" when it attacks the Enterprise the first time.Funny how Spock can only get the repair done on the weapons control right when the emergency is over.Also in the final attack, I thought the Romulan vessel was uncloaked too long (so long that Spock could run down a couple aisles and back to the weapons room and activate and fire the photon torpedoes. I would have used phasers at this point, but I'm sure it had to do with the technicians and budget).On the positive side: It's a good drama played on the Romulan vessel, in which to introduce us to the Romulans. Great scenes with Stiles telling a good deal of the human knowledge of the Romulans. Also his conflict with Spock is right up there. I wished Stiles' character would have stayed on the show for a while, if for nothing else than the energy he added.It's only in fun that I point out the negatives and goofs, (I'm sure there are more). But for me this is as good as it gets!! ""Balance of Terror"" is always the one I place at the top in my ST rankings.",9
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Balance of Terror (TV Episode 1966)",First Romulan Appearance - Great Episode,"Season 1, episode 14. The Enterprise answers a distress call from the Federation Outpost #4 - they have been attacked. When the Enterprise heads that way, they witness F.O. #4 being destroyed on their viewing screen. The Romulan vessel remains cloaked until ready to fire, very much the way the Klingon Bird of Prey does. Stiles is at the helm and tells Kirk that he's sure it is Romulans - he's learned this from his family. Romulans have not been seen in more than a century so no one knows what a Romulan looks like but the Enterprise does catch a quick view on their monitor of the Romulan Commander, this gives Stiles a reason to sneer at Spock who never has seen a Romulan either. Kirk must decide on what to do, they are at the Neutral Zone - do they attack or let the Romulan ship go after witness first hand the attack on and disintegration of F.O. #4? One of the better Star Trek episodes that you'll ever see. It seems to really capture what the series is all about in the brightest light possible.9/10",9
14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Balance of Terror (TV Episode 1966)",Intergalactic Space Battle,"It's interesting that so many reviewers are so excited by this episode because it has to do with warfare. I've always enjoyed the more intellectual types of science fiction and feel this is often the lowest common denominator. It's why I see the Star Wars original movies as more Western than science fiction. That aside, this particular offering, with the introduction of the Romulans and a battle of wits between the two Captains is very good. Kirk is probably at the best he has ever been. Because the two vessels are unknown to each other, they must do two things. They must analyze and they must react. We also have a pair of truly contrasting cultures. Throw in the Vulcan angle (a possible split of purposes back in the day) with Spock being seen as a potential traitor and it gets really interesting. The conclusion is well set up and I won't comment on it specifically, but really pulls the whole thing together. All the actors deliver nice performances. We don't mention the secondary people, like Mr. Sulu, often enough, but they are really significant in this episode.",9
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Balance of Terror (TV Episode 1966)",The Enterprise meets the Romulans face to face for the 1st time,"I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series--my only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan Commander. My reasoning is this--if you were not around for the first run of this episode, then you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Spock's father. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie (or Trekker--your preference) it takes you out of the scene at first. Yet he's an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well-acted by all. There are excellent points made by both sides about the cost of war vs.the price of peace and certainly does remind one of some of the best of the WWII and later era movies. Those are not my favorite genre but I certainly would recommend a fan of such to view this episode through that filter. You'll see it holds up. I'll never understand why Sci-Fi gets so little respect--the best drama comes out of placing ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.",9
16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Balance of Terror (TV Episode 1966)",Classic Star Trek- Balance of Terror,"""Balance of Terror"" is, to this Star Trek fan, what the series is all about. The story is tense, compelling, and thought-provoking. It deals with two strategic, tactical generals, using their intellect and cleverness in a game of cat and mouse, Captain James T Kirk (Shatner, in my mind, has rarely been better as Kirk than here, where we literally see the cerebral chessmaster contemplating and debating within himself the next move to make)directing the USS Starship Enterprise to the Neutral Zone after reports of destroyed outposts which guard said zone (built on asteroids that surround the NZ) leading him to believe that perhaps the Romulans (a warring race who engaged in combat with Earth vessels a century ago) have attacked in a breach of a peace treaty that ended the war between the two races.Mark Lenard is exceptional as Kirk's equal, the Romulan commander in charge of a warbird that has cloking capability (a first for the United Federation of Planets) and a devastating weapon that can render the most powerful metal obsolete ( a type of plasma that can disintegrate asteroids is pretty damn scary). The key to this episode's power is Kirk's back-and-forth with the Romulan Commander and the pressure placed on both leaders as they determine what the next move needs to be. Each strikes, damage on both sides (casualties and ship damage), and we see how both Kirk and the Romulan Commander react, deep-thinkers planning on what the next cause of action should be. I love the way both crews are at alert, operating their posts, the seriousness of the situation, as life and death factor/weigh heavily on attention to detail and not making miscalculations. Even Uhura must operate the console at one point which someone like me thought was really cool, as Sulu reacts with a smirkin battle, you never know what might happen.Lots of memorable scenes, so many, such as the first glimpse at the Romulan race, with Lenard turning around to unveil Vulcan pointy ears and eyebrows, with vocal, emotionally charged con Hansen (Garry Walberg, a rare chance to see a crew member of the Bridge openly voice his opinion on matters such as Spock's similarity to the Romulan race being a danger to ship (clearly the script's indicting of racism) and his open hatred for this enemy because of the loss of ancestors at their hands, not to mention, his discouragement at not engaging the enemy after they destroyed the outposts in an open act of war) vilifying Spock due to his likeness to the Romulans. I think the best examples of this show, compared to the many campier episodes, are when we see Kirk challenged by a race with the Enterprise and its crew in peril. There's this marvelous scene (similar to Captain Pike's in ""The Cage"") where Kirk is in his quarters lamenting on the difficult task of having the lives of a crew resting on his decisions to Bones, with the good doctor providing words of wisdom when needed the most. Spock even gets to save the day when the detrimental need for phasers leads to saving his most livid critic, Hansen, as well as, providing the ship with weapon capability at the most imperative time. There is a bit of tragedy (most of us could see this coming a mile away) in that a wedding was to take place, interrupted by the Romulan conflict, resulting in those plans never coming to fruition. In my opinion, ""Balance of Terror"" is one of the greatest Classic Star Trek episodes of the series—and of all the various other series for that matter. I think the template for Captains under pressure in strategic situations come from ""Balance of Terror"".",10
17,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Balance of Terror (TV Episode 1966)",BRILLIANT EPISODE,"Brilliant, suspenseful, excellently acted. I watched this one again---for the umpteenth time---and I was particularly enthralled by Mark Lenard's portrayal of the Romulan starship commander who had serious doubts about his role. Where his subordinates, who perhaps were too quick on the trigger, wanted to engage in mortal combat, he exercised caution, gave thought to the strategic aspects of the conflict, and had only respect and admiration for Captain Kirk's maneuvers; near the end, conceding defeat, he said to Kirk ""In another reality I could have called you friend."" And even as he performed his last duty, blowing up the bird of prey and himself with it,I knew that we would see him again---on our side of the fence, as Ambassador Sarek of Vulcan. Four stars all the way.",10
18,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Balance of Terror (TV Episode 1966)",Balance of Terror,"This particular episode of the original series ""Star Trek"" perhaps best represents the ""old west"" and/or military conflict (American style)film/television program of the twentieth century, wherein it's pretty obvious which are the ""good guys,"" and which are the ""bad guys.""Back in those relatively simple times, it was always so easy to take sides. The Americans, or in this case, the Federation military were simply going around trying to set things ""a-right."" And it seemed so clear in those days who the bad guys were.Nowadays, things have gotten SO complicated.Anyway, in this particular program, Balance of Terror, as another respondent on this website mentions, there are no weird personality profiles--no tribbles (which, don't get me wrong, was very, very funny) no one on the surface of some weird planet with impossible parallels to our planet; this is straight out military battle in space.And you know, over time, in this series, and the subsequent spin-offs--you really don't get that, that often. It's particularly enjoyable with an excellent sound system. One actually gets about as close to a feeling of ""being there"" as you can get."" The original series is going to be available regularly come November ('06), on T.V.

The captain, what appears to be his older executive officer and the way they act toward the prospect of War. Also the scene where Spock accidentally hits a button cause an interruption in their Silent Running. It was that type of scene in the original movie The Enemy below.

Evoking WWII submarine films like The Enemy Below and Run Silent Run Deep, this is a taut and lean thriller expertly realized by everyone involved; Particularly William Shatner. For me Shatner has always been Trek's MVP, lifting even the most pedestrian episodes w/his hammy theatrics, but here he really shows how good he can be when he dials it down and plays things straight. The framing device--a wedding between two young shipmates--gives the entire episode a real poignancy and emotional weight.",9

0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Shore Leave (TV Episode 1966)","Let's have a little lightweight entertainment, shall we?","Probably one of the prime examples of following a suspenseful, dramatic episode (in this case, the superb Balance of Terror) with a lighter affair, Shore Leave is the first true attempt on behalf of the Star Trek writers to produce a more entertaining piece of sci-fi, and while the formula isn't quite right yet in this entry (the true triumph is Trouble with Tribbles, in Season 2), the laughs come pretty fast as long as the viewer is willing to allow for all the silliness.Diverting from the show's tradition, the Enterprise isn't on any proper mission in this episode. Instead, Kirk has found a perfect planet for his crew to spend some time off duty: a well deserved break after three months of incessant work. The Earth-like planet (a budget-related fact) is very appealing, but it only takes a few minutes before something weird happens: Dr. McCoy starts having visions of a white rabbit that seems to come straight out of Lewis Carroll's work. Soon, other people begin experiencing similar things: a woman meets a Don Juan-like character, Sulu has a run-in with a samurai, and Kirk faces a double encounter with the past, in the shape of almost love and the guy who used to pick on him at the Academy. Throw in a freakishly real-looking tiger, and it's easy to see why Kirk and Spock are determined to figure out what's going on before anybody gets hurt.The idea is a classic one: idyllic place turns out to be far from heavenly. The episode's humorous take on the topic is rather successful, weren't it for a dark turn of events that doesn't sit well with the rest (of course, everything works out fine again come the end) and the cast's general unwillingness to show a funnier side of themselves (most notably, and ironically, the otherwise hilarious William Shatner). And yet Shore Leave deserves recognition for being another good example of the writers trying new, previously unseen things: the definition of Star Trek's success.7,5/10",8
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Shore Leave (TV Episode 1966)","Viewed in context, Shore Leave succeeds","Bogmeister and others have pretty much nailed this. Shore Leave is really TOS' first attempt at lightweight sci-fi (which they would later perfect with the classic Trouble with Tribbles). It gave both the crew of the Enterprise and its TV viewers a needed respite from the universe threatening consequences of, for example, The Corbomite Manouever.Looking for a place to chill out for a while, the Enterprise happens across a seemingly idyllic M Class planet, and sends an exploratory team down to take a closer look. Soon enough all kinds of absurdities begin to take place - some seemingly perilous - but it all seems a morass of human emotional extremities played out in a weird blend of fantastic mystery (McCoy has gone through the looking glass), psychological thriller (Kirk is stalked by an indefatigable bully from his past), and romantic comedy (no comment).TOS was the least serialized of all of the series in the Trek franchise, so it is easy to forget how many episodes in the first season focused on heavy-handed, potentially calamitous drama. Unlike later series franchise writers, TOS' production team was not afraid to literally go where no TV series had gone before. And Shore Leave, despite its occasional problems, is an example. My only criticism of this episode is that the cast (particularly Shatner - ironic given his legendary sense of humor) didn't seem to know how to handle this new wrinkle on ST's themes. The last scene is possibly one of the worst scenes I can remember from the entire TOS run - both compositionally and in terms of acting.'nuff said. My recommendation - see it while watching the entire first season as it was meant to be seen - it order.",7
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Shore Leave (TV Episode 1966)",It's Just What the Doctor Ordered,"This one's a romp; many Trek fans don't rate this as high as the well-known all-time classic episodes because it lacks the deep meaning or undertone of those really great ones, but this one is so well executed for what it is, so successful as pure entertainment, it always makes my personal list of the top half dozen episodes, no matter what mood I'm in. Several well known future movies (""Westworld"") and TV shows (the more bland ""Fantasy Island"") took their cue from the premise of this episode (then, of course, the TNG show revamped the concept with the holodeck technology). Beautifully filmed (especially evident in the restored version and on DVD) and directed, it takes place in the nice park-like setting of a planet which the Enterprise has just arrived to. It's odd that no animal life, even insects, seems to exist here (how are flowers pollinated, for example), but things turn really odd when members of the landing party start seeing people from their past (Kirk has a people-heavy past, it turns out), as well as figures from other well-known fantasy stories. Sulu even finds an old-style police revolver (adding to his collection of swords, no doubt).By this point in the Trek series (halfway thru the first season), the main characters had pretty much solidified into the old friends we'd come to know over the many proceeding years. Here, we get to really see them relax, converse and work together to figure out this episode's puzzle: the strong narrative is a mystery again, of sorts, and the audience is along for the ride as Kirk & friends seek to unravel a very bizarre series of events which have a decidedly amusing flavor to them. It's almost whimsical, following up on the carefree style established up on the starship as Kirk was finally maneuvered into beaming down after showing definite signs of stress and fatigue (the Enterprise had, it's suggested, just completed a harrowing mission). Then Dr. McCoy is killed by a knight on horseback; yes, this is Dr. McCoy's final episode...just kidding. But, it's no joke to the rest of the landing party at this point in the story. McCoy really is dead for all intents and purposes and, like the best Trek episodes, the 2nd half of this adventure escalates to a more frantic, more desperate tempo of action and suspense. This is all signaled by Kirk's resolute response to Sulu, who voices his lack of understanding about any of these events just after McCoy's death - Kirk will get to the bottom of all this, come what may.But, it doesn't get much easier for Kirk: what follows is probably the longest staged mano-a-mano fight for the series as Kirk tussles with his nemesis from his academy days, a struggle that seems to take place over half the planet. Yet, this is counterbalanced by scenes of extraordinary tenderness, with another of Kirk's past acquaintances. This episode runs the gamut of all human experience, rather fitting in light of what we learn about the actual purpose of this weird planet. It's gratifying that the script really does explain all of what's happened, as opposed to some nonsensical approach which permeates many other fantasy & sci-fi series with similar plot lines (unexplained appearances by persons who could not possibly be there). And there actually is a subtext to the story - that we humans need to 'work' off our tensions and fatigue in a particular fashion, or we just don't function in a 'normal' natural way. Also, note the appearance of the very cute Yeoman Barrows and the sudden absence of Yeoman Rand, who did not return until the first Trek movie in '79. I believe that after this episode, even more Trek fans couldn't wait for the next appearance of all their favorite characters. But I leave this episode with a final, perhaps tantalizing thought: if McCoy was killed (verified by Spock), how do we know it was our real McCoy who beamed back up to the ship? Perhaps this explains why this McCoy was still inspecting starships about a century later and getting along very well with Data.",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Shore Leave (TV Episode 1966)",Great stuff if you'll allow yourself to just sit back and enjoy the craziness,"This is one of the shallowest episodes in that the plot really seemed like an excuse to just have fun. BUT, I appreciated this light- hearted approach and this is truly one of the best episodes to see on a purely fun level. Think about it--the crew members have encounters with the white rabbit and Alice from Wonderland, a Bengal tiger, a samurai warrior, a knight on horseback who kills McCoy, and a host of other seemingly bizarre events that just don't make any sense at all until the very end. Despite all the danger, you just can't take everything very seriously--it's just too fun and the whole episode seems very surreal. So, on a purely non-aesthetic level, it's great stuff.By the way, when the plane appears, it's VERY sloppily done. It changed from what appears to be a Hellcat then Corsair fighter plane. However, in closeups, its color is VERY different and is some American plane (a P-35 perhaps) and isn't dark blue but bright gray with Japanese markings! Sloppy.",9
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Shore Leave (TV Episode 1966)",A Visit To Wonderland,"I watched SHORE LEAVE the other day. I've seen it so many times, and I never get tired of it. Strangely enough, every time I watch it lately, it takes me right back to the very first time I saw it. Including this time. Must be that sense of mystery and ""What IS going on here?"" about it.Oddly enough, the one part of the story that ALWAYS felt awkward and uncomfortable for me, this time, actually had a HUGE effect on me-- Ruth. I think a lot of it was Gerald Fried's score. A real masterpiece, that! The romantic section was reused-- much more extensively-- in THIS SIDE OF PARADISE. But of course, it debuted here. I get the impression that, out of all the girls Kirk knew over the years, she may have been the ""sweetest"". When she said, ""Do you have to go?"", combined with the music, I could really feel the pain she must have felt at not being able to have him stay with her.Someone commented online that Ruth looked older than he was, yet she wasn't supposed to have aged at all in 15 years. Which makes me think... MAYBE she was one of the teachers at the academy. Kirk had an affair with an older woman! (Perhaps he thought back to this in ""MIRI"" when he told Janice, ""I never get involved with older women."" Maybe he meant, ""...anymore.""Reading ST reviews the other day, I see where someone compared WHAT ARE LITTLE GIRLS MADE OF? with I, MUDD. But it seems SHORE LEAVE oughta be in there, too. What are all those ""people"" if not androids? And could ""The Caretaker"" be related to ""The Old Ones"" from the earlier episode? Whoever he is, he seems to be one of the RARE cases in ST where you have a race that is actually ""superior"" as opposed to merely thinking they are.Yeoman Barrows seems to be filling in for Yeoman Rand. Considering how much attention Dr. McCoy showered on her, it's just one more frustrating example of a potentially good character who appears once and then never shows up again! Sheesh.One thing missing from the last several I've watched that snuck back in here was, Spock smiling. He was! I saw him. I really prefer knowing there's 2 sides to him going on inside all the time, rather than this ""submerged"" business. When he said, ""Enjoy yourself, sir."" near the beginning, you could see it wasn't just his addressing his superior officer, but talking to his friend. And at the end, when he needlessly says, ""Totally illogical!"", I can't help but think he does it purely to provoke a reaction. He may not be smiling or laughing, but I think he likes seeing his fellow crew members around him happy.",8
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Shore Leave (TV Episode 1966)","Another of the top flight, well-written, well-acted fun episodes","An Enterprise landing party investigates a idyllic planet that sensors show has no life on it. But the landing party members start seeing things that seem to have leaped from their imaginations: Dr. McCoy sees the White Rabbit from ""Alice in Wonderland,"" Sulu sees a samurai, Kirk meets an old academy bully and an old flame and things like tigers and fighter planes crop up. The landing party must figure out what's going on, because this seemingly idyllic planet is draining the Enterprise of power, and the at-first innocuous visions are becoming more and more threatening.Shore Leave is right up there with Doomsday Machine; Mirror, Mirror; and Errand of Mercy as the very best episodes of the series. It is well-paced, intelligently written, and it has a nice breezy comedic tone. For the most part the plot developments make sense and nobody does anything illogical for their situation: and the stakes and air of danger grow and keep the audience interested. And characters commit no contrived, dumb actions obviously forced into the story to move it along (arguably. Even if they do it's not so bad to ruin the quality of the story). It is also nice to watch the characters reveal sides of their personalities by the things they imagine. We learn a little about Sulu's fascination with history, for example. This episode is also another chance for Spock to be at his best: cool, composed, indispensable to his captain, and effectual under pressure. I always liked Spock when he was that way. The rapport between Kirk and McCoy is nicely on display in how they discuss McCoy's sighting of the White Rabbit. The crew's camaraderie has always been a factor in any episode's success.The episode falls just short of a ten rating with me because of Kirk's awkward scene where he first encounters his old flame, Ruth. Also, the characters of Rodriguez and Angela are not properly closed out. A moment or two of time taken from the lengthy Kirk-Finnegan fist fight could have been used to fix that. Guest characters should always get a proper close-out. The script needed just the smallest polishing.But overall, a great, fun episode.",9
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Shore Leave (TV Episode 1966)","A fluffy, light episode but entertaining nonetheless","Another episode from childhood that, as an adult, I look back on with a different perspective. This was one of my favorite childhood episodes, one that really cemented my adoration of this show. However, on viewing this episode after 20 years, I'd say it is definitely one of the lighter ones, played for laughs and amusement, instead of the dramatic and well-constructed story lines in previous episodes in this, their first and best season. Perhaps this episode was written for a little fan R&R too! As Mr. Spock would say, the story just isn't logical but there are some amusing lines like, of course, Mr. Spock's final one at the end--when he asks the Captain, McCoy et al whether they enjoyed their R&R and they answer in the affirmative, he raises an eyebrow and says ""Fascinating..."" in only the way Mr. Spock could do that. An interesting story line, of course, the idea of an amusement park being actually amusing (instead of the fake and often annoying ""amusement"" of Disneyland, for example), being able to have one's wishes actually come true. Really, a great idea but not that well executed. And coming from Theodore Sturgeon, another of the great SF short story writers they used in the first season, one wonders how much tinkering was done to the script that Sturgeon turned in.Now, here is a little trivia I learned on this very site: In 1987, James Gunn established the Theodore Sturgeon Award for best short science fiction story. And I'll quote the rest from this site: In 1968 he {Sturgeon} wrote ""The Joy Machine"", a third script for the Star Trek TV series {Amok Time the other}, that was never shot. The main reason that it wasn't used in the series is that it contained expensive special effects sequences that would be too much for their budget. However, the script was adapted into a book by Sci-Fi writer James Gunn (Star Trek #80, The Original Series) and published by Pocket Books in 1996.I'd sum this up to say this episode is still very enjoyable, especially if one doesn't think too much about it. Just laugh and enjoy it and next episode we can get back to the serious stuff of protecting the universe.",7

Kirk and crew seem to have found the perfect planet for shore leave after an extended tour of duty has left everyone on board in need of rest, relaxation and so on. It appears for all intents and purposes to be an uninhabited Earth, with beautiful scenery and an ideal climate. The first indication that things might go just a little awry is when McCoy, leading an advance team, spots Alice (from Wonderland) following a large white rabbit wearing a vest. Kirk beams down and finds the others reporting similarly bizarre happenings and encounters. The one thing they all have in common is that each crew member was thinking about the person/place/thing they discovered right before they discovered it. This doesn't immediately sink in with Kirk or anyone else. More strangeness ensues, including sightings of Don Juan, a Siberian tiger, a WW2 fighter plane, etc; Kirk meets up with Ruth, a gorgeous old girlfriend (of course) and a bully from his Academy days, Finnegan. The chase/fight scene with Finnegan goes on too long but at the same time, McCoy is run through with a lance by a knight on horseback and apparently killed. Finally, an elderly man appears and explains what has been happening. The planet is a futuristic 'amusement park' where visitors have only to imagine something to have it appear. Nothing is permanent; McCoy isn't really dead. Once this is explained, Kirk decides to order shore leave for everyone after all.

Whether a rabbit and little girl right out of Alice in Wonderland, a gun, tiger, knight in shining armor, former aggravating and bullying prankster, old flame, or bomber plane, it seems the planet has the capability to manufacture them right after Bones, Sulu, Kirk, Rodriguez (Perry Lopez), Angela (Barbara Baldavin, returning from Balance of Terror), or Yeoman Tania (Emily Banks) thinks about them! Once again a member of the main cast (Bones on the receiving end of a joust!) perishes only to be resurrected later! Kirk and Bruce Mars beat each other to a pulp when the captain isn't reacquainting himself with a love from the past (Shirley Bonne). Spock's logic opposite so much illogic is most amusing. Bones and Tania flirting and getting all cutesy gets the doctor some minor romance for a change. The environment of the planet is a breath of fresh air when compared to the colorful studio sets often used. The vast space, like when Kirk gives Mars chase, gives opportunity for Trek to breathe. Oliver McGowen as the all-smiles planetary caretaker is quite a Barnum. Tipping off the viewer of something afoot is this antenna following the away team. Banks, besides being stunning, is full of spirit and plucky appeal as the Yeoman who, opinionated as she might be, encourages Kirk to get some rest. Banks in the fairy tale dress is a sight for sore eyes.",7
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Shore Leave (TV Episode 1966)",Just for fun,"To easily sum it up, this is a very swiss-cheesy episode. The cheesy part is easy to see, with what the limited number of manufactured units show themselves to be... dangerous-- the samurai, the bomber plane, the tiger, the knight; antagonistic-- Don Juan, Finnegan, the revolver; earth-reality-- the birds; child's fantasy-- the white rabbit and Alice, and the damsel outfit; and sexual pleasure-- Ruth and the fan-girls.Interesting. But the holes in the swiss cheese begin with trying to sort out how the particular thoughts are selected to be 'manufactured.' The first products, the rabbit and Alice, must come from Dr. McCoy's saying the place makes him think of something from Alice in Wonderland. But before then, he and Sulu were talking about there being no animal life on the planet. Why didn't all kinds of animals suddenly come out of the bushes? Perhaps the thoughts were not specific enough?Obviously, whether they were thinking about something real or something fictional did not matter. But if it were a question of specific overriding thoughts at the time, one would think a counterfeit Enterprise would show up. And as their communications were jammed, they were thinking strongly about renewing contact. Wonder why that 'wish' wasn't granted-- well, for a while. And before Spock beamed down, he would have been Kirk's thought, as least as much as Finnegan or Ruth; yet a manufactured Spock didn't appear. Perhaps the manifestation had to be something completely unavailable in reality to avoid making that planet a universal crime source?But maybe the biggest hole is in knowing the personality and operations of the manifestations. From viewer's perspective, the parts are 'all there.' Else, Kirk might have been in for some big surprise when he got 'Ruth' all alone. I suppose we can acquiesce that his thoughts of the female body were quite accurate, but to what extent was 'she' a living being who would have been better than the real thing? Better in that there was no disagreement to win, nothing contrary to what he wanted her to be... but if he kept her long enough, could she have actually have gotten pregnant with a human child? I assume not, as we learn from their analyzing the knight that his tissue was the same as the plant life there. But if a woman's fantasy there was to be impregnated by Mark Antony or Elvis Presley, could she have been? On that I also assume not, as the caretaker declared, ""None of this is permanent...""Well, as I title this, ""Just for fun."" You can't think too much about it. Like an earth amusement park (as Spock mentioned), you can retain the experiences in your memory, but you can't take home the monsters from the fright house.",
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Shore Leave (TV Episode 1966)","""You know, you have to see this place to believe it"".","I used to think there was a logic to the expression of 'star dates', but a quick google search just now revealed otherwise. I bring this up because in 'Shore Leave', actress Barbara Baldavin returns as an Enterprise crew member named Angela. She had also appeared in the prior episode of the series, 'Balance of Terror', as the young woman about to be married just as the Romulans attacked Outpost Four. One could presume that this story followed 'Balance of Terror' chronologically; the crew would certainly have earned their vacation time following the events of that story. Yet the star dates of both episodes bear no chronology, and Angela obviously was not grieving for the fiancé she lost in the battle against the Romulans. So 'Shore Leave' could have occurred before or after. In any event, not too consequential.What's most interesting to me about this episode is the way it seems to take what could be considered quite ordinary and turn it into the whimsical. Not that a White Rabbit or a Samurai Warrior are ordinary in the course of every day events, but they, along with Kirk's Finnegan and Ruth, take on a surreal expression in Star Trek's first encounter with a Class M planet. Just like the crew of the Enterprise, I think the average viewer probably welcomed the down time, with no cosmic catastrophe to contend with (the alliteration just happened, I wasn't planning it).For the most part, I think the story worked pretty well and was quite enjoyable. It did leave some unfinished business between McCoy and Yeoman Barrows (Emily Banks); in that respect I'm reminded of all those early Twilight Zone episodes in which events just seemed to end with the story, even though there had to be some reality going forward for those same characters or their families to deal with. But I guess it didn't bother anyone enough to contend with down the road, or down the universe as it were. So with that, this one's viable for my personal Top Ten ST list as I try to pick them off on the fly while watching the show in series order, something I was never able to do while catching re-runs at random in the Seventies.",8

I really like how we're all on the same boat as everyone else, as there are a bunch of things just appearing out of nowhere, I remember when McCoy was seeing the White Rabbit and Alice, I thought ""What the Hell?"" That of course is Kirk and the crews first step down the rabbit hole.Just a lot of crazy things are happening like we this young couple Angela and the guy in the blue uniform forgot his name. We see a couple of World War 2 planes appear and shoot at them; though the weardest thing about it how they just apeared and reacted once the blue guy thought and said it.Same with Kirk when he recalls someone at the Acadamy whom beat him in a fist fight, that guy appears. This is the highlight of the episode as it results in probably one of the best one on one fights in ""Star Trek"" in my book it's also one of the longest up there with the street fight in the film ""They Live"". I really like that this fist fight is fun and funny because both guys in the tussle look like their having fun. You just see the guy constantly goating Kirk and seeing that firery look on Kirk's face I thought ""Ah, man your just asking for it.""You might be able to figure it out a little earlier before the end what's going on but it didn't deter anything where just like in any recreation time actually gave me a good feeling.Rating: 3 and a half stars.",9
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Shore Leave (TV Episode 1966)",The ultimate theme park or the ultimate nightmare?,"After a long period without the crew getting any R&R the arrival of the Enterprise at an idyllic but uninhabited planet would appear to be just what they need. Before the entire crew beams down a small away team visits to confirm that it is suitable. Strange things soon start to happen; just after McCoy comments that it is like something from 'Alice in Wonderland' he sees a giant rabbit and a little blonde girl! At first he believes he must be imagining things but the rabbit has left footprints that are visible for all to see. Similar things continue to happen; as soon as somebody mentions something, or even thinks of something, it comes to be. Sometimes it is harmless, sometimes annoying and sometimes it is dangerous when Dr McCoy is killed by a knight they realise just how dangerous this world is. Once they determine that their thoughts are becoming real they have to try to avoid thinking of any danger something that is quite difficult.When the white rabbit appeared it was immediately obvious that this was going to be a more lighthearted episode. It also led me to think it might be a weaker episode; this opinion was strengthened by the appearance of Finnegan; a particularly irritating character I can understand why Kirk wanted to thump him! Thankfully as we see the apparent dangers of this planet it becomes more interesting. The death of Dr McCoy came as quite a surprise even though it turned out to be only a temporary condition. The various dangers the crew imagine are varied and fairly entertaining and when we learn the true nature of the planet it nicely explains what we have seen before. It is interesting to note that regular character Yeoman Rand has vanished without explanation and been replaced by Yeoman Barrows; who despite being a fairly major character in this episode isn't seen again. Overall a rather fun episode; certainly much better than its opening led me to expect.",8
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Shore Leave (TV Episode 1966)","Far better than many ""serious"" episodes.","SL is one of ST's half-dozen or so lighthearted episodes, out of which all are above-average except ""The Naked Time"", which is crap. Visually one of the best. Kirk's one-time Irish nemesis is too over-the-top, though, a bit annoying, like a character out of a silly 60s Disney comedy for kids. McCoy is in a somewhat ridiculous love-interest situation with a rather attractive blond yeoman, while Kirk's old flame looks older than him - yet is meant to have not aged at all! Having the mannequin-androids kill two of the crew (including McCoy) was a bit illogical, considering that this was supposed to be an amusement park of sorts.",
14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Shore Leave (TV Episode 1966)","Silly waste of time (cf ""The Enemy Within"")","This one was pretty dumb. Much as I like this series, I can't recommend this episode.Like the earlier Season 1 episode, ""The Enemy Within"", this episode was basically a one-note joke that really could have played out in 15-20 minutes instead of being stretched out to a painfully long 50 minutes. It's a lot like one of the less-good episodes of ""Twilight Zone""-- basically one minor ""twist"" and that's about it-- and just about as well explained-- that is, hardly at all. Star Trek episodes should be a little bit less dumb than this, at least IMO.The basic idea is that the crew is given access to a 'playground' planet that allows them to live out any fantasies they desire, without any long-term consequences. The crew takes forever to figure out what's going on, since the planet seemed fairly harmless and bereft of intelligent life, at first glance, but seems much more sinister, soon enough, as any casual thought seemingly becomes reality (i.e. think of a tiger and a tiger appears). This was mildly amusing as a diversionary episode, I suppose, but rather unsatisfying in execution; little insight is offered into any of the characters (except for a lost-love of Kirk, who is, however, never even mentioned again) and no 'explanation' at all is given for the seemingly impossible technology involved.Some of the sequences are mildly amusing, but others are less so. McCoy's miraculous and unexplained ""resurrection"" after his seeming violent demise, which had understandably traumatized the rest of the landing party, was the worst part of all. When Kirk asks the caretaker who they are, he basically answers, ""you're not ready to know."" In other words, the writer didn't even bother trying to come up with any explanation at all, and instead made this a pure fantasy story rather than scifi.I rated this one slightly higher than ""The Enemy Within"" because this episode is slightly more pleasant, but it's comparably silly. Like that episode, this one doesn't bear well on re-watch, either. My recommendation is to see it just once (to see for yourself) but I wouldn't waste my time watching this one again. Or, alternatively, just fast-forward most of it, from the opening sequence to the ""punchline"", the second time around; at least that's what I plan to do, if I ever feel compelled to review this episode again as part of a complete series review.Sulu kind of got short shrift here. Even Yeoman Barrows (Emily Banks) had a larger part here than he did-- and why would she take a shine to the (much older) McCoy? Uhura appeared very briefly but was strangely MIA for most of the episode.",3
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Shore Leave (TV Episode 1966)",One of the dumber episodes.,"Well Spoke, Kirk and McCoy and the gang go on a planet for some relaxation. Regrettably relaxation is not what they are getting. Instead whatever the crew thinks about tries to kill them. McCoy, the idiot, let himself get speared. Regrettably, Shore Leave ends with a super race of people who manufacturers the crews thoughts for entertainment!?! Why do such a thing? Such a stupid concept. Why would the crew think about horrific things all the time? Instead of thinking about good things like foot long subs, attractive women, fast cars, etc is another question? The crew must be morbid! Anyways, Shore Leave is memorable in a bad way. Ugh 6 out of 10.",6
16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Shore Leave (TV Episode 1966)","""Captain, you don't seem to understand...""","Was the friendly admonishment at the end of this very highly sexually charged episode. The burden of command weighs heavily on Kirk's mind as he pits his academy training against the puzzle that is a world fraught with fantasy.There's actually a historical and psychological basis for this episode, but I'll refrain from stating the obvious and spoiling the magic of this installment of Trek. I will say this; Imagine you are given the ability to let your thoughts wander. Imagine you are allowed to be a child again. Recall those times when you were happier. The burden of keeping yourself out of debt (or paying off debts), staying on good even footing with the boss, keeping up with your work, navigating office politics, weigh heavily on the average American worker. The sum total of these forces puts stress and strain on the material of the human soul. Mankind's malleability is put to test in world where social obligation collides with social interaction.The result is weariness, or a soul so dented and placed on alert, that any attempt to help it heal will be treated with mistrust.Fortunately the soul in question is crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise. When not making contact with far off aliens (benign and hostile alike), trailblazing and patrolling the space-ways of the 23rd century, we like to think the crew of our favorite starship gets a little down time. But what is there to do aboard a battleship gray interior vessel? Play 3D chess in the galley? Listen to the communication's officer sing another a-capella tune? Maybe the first officer will treat us with a light sonata on his Vulcan harp. Hardly a vacation.For children, recess is the order of the day. Swimming, playing ball, pretending, riding bikes, or even watching their favorite program. For adults things are a little more complicated. The accompaniment of a loved one. The ability to treat that someone special with a kind of affection that we could normally never give, and thereby demonstrate ( or rather live out) a fantasy that would warm both hearts.Note the characters. Note Kirk's actions, and the mainstay characters of the series that are highlighted. Which of Kirk's alter egos gets more play in this episode? Spock or McCoy? And who is it that comes up with the final solution? And whose solution is more beneficent and healthful to those in need?Production Values; are pretty high in this episode. For all the straightforwardness and basic nature of the story, we have an elaborate array of props and settings. This thing must have been one of the more expensive episodes to film, and it also turns out to be one of the more relaxing, intriguing, and in its own way, fun episodes to watch.There's more than one underlying message here. It's a benign message first: a simple romp to remind people what they need on occasion. On a slightly more serious note it's also a reminder that perhaps danger, on occasion, is more a matter of perception. And on that note, reinforces the first message, which is the primary thrust.Back to the story; the story is actually based on clinical history for certain individuals. The author, Theodore Sturgeon, has taken those real world examples and ever so cleverly encoded an adult fantasy into Trekdom. Truly a work of subtle genius.The truth is a true review of this episode cannot be done without writing spoilers. As such I'll close with this; as my local PBS station (KQED Channel 9) often reminds me; ""Enjoy Life"".... now if I only had another paycheque.",
17,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Shore Leave (TV Episode 1966)",Entertaining if a little silly,"Apart from the obvious and many plot holes this is a very entertaining episode. I'm afraid that even I can't suspend my disbelief to the point where even an advanced alien civilisation can manufacture a fully functional WW2 fighter in just a few seconds. Also, why was the knight's face plastic looking when the show girls and Finnegan looked perfectly human? And as for Kirk's ex girlfriend? Am I the only person who found her totally unattractive? On the other hand I found yeoman Barrows an absolute doll. Bones and Sulu enjoy themselves and if you ignore the faults this is one of the best episodes if somewhat silly. Worth watching just to see the look of death that Barrows gives bones as he emerges arm in arm with two show girls at the end.",8

Anyway, the whole crew is able to engage in fantasies. There is no holodeck to keep them occupied so this is the next best thing. People get to face fears and antagonists and what appear to be life and death situations. Kirk finds Finnegan and then the love of his life.

A few people beam down and it is slowly apparent that one's inner thoughts and desires are made manifest here in physical form. This episode is quite revealing of Capt Kirk. Apparently his inner thoughts center around a couple of people from his youth about 15 years ago, who appear before his eyes. One, his upper class nemesis, and one his old flame. And quite a flame it was, as we plainly see by Shatner's emotional responses. We discover that these beings, which seem so real, are manufactured on demand on the planet. Good episode, although I would have preferred to see more of Kirk's pseudo lady love, as opposed to the classmate-bully. A little creepy that Kirk stayed around after for a day or two to ""socialize"" with the simulation of his ex. But one should probably not peer too deeply into the psychology of Star Trek.

Soon after arriving Kirk thinks about an old classmate and suddenly the classmate is there.It was a really fun episode and I liked some of the fantasies that seemed to be happening. It would have been nice if come of those fantasies had been explored a bit further. One of the problems I had with the episode was that it took forever for Kirk and the others to figure out that what they were thinking soon after happened. Another issue was that the fulfillment of these thoughts was somehow draining the energy from the Enterprise, but it never explained why it did that. Also, near the end, Kirk allows everyone to take shore leave to have their fantasies fulfilled but he doesn't worry about the drain on power that will cause the Enterprise. The scene where Kirk is fighting with his classmate went on too long. Some of the other fantasies should have been given a bit more time and less taken up with his fight.Overall, a fun episode that was a relaxing break from all the fighting and conflict they had been having lately.",7

The title might actually be a variation of ""Twelve Angry Men"" another story of several interesting characters forced into a situation where important choices need to be made. The characters of Spock, McCoy and Scott in particular are advanced here as we learn more about each of them. Spock's strictly logical thinking proves to be both an advantage and a detriment as he is the ranking officer and responsible for the ultimate choices being made here. McCoy on the other hand acts as Spock's ""human"" conscience, figuratively sitting on his shoulder and pushing him not to rely so much on his non-emotive Vulcan side. Scott merely does what he does best by tirelessly testing theories using the resources he's provided to do his part in solving the problem at hand. In this case, the shuttlecraft ""Galileo"" is stranded on a hostile planet with large alien creatures determined to prevent their escape. The conclusion will surprise you and ultimately gives some great insight into the character of Spock.",8
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Galileo Seven (TV Episode 1967)",I agree with Spock in this episode!,"This episode does have it's annoyances, the Galileo's mission seems poorly-timed (the Enterprise is delivering medical supplies to a planet that needs them and this side trip is questionable to me), it's something that just could have waited. The commissioner is a serious P.I.T.A. but what redeems him is that he IS right.What bothers me most is how everyone is coming down on Spock, calling him a machine, calling him unfeeling. Some of Spock's decisions ARE questionable but HE'S TRYING TO SAVE EVERYONE'S LIFE AND THEY'RE BUSTING HIS CHOPS. The scene that REALLY irritates me is when Boma pops his head in and says that they're ready for services for Latimer (a crewman who was speared in the back). Spock responds that they're working against the clock. I was like ""Really! Are funeral services REALLY the priority at the moment?"". Let's take a week off and sit shiva for our fallen comrade. If you're in a burning house, this isn't the time to go around and hang sheets over all the mirrors.Boma takes the same stance when they need to leave Gaetano's body behind. ""Not without a burial..."". If I were Spock, I would say ""We're taking off Mr. Boma. You snooze, you lose"".",8
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Galileo Seven (TV Episode 1967)",Will Spock's logic save the crew of the Galileo?,"While on a mercy mission to deliver medical supplies to Makus III the Enterprise passes by the Murasaki 312 quasar; with standing orders to investigate such phenomena, Kirk orders Spock and a team to take a shuttle to investigate. Interference from the quasar forces the shuttle to land on the planet Taurus II. It is out of sensor range and interference is blocking any communication with the Enterprise. A Federation commissioner aboard the Enterprise stresses to Kirk the need to get to Makus III and gives him limited time to find Spock and his team. Stress levels rise amongst the away team as Spock states that in order for them to take off again the shuttle will have to lose five hundred pounds in other words they won't all be going home. If that wasn't bad enough it turns out the planet is inhabited by primitive, giant people who kill one crewman with a spear before attacking the others. Spock uses his logic, along with Scotty's engineering skills, to find a way that might give them a small chance of survival while the others, including McCoy, criticise Spock's logical and unemotional approach to the situation.This was an enjoyable episode as it put somebody other than Kirk in the centre of the story. It was good to see how Spock's logical deductions save the day while the protestations of the others proved annoying at times at one point a character demanded that they give a dead crewmate a proper burial even though there were dangerous creatures about and they are racing against time to fix the shuttle sheer madness! Leonard Nimoy shows that he had the presence to lead the episode and the rest of the cast are solid enough. Strangely at the end we are lead to believe that Spock's final action was an act of emotion rather than logic in fact it seemed the most logical act of the episode. Overall a decent enough episode.",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Galileo Seven (TV Episode 1967)",Galileo in distress,"Leonard Nimoy gets command of an away team to explore a really desolated planet named Markus II which is always ravaged by ion storms. Because of that no one dares use the transporter on the Enterprise and so he gets a shuttlecraft for his mission.Once down Spock and the six crew members are stranded because those same ion storms make it difficult to return. The crew is also under attack by some savage ape like creatures which are the predominant life form. No appealing to their logic.Spock's ever calm logical manner does grate on the nerves of Dr. McCoy more than usual as well as crewman Don Marshall. DeForest Kelley's scenes with Nimoy have even more bite than usual, not to mention an almost mutinous Marshall.While all this is going William Shatner has to deal with a Federation commissioner who is ready to takeover the Enterprise as they are on a mission to take him to an outpost in distress.Of course with all these series regulars on the mission you know that they're coming back, at least most of them. Enterprise crew members that are not regulars don't have that same protection. Still the writing and directing keep up the necessary suspense to make this a thoroughly enjoyable episode.",8
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Galileo Seven (TV Episode 1967)",Mixed review,"I have mixed feelings about this episode. While its plot is a little absurd and thin, it doesn't defy scientific credibility as much as many episodes of the later series in the franchise do.Spock's relationship with the crew and his command abilities are challenged and nicely established as he commands a shuttlecraft on what should have been a routine exploratory mission (why bring along the chief engineer and chief medical officer, we will never know). The shuttle crash-lands on a class m planet in a quasar system with all communication and sensor use completely inhibited. Giant prehistoric people in a band-level society inhabit this planet and they are not pleased by the arrival of the Galileo 7. And Kirk has an annoyed bureaucrat who is late for an appointment on board the Enterprise. There is some interesting an surprisingly well-informed anthropological discourse in this episode but unfortunately the most interesting character introduced, Crewman Boma(Don Marshall) - apparently a social scientist- is inconsistently characterized. The plot is really a vehicle for character development in this case. It's about Spock, Spock's relationship with the crew, Spock's relationship with Kirk, and with McCoy. In some ways, a defining moment for the series. And the entire cast is up to the challenge. For me, this is the main appeal of the episode.",6
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Galileo Seven (TV Episode 1967)",I was disappointed,"At first I was looking forward to see ""The Galileo Seven"" because Spock had more important role than usually. I was hoping for some interesting character development, however my enthusiasm didn't last very long.PLOT: A scientific team led by Spock crash-lands on a planet inhabited by primitive but very dangerous creatures.MY OBJECTIONS: The members of the team questioned every Spock's order (they were very unprofessional). Most of their objections were about Spock's excessive use of logic but to me he didn't seem very logical in this episode.For example, Spock refused to use deadly force against obviously hostile creatures. He also ordered a crew-member to stay outside the shuttle alone (unsurprisingly the crew-member was killed). After that Spock risked his own life to bring the dead body back to the shuttle even though he knew they couldn't take him on board because the shuttle would be too heavy to take off.Finally the one logical decision he made (to ignite jettisoned fuel to draw Enterprise's attention) was regarded by everyone as illogical. I would certainly prefer to increase the chances to be found and saved than to pointlessly circle around the planet for few more minutes and die anyway.",5

It is to laugh.Near 30 years on, she is tangling with a Vulcan.This episode should also be noted as not following thru with the incorrect notion that all the guys in the red shirts are killed (both victims of the planet's monsters wore yellow shirts) and likewise the equally inexplicable idea that all the black guys were killed (the minority in this case survived).In truth, this episode watches like a strange predecessor to the disaster movie; who will survive, who will die? The three cast members will survive, the woman should survive so there won't be any calls of unfairness to women and Don Marshall should survive, which he did.Not a bad episode, actually.Wish there had been more episodes with Phyllis Douglas in them tho.",7
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Galileo Seven (TV Episode 1967)",Leadership.,"I can't add too many things to what others have already said regarding this installment of Trek. The primary theme here is what do men respond to? Are mere decisions based on the right evidence at the time all that it takes to lead? Can you merely delegate authority and expect men to obey you? What does it take to make men operate and bow to your commands?The episode is pretty melodramatic in the theme department, but is otherwise spot on with the exaggerations of character portrayed in this episode. Spock uses the best (and I'll add humane) reasoning, as he possibly can for what should (by all convention) provide the most promising outcome. But things don't go as planned. The outcomes gravely effect the crew, and Spock's ability to lead comes into question.Technical notes; I've seen makeup tests for the creatures inhabiting the world that is part of the setting, and I think Roddenberry and crew were right to not give us the full frontal view of said creatures. My only real critique of this episode is that it was shot on a stage, and we have egg crate lights hanging above trying to act as a faux sun for the actors. The result is like many an exterior location that was shot in doors; it looks fake. Adding to that are the cliffs and rock formations, which look twice as fake on a stage as they otherwise might have on the back lot. In addition we have some spear throwing by the natives that just looks pathetic at best. For all of the work that went into revamping the space-shots for the new release of the episodes, I'm pretty disappointed that no one tackled the issue of revamping some of the live SFX. Just me.As noted in other reviews, Nimoy is still feeling his character out, and therefore we're not presented with the utterly cool in all conditions Mister Spock, but one that still has traces of emotion running in his veins. I think what other reviewers fail to realize is that this is essentially a heightened scenario examining how even the best decisions can be seen as wrong by those who must carry out the orders unless some effort is made to inject belief and passion into the leader's instruction. As such the actors (and I'll even add the writer) are giving us an exaggeration of a leadership crisis. But Nimoy, Kelley and the rest deliver their lines and give us drama that we can sink our teeth into.There's a little more science in this episode than in others. Not much, but it's there. Take it for what it is, a first season episode with a visually mediocre setting, a relatively good story and acting, but some minor technical difficulties. Enjoy.",
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Galileo Seven (TV Episode 1967)",Classic Captain Quirk Chaos Manufacture Episode,"I will always have a soft spot for the admittedly uneven ""Galileo Seven"" episode where the still under-developed character of Lt. Commander Spock gets his big chance at command while leading an ill-fated shuttlecraft mission lost in an ion storm. This installment came fairly early in the series before Leonard Nimoy had truly grown into the role and was a misfired response to the breakout popularity of his Vulcan science officer sex symbol. Interestingly, what the cast & producers discovered while making the episode was almost exactly what the scriptwriter had concluded: That Spock on his own would rely upon dry, functional logic to the point of boredom. Spock's cool intellect without an ego to foil was less than half a loaf. But it's still a beloved favorite and one of the great ""Essence Of Star Trek"" episodes that sums up what made us love the show even if the end result is somewhat stale.First, this episode scared the dickens out of and thereby impressed us greatly during what became a routine after school ""Star Trek"" hour when the show was being syndicated during the early 1970s. Our local affiliate showed it in a 4pm slot squarely targeted at rambunctious kids home from school who would actually shut up and do something other than raise hell for an hour while ""Star Trek"" was on. Our parents made sure we never missed an afternoon! the result of which was a group of now 40+ year old guys who still love the show. This was one of the first episodes that made a big enough impression on our minds to remember specifically and we'd make believe our own ""Galileo Seven"" adventures using anything from a living room sofa to a tool shed as our Galileo shuttlecraft. Which delighted me to no end because I always got to be Scotty and he had a lot to do in this one.I also have an attachment to it that is purely coincidental but still made a huge impression on my mind when I learned of it: This one premiered the day after I was born, and has forever since been my Birthday Episode that I make an excuse to watch every year around the same time. That makes me a nerd but I can live with it and fortunately its still a pretty satisfying episode even if the weak spots kind of glare out when compared to more successful efforts that I rank up there higher on my Favorite Episode lists (""Arena"", ""The Omega Glory"", ""The Doomsday Machine""). And no, updating the graphics won't make it better. Who's bright idea was that anyway?But there are several appealing aspects to the episode on a structural level which overcome the rather wooden results of its execution. Kirk is more or less relegated to a secondary role on the ship looking concerned while Spock, Bones, and Scotty get some of their most extensive uninterrupted screen time of the whole series. There is a high quotient of guest star faces as well -- Don Marshall's foul tempered Lt. Boma and foxy Phyllis Douglas as Yeoman Mears with her fantastic space thighs being a welcome change of pace from the standard issue Bottle Episode crew. And while the studio bound Taurus II planetoid set is paper mache kitsch at it's closest to the absurd boundary as possible without being laughable, it lends a readymade ""make believe"" quality to the proceedings that are quite conducive towards inspiring the imaginations of 7 year olds for generations. What is there not to love about it? But let me get this straight ... Captain James T. Kirk decides to pedantically toe the line of regulation to the point of creating a crisis where one doesn't exist by insisting on sending out a flimsy, malfunction prone shuttlecraft loaded with his most valuable staff contingent into a dangerous ion storm generated by an unknown quasar like phenomenon while in the middle of delivering perishable drugs needed to avert a planet wide plague (!!), with no less than a Galactic High Commissioner on board, who is absolutely correct in openly wondering what the hell Kirk may have been *thinking* by taking such a chance. Here's a suggestion: Mark the location with a space buoy and come back AFTER the plague has been averted, the Galactic High Commissioner has been removed from your face, and you have the time to search for your best officers & closest personal friends if something goes wrong. It's a five year misson, Bro! What's the rush?Either the writer was inhaling whipped cream can fumes or Kirk's legendary status at that precious Academy of his should be re-examined. All along I've been annoyed at the wrong guy for being a bit dense. Sorry, Commissioner Ferris.8/10; Look for a sort of unofficial sequel to this in the Animated Series episode ""The Slaver Weapon"" where Spock's command of another shuttlecraft mission comes to somewhat more successful ends.",8
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Galileo Seven (TV Episode 1967)",Planet Of The Apes,"Intense episode about a shuttle craft mission lead by Spock that crash lands on a most unpleasant world. Indeed, the dangers posed by it's hostile environment leads to a near equally hostile landing party as Spock finds his leadership abilities called into question. It's been well explored how the Vulcan's logical approach to the crisis proves ineffective in dealing with the stressed-out humans under his command. The only thing to add might be that,at times, Spock does display an almost human surliness that seems very un-Vulcan. But, since this was a first season episode, it may have been filmed before Leonard Nimoy had fully come to understand his character and the proper way to play him, (for example, he was still speaking with that put-on British accent like when he pronounces command as ""cuh-mawnd""). Clearly, this is not the more controlled Mr. Spock we would see in later episodes like ""The Doomsday Machine"", but it's still a good performance and the script provides an interesting set of problems to watch the usually unflappable character struggle to deal with.As if crash landing wasn't bad enough, the primates that live on the planet are a neat addition to further complicate Spock's bad day. Not so much seen as glimpsed (and a wise move, too as the only one shown up close looks like it's wearing a fur dress), these hairy monsters prowl about in the fog making hissing noises and bellowing roars. They attack with huge spears, and in one scene a comparatively tiny human is mauled to death. Thoroughly nasty, their presence in the story leads to a neat scene on the Enterprise bridge as Kirk hears the report of a returning search party leader: appearing on a viewer screen all bruised up in a torn-up uniform, Lt. Commander Kelowitz tells Kirk how his team was attacked by ""creatures similar to ones discovered on Hanson's Planet, only much, much bigger. Ten- maybe twelve feet in height."" Clearly exhausted and maybe a touch traumatized, Kelowitz cautions Kirk that if the missing shuttle craft crew are on that planet, but doesn't have to finish the sentence for Kirk to get his meaning. It's an effective little touch that casts a shadow of dread on the possible fate of Kirk's missing crew members. In fact, they should have used this seldom seen character of Kelowitz more often as he would have made a great running bit. Like Scotty's dire warnings about the condition of the ship's engines, or those red shirted security men who were always first to bite the dust, you'd know the situation was dire if Kelowitz showed up with another alarming report for Kirk.",
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Galileo Seven (TV Episode 1967)",Like a Needle in some Space Haystack,"This one will always be known as spotlighting one of the shuttlecrafts that the starship has at its disposal. The downside of exploration is showcased in this episode, a case study of survival techniques and examining the group dynamics among several crew members stuck on a hostile planet. Rare for a first season episode, this focuses on Spock rather than Kirk, who remained on the Enterprise this time around. Spock's in command of the 7-member landing party of the shuttlecraft, though this landing was unplanned. Besides needing to figure out a way to lift off without fuel, they're besieged by some 10-foot-tall natives who like to throw huge spears at starfleet officers. Some of these scenes were actually pretty scary to me as an 8-year-old viewer; all that planetary fog or mist and those lumbering beast-men made me re-think my plans to become an astronaut. Kirk, meanwhile, fends off an annoying bureaucrat, a 'high commissioner,' on his bridge while attempting to locate his missing crew members without the usual instrumentation (ion storms, you know).Spock takes logic to faulty extremes during this crisis - all problems are addressed like a simple mathematical equation and this doesn't work with huge, hairy, unpredictable savages. Nor does his robotic attitude sit well with human beings who sometimes need words of encouragement and re-assurance in such times of great stress. He comes across as downright callous in some scenes - you'd think he'd know by now that you should at least give the appearance of giving a damn about a fallen comrade. I believe he overcompensates during this mission; despite his usual statements of not using emotion, he obviously feels the pressures of this command and his way of dealing with it is to go out of his way in alienating the rest of the party. Mostly, he sends the message that he's the smartest and half of them are expendable - not the best way to provide a positive spin on a mission gone wrong. McCoy & Scotty, along for this joyride, will back up Spock in the end even as they disagree with his methods, but a couple of the other crew members are pretty much insubordinate here. I'd be surprised if Spock didn't bring up charges back on the Enterprise - after he explained his lapse into illogic towards the end of the mission (cue: bridge crew laughing away all the built-up tension during this episode; above all, Starfleet needs happy bridge crews). McCoy does seem to win this round in his and Spock's ever-growing debate on the emotion over pure logic question.",8
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Galileo Seven (TV Episode 1967)",Galileo Seven - Below Par for the Series,"I just recently revisited this episode as I own the first series. I usually don't write reviews but was so frustrated with this episode that I thought I would give my two cents! I agree with many of the opinions shown posted here. While I find the episode still fun and entertaining, there are some major problems that leave the viewer frustrated. Mostly I just find the writing weak. Specifically I find the everyone behaving out of character. Their actions defy reason, and if anyone thinks for two seconds about anything they do, you realize that in a real situation almost nobody would act this way. Some examples: 1. Boma and other landing party insisting on having a funeral, while a ten foot bloodthirsty caveman is practically destroying the ship. (During times of crisis, In human history we have heard of numerous cases of people not only abandoning all tradition when faced with death, but going so far as to resort to cannibalism to survive. yet this crew is up in arms when Spock suggests that they can't have a full funeral service and burial.) 2. The landing party is far too quick to turn on Spock. It is pointed out that some have to be left behind in order for the ship to take off. (not enough fuel to support the full weight of the whole crew) It seems obvious to suggest some stay behind. WOULD YOU RATHER EVERYONE DIE? Yet they immediately jump on Spock for suggesting the obvious. 3. In order to belabour the point further that emotion is SO important. the other crew members are out an out cruel to Spock. ""OH now's your big chance Spock"" Mccoy says sarcastically. ""You always though logic was the best basis on which to build command!"" .. already busting his chops and he is just trying to repair the ship. Why?? They are immediately out to get him. I don't really think people would behave this way and would more likely at least attempt to stick together. Let's not forget they have already been on so many missions together. Would they not have at least a small amount of sympathy for each other? instead they are immediately at each others throats. The pattern of unreasonable behaviour to Spock continues through the episode, 4 . When the ship finally does reach orbit, everyone takes pot shots at Spock again. I find it poor writing that they wouldn't have at least one character be sympathetic to Spock. It would have made for more believability and more realism. Instead everyone seems to have the same opinion. I mean couldn't they have had the Yeoman stick up for him a little bit? 5. Eventually Spock does save the day twice, and ultimately makes the decision that leads to their rescue. Do they apologize for being total ass holes to Spock throughout the journey and show some gratitude for the difficult decisions he had to make? No. The episode ends with everyone laughing at him. (not just a few chuckles) literally the whole crew is doubled over in the most phony and forced laughter that I ever witnessed. Not only is this the pinnacle of cheese, but it just makes no sense. Of course it does make for great comedy to see such a poorly executed finale! Alright I've vented enough! it was still fun, but man I cannot get why anyone would give this episode anything more than 6 out of 10. If all Star Trek episodes were this frustrating I definitely wouldn't have bought the season on DVD. Luckily many episodes are much more entertaining.",5
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Galileo Seven (TV Episode 1967)","""You are a very stubborn man, Mr. Spock""","In dire need of a more serious tone after the humorous but somewhat inconsistent Shore Leave, Star Trek returns to its tradition of tackling deeper themes from a sci-fi point of view, focusing in particular on Spock's interactions with the rest of the Enterprise crew.This time, Kirk's mission is to bring medical supplies to the inhabitants of Markus III as quickly as possible, and his superiors keep reminding him of that priority. However, his priorities change when the smaller vessel Galileo, containing Spock and six other men (hence the episode's title), lands on a hostile planet and requires immediate assistance. With Kirk torn between duties, it's up to Spock to come up with a solution, but his adherence to logic doesn't sit well with some, most notably Boma (Don Marshall), whose behavior comes close to bigotry.Racism and the implications of being in charge: those are the two key topics of this suspenseful Trek tale, and both are handled admirably thanks to the writers' focus on the tense relationship between the half-alien Spock and the entirely ""human"" crew under his command, while William Shatner is elegantly sidelined as far as the drama is concerned. Then again, Spock has always been the more interesting of the two leads, and Nimoy relishes every opportunity he gets to show a little of the Vulcan scientist's complex, enthralling (and, a rarity for science-fiction shows, Emmy-nominated) personality. In addition, no need to worry about excessive darkness: the deft humor returns in the final scene, which contains one of the absolute best exchanges between Kirk and Spock. Sci-fi doesn't get much more fun than this.",9

Three people will have to be left behind at any rate, but fortunately two get killed by the local population, who are very tall beasts wearing large furry coats. Pretty bad special effects here, sorry. Adding to the pressure, a Federation big wig is pressuring Kirk to pull away and leave the abandoned crew behind, to deliver medications urgently needed elsewhere in the galaxy. Nimoy's performance here is stellar and his character is established. We also see Kirk's dedication to his crew. Great show aside from the very silly Big Foot characters.",9
14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Galileo Seven (TV Episode 1967)",A Misunderstood First Officer,"This is as much about the dynamics of the crew as it is routine plot. The Galileo 7, a shuttlecraft, lands with quite a large crew on an M4 planet (that is like Earth). The crew becomes trapped by giant, ape-like aliens. Survival becomes and issue as crewmen are killed. Strangely, some of the most important members of the crew are along for the ride. Of course, like most television, you have to have your principle actors performing, so send them on their way. Kirk probably didn't deal with the networks at the Academy. Anyway, Spock is forced to assert his cold-hearted being among a group of people who can't look at the practical side of their predicament. For instance, with their lives in imminent danger, the issue of burying the dead is pushed by the others. Spock risks his life to retrieve a body, but he is right in that such an act could lead to greater consequences. The crew becomes almost racist and impatient with the famous Vulcan. There is also the issue of a directive from a Starfleet official who wants to leave the whole bunch behind. That situation was reprised more than once in future episodes. This is really quite a good episode with many twists and turns and I feel Spock is quite admirable under pressure.",8

Gaetano's death I found scary with the giant Neanderthal trapping him against a cliff with a slow menacing approach before killing him.I felt sorry for Spock in this episode, I thought Lt Boma was way out of line and was lucky not to have been disciplined. It would have been nice to have seen Don Marshall in further episodes. It is interesting that Don Marshall who played Boma, starred in this episode of being trapped on a planet of giants and he later starred in Land of the Giants!",9
16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Galileo Seven (TV Episode 1967)",Loved it!!,"This episode was great!!! Loved that Kirk wasn't the central focus for once. The constant tension between Spock and the rest of the shuttle crew was realistic. And I cracked up at the following exchange:Scott: Mr. Spock, you said a while ago that there were always alternatives.
Spock: Did I? I may have been mistaken.
Dr. McCoy: Well, at least I lived long enough to hear that.Did you notice that Uhura was also instrumental in saving the shuttle crew - by bringing to Kirk's notice the only planet that could sustain the shuttle crew's life and thus steering them to it? And was involved in transporting them back aboard safely?",10
17,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Galileo Seven (TV Episode 1967)",I'm with Spock on This One,"In ""The Galileo Seven"", the Enterprise is delivering medical supplies to a planet currently suffering from a deathly plague. For whatever reason (because they have time to kill before their rendezvous I guess), Kirk decides to stop for a quick investigation of a quasar they are passing by. The shuttlepod Galileo is sent out to get close to it but an ionic storm within the quasar scrambles the technologies of the Enterprise and Galileo. Spock and the others aboard the shuttle craft crash land onto an unexplored planet in the middle of the quasar. With no sensors to find their crewmen, the Enterprise must figure out a way to locate the Galileo before its duty to deliver the medical supplies forces it to leave the crewmen for dead. Spock and company must survive on the planet's surface, fending off the giant creatures that live there.From a character development standpoint, I really like this episode. It highlights the personality of Spock and shows us how Spock thinks. I love the shots we get of the shuttlepod cruising around in space. These parts are good. That being said, I have a lot of issues with the plot of this one.First off, why are we stopping to do this side mission? It's not worth jeopardizing the lives of the sick waiting for these supplies. Kirk needs to prioritize here.Boma is a terrible and inconsistent character. The crew of the Galileo are acting like Spock is being a heartless robot when all he is doing is making good decisions. No sane person would be out there doing a funeral service, risking a spear to the head! People's self-preservation instincts would kick in in this situation. There would be no thought of any burial ritual. Spock is the only character that is relatable in this episode. He doesn't always make good decisions though. I understand him not wanting to kill a cognizant life form but his decision to leave a crewman to ""guard"" against the creatures is stupid. 1) The creatures could attack the Galileo from any number of directions so having him stationed where he is doesn't do much good. 2) Why not just guard the ship from a close proximity? It looks like he's far away from the ship. Why? They don't even hear when he gets attacked; that's how far away he is. (Part of me wants to think Spock did this on purpose, using logic to understand only 5 could fly in the ship. This crewman is the sacrificial lamb. Vulcans are humanitarians though so this is unlikely.)Despite these grievances, I still enjoyed this. It has fast pacing, good character development, and a satisfying conclusion.",7
18,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Galileo Seven (TV Episode 1967)",Disappointing badly written episode. A poor start for Mr Spock.,"Although this is the first episode to truly focus on Spock, it is marred by poor writing. The dilemma (and the suspense) of Spock having to choose who stays behind is immediately canceled by the lack of fuel and the death of the Guards. The opposition between Spock's logical decisions and his crew's more ""human"" opinions becomes repetitive. It is the only theme in the whole episode. Spock's decisions are actually not very logical at all: why leave one crewman behind? Why go alone to search for the missing crewman? Why bring him back if he is already dead?... The last decision he makes, which was supposedly emotional and borne of desperation felt the most logical to me. It was the only chance to be seen by the Enterprise, and it worked. Leonard Nimoy does his best with the slight and repetitive material. The other actors are nothing special.This felt like a very frustrating episode to me. Badly directed too. The furry creatures and their weapons are ridiculous. It would have been better if they were not even shown. It seems to be based on the same premise as the movie ""Five Came back"", but that film was much more interesting, more thrilling and had much better character development and acting. Catch it instead!Luckily not all Spock-centered episodes were this poor!",4
19,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Galileo Seven (TV Episode 1967)","This is awfully dull, but it is a good episode for Spock as a character","For the most part, all the episodes up until this one kept Spock in the background--allowing him no room to grow as a character or have all that much screen time. However, this is definitely his episode--as he is in command of a group aboard the shuttle craft (the Galileo). And I liked how the Vulcan logic, for once, was quite inadequate to handle a situation where logic was NOT the best approach to their dilemma. He tried using reason to predict the actions of a group of savage humanoids who were like giant cavemen--or so we think, as the folks at Paramount Studios/Desilu were too cheap to show them!! Instead, you saw bits and pieces and heard about them or saw shadows, but that was all! The problem is that this episode, despite its emphasis on Spock, was incredibly dull compared to the average show. Sure it's watchable, but that's all. I think a lot of the problem was the script. In particular, the crew members seemed awfully disloyal and were like a bunch of ""armchair quarterbacks""--always second-guessing Spock. This tension seemed out of place and it just did nothing to help improve the overall image of the series.",6
20,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Galileo Seven (TV Episode 1967)",Entertaining but slightly misleading,"In this episode, Spock, along with six other crew-members, crash lands onto a seemingly barren and desolate planet in a shuttle, while the Enterprise cannot find them due to interference from a quasar.There were many enjoyable aspects of this episode: it was good to see Spock have a larger role, and the episode allows the audience to study how he reacts under pressure, and how his crew-members respond to his decisions. While Spock's half-human side did show on one occasion when he seemed to display signs of anger, he maintained a coolly rational perspective for most of the episode, a consistency which makes Spock one of the greatest TV characters of all time.Of course, most of the crew-members (including Bones, as always), got angry with Spock due to his logical - and indeed correct - utilitarian view that, if necessary, three people should be left behind on the planet so that the shuttle can achieve escape velocity from the planet. They were also angry that Spock believed, again correctly, that there was no time to hold burials for the two crew-members who ultimately perished. While the writers may have been trying to portray the humans as being correct, I still enjoyed these parts of the episode - the dialogue between McCoy and Spock is always humorous.My problems with the episode came when the writers used the 'Straw Vulcan' trope. Indeed, they presented Spock's logic as dictating that the hostile aliens on the planet should not have been fired upon, even though this is probably not the logical decision to make. Furthermore, when they managed to get off the planet's surface and into orbit, they presented Spock's decision to jettison the fuel to produce a distress signal as an 'emotional' decision, even though it was clearly a logical decision: they only had 45 minutes to live anyway before orbit failed.As a result, at the end, the crew-members on the Enterprise were taunting Spock for having made an emotional decision, even though it was a logical one, which does highlight Hollywood's bias against 'logic' and 'rationality' in favour of more human decisions, even though the human decisions, in reality, are often wrong, as psychology has shown us.",8
21,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Galileo Seven (TV Episode 1967)","Accurate assessment of leadership qualities, but misleading indictment of 'logic'","This episode wasn't too bad overall. Basically, Spock leads a mission of six other officers in a shuttlecraft (hence the ""Galileo Seven"") that ends up stranded on a planet with hostile ape-like creatures. Kirk has a time limit to find them. Spock's complete lack of compassion infuriates his comrades and makes him an ineffective leader.The main point of this episode appears to be the following: logic sometimes leads to bad decision making, so emotionality must be factored in. I don't really buy it. I do agree that showing compassion and concern would have made the rest of the crew more likely to follow Spock-- so, for these reasons alone, Spock is rather ineffective as a leader due to his dispassionate element. If for no other reason, emotionality would have led to greater loyalty and hence greater group cohesion and so would have helped.However, I disagree that ""emotionality"" would have led to better decisions. Spock wasn't acting in the ""most"" logical fashion, not by a long shot. This was a classic situation involving decision making under uncertainty-- they just didn't have all the facts. They had minimal information about the creatures and so could not hope to accurately predict their future behavior. Under such circumstances, the ""correct"" decision depends on the decision maker's risk attitudes and valuation assessments, and so has an inherently ""subjective"" element. That's not the same at all as meaning that pure emotionality should act as a guide.Spock's ""error"" here was in arbitrarily placing a large amount of value on the lives of ape-like creatures relative to the lives of his crew, and in being willing to take very large risks with safety of the crew as a result-- by using very minor, ineffectual force against the creatures, which ultimately failed, very badly, as a deterrent. Most human commanders would likely have made the opposite valuation assessment.There was nothing more ""logical"" about Spock's valuation and risk assessment attitudes. Under such circumstances, there really should have been some sort of Starfleet regulation requiring a field commander to err on the side of safety of the crew. In the absence of any such regulation, I agree that Spock is a poor choice of leader because his values do not closely match those of most humans. He is much more effective in a pure support role, where he can provide information, without making the ultimate decisions.The part where Spock sends out an emergency ""distress"" call at the end was actually a fairly rational one. The odds of their being found without it were probably infinitesimal, even if the Enterprise was still in the region looking for them. On the other hand, on the slight chance that the Enterprise was still around, it gave them a decent shot of being detected. So I would argue that the difference was a small chance of survival (maybe 0.2%) with Spock's actions, vs. almost none at all (maybe 1 x 10^-10) without it. So, curiously, his supposedly ""human"" decision was probably the most rational one he made in the entire episode.",5
22,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Galileo Seven (TV Episode 1967)","""Mr. Scott, there are always alternatives"".","This was the first Star Trek episode to give Leonard Nimoy's character the spotlight, with Captain Kirk relegated to a position aboard the Enterprise in a secondary backup role. The episode further developed Spock's character as a creature of pure logic, but that doesn't mean it didn't get a little tiresome along the way. Granted, the situation the members of the Galileo shuttle-craft found themselves in didn't leave a lot of discretionary time to deal with their situation, but I think Spock could have reasoned with his crew a bit more diplomatically. But then again, crewman Boma (Don Marshall) wasn't making things any easier insisting on proper burials for the men who were killed. I mean, they were going to be dead a long time, and the objective, correct me if I'm wrong, was to get the heck off of Taurus II. Fortunately, Spock's resolve wins out, with finely timed reasoning as the basis for having an emotional outburst that saves the crew. Not that he would see it exactly that way, but it was good enough to close the story on a light note, even if it was at Spock's expense.",7

24,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Galileo Seven (TV Episode 1967)",The Galileo Seven,"One of many masterpieces during the Classic Star Trek series has Spock dealing with plenty of hardships in what is his first command, leading a small accompaniment on a mission, on board Shuttlecraft Galileo Seven, to explore a quasar of unusual formation. You see, The Federation considers it a duty for the Enterprise to explore all quasar-like formations/phenomena, for scientific study. But the Enterprise is duty-bound to carry medical supplies to Machis III, for use to cure a ravaging plague on the New Paris colonies. When ionic radiation causes technological disruptions to the Galileo, it crashlands on the only planet right at the heart of the quasar, with the also-effected Enterprise trying to find the missing crew, sensors and transporter unable to pick up their location. That isn't all Spock encounters during his first command. While grasping to logic to command, Spock will perhaps have to embrace his human side to come up with answers to save himself and his crew from unforeseen dangers, such as Neanderthal lifeforms of great height, tossing giant spears at them, short fuel supply left for the shuttlecraft, and a possibility of leaving three crew members behind on the planet due to issues in lifting off. Most of all, his officers are losing faith in his abilities to command, become fed up with his dependency solely on logic to determine the important factors towards their survival and lifting off, and his inability to acknowledge the loss of certain crew members killed by the planet's menacing inhabitants in a humane way. One crew member, Boma (a passionate, always-speaking-his-mind character played with conviction by Don Marshall) even labels Spock a machine after a fiery exchange regarding the burial of a dead officer. The crew consists of Spock, Bones, Boma, Scotty, Yeoman Mears (Phyllis Douglas), Latimer (Rees Vaughn), and Kelowitz (Grant Woods). While Scotty spends all of his time making repairs to the shuttlecraft, Spock surveys the situation and orders the others to follow certain commands, leaving poor Latimer alone at one point to keep an eye out for the creatures believing their phaser fire in directions near the lifeforms would scare them—the result is the death of Latimer and the furious retaliation of the creatures. Meanwhile, Kirk has to contend with an annoying commissioner on board the Enterprise to make sure he delivers the supplies to Machis III on time, and Ferris (John Crawford) is always there to remind the Captain of how much time remains for him to search for the Galileo crew. What you always get with great episodes like this is emotional fireworks and tightening tension as Spock resorts to an act of sheer desperation (although he says logic required the decision) to try to send out a ""distress signal"" to the Enterprise, and the constant questioning of his judgment and lack of emotion by the likes of Boman and Bones adds extra sizzle to the steak. The episode really wrings plenty of suspense out of the plot, that's for sure, even having Kirk setting a course for the next destination despite no contact and reports from the Galileo crew. That agonizing decision is quite visible as Kirk hangs on to a slender thread of hope until no more time presents itself. Good fun.",10
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Squire of Gothos (TV Episode 1967)","Intellect Without Discipline, Power Without Constructive Purpose","An apt description by Spock of an all-powerful fop into whose clutches fall the crew of the Enterprise. This was one sector of space our starship should have avoided: first Sulu & Kirk simply disappear off the bridge; a landing party follows them to the surface of an unknown planet and encounter Trelane, a seemingly aristocratic man dressed in attire from an Earth of many centuries past. But he demonstrates abilities of someone or something far beyond human and doesn't register on McCoy's medical tricorder. The officers manage to escape back to the ship but, like some bad cosmic penny, Trelane keeps popping up. He brings them all back, including some female companionship, to continue his games. The dilemma now takes on elements of 'The Most Dangerous Game' out in space and there's an exasperating, even infuriating aspect to the crew's utter helplessness before such unbridled power.What really makes this a great episode is the memorable performance by guest star Campbell as the overpowering but not all-knowing alien. His character is obviously an early version of Q, who was introduced 20 years later in the pilot for the TNG series. Trelane's confrontation scene with Spock stands out among all the strange drama which unfolds. As usual, Kirk quickly begins to look for possible weaknesses in his new nemesis, despite being quite outmatched. The answers to exactly what or who Trelane is are right in front of us the whole time so, when we do learn the truth, it makes complete sense in view of Campbell's pitch-perfect acting. He indulges himself constantly, preening before some unknown audience, remarking on things with a flair which is infectious but not quite right - we can't quite pin it down at first, but there's something missing here. Every few minutes, his tone becomes sinister and the crew now appears to be in serious danger. In a way, you can't take your eyes off him, always waiting to see what he does next. Actor John de Lancie captured that similar tone as Q on the Next Generation series.",8
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Squire of Gothos (TV Episode 1967)","Similar to, but much better than, ""Charlie X""","This episode had many similarities to the earlier episode, ""Charlie X""; it involved an immature brat with immense (but not infinite) power. But the story was handled in a much better fashion here.Here, the ""brat"" (Trelane) is indeed very powerful, but his power is mediated through external devices. That, alone, was a large improvement over ""Charlie X"", where the source of the punk kid's powers were almost totally unexplained.Here, Trelane's motivations, while juvenile, are readily understandable; he wants to 'play' and have 'fun' with his 'pets', failing to appreciate that they are intelligent beings with thoughts and feelings of their own. Trelane is closer to an 'innocent' who actually doesn't seem to understand or fully appreciate, yet, that his actions are wrong. Charlie, on the other hand, seems well aware that murder is murder-- yet he casually commits it, all the same, when someone isn't ""nice"" to him, which is far more sinister. Trelane is certainly very annoying, but just doesn't seem as malevolent as Charlie.Here, Kirk and Spock did a good job in exploring all alternatives. First, Kirk tried reasoning with Trelane. Then he staged an almost successful escape, with Spock's help. Then, he stalled for time for his ship. While it is true that, in the end, he was only saved by Trelane's parents, he at least did what he could, under the circumstances.And, of course, the ending was more satisfying. This episode didn't have a ""happy"" ending, exactly, but it was certainly less of a downer than the ending in ""Charlie X"".I've seen this episode many times as a kid, and it holds up surprisingly well, all these years later.",7
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Squire of Gothos (TV Episode 1967)","""You will hang by the neck, Captain, until you are dead, dead, dead!""","The Squire of Gothos is one of the ""sillier"" episodes of Star Trek, and therefore one of the most entertaining ones. The entertainment factor is, generally speaking, fueled by the stand-off between William Shatner and the episode's hilarious guest star, William Campbell.During an unspecified routine mission, Sulu suddenly vanishes into thin air, and Kirk follows soon after-wards. Spock immediately begins looking for his missing colleagues (and, though he'd hate to admit it, friends), while the two stranded crewmen must deal with the mysterious, all-powerful, flamboyant Trelane (Campbell), the self-proclaimed Squire of Gothos, a being capable of creating or destroying anything he wants through the sheer power of his mind.At first sight, the plot may seem recycled from previous episodes (honestly, are there any sci-fi shows that didn't feature at least one God-like character), but that feeling vanishes pretty quickly thanks to the script's winning use of exaggerated humor, all conveyed through Campbell's deliberately camp performance: his Trelane is essentially the Trek version of a spoiled child in the body of an adult, while his ignorance-fueled curiosity for the human race (his knowledge is quite limited) probably served as inspiration for Gene Roddenberry when he came up with the character of Q for the Next Generation pilot, some two decades after this episode aired.In short, the key to appreciating The Squire of Gothos is this: ""silly"" doesn't necessarily equal ""bad"".",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Squire of Gothos (TV Episode 1967)","God of war, or naughty little child?","What is it that compels two factions to engage in conflict with one another? What propels them to a state of warfare? An exercise whose only product is the destruction of life? How can sane and mature men engage in such a practice? The ""Squire of Gothos"" examines a possible explanation for this proposition. Kirk and crew must escape and evade a wandering planet controlled by a being who has all the respect for life that a sadistic child might when it levels a magnifying glass and sunbeam at an unsuspecting ant. Said child gets a sick thrill out of this. But can we blame the child? Does it know enough not to do what it is doing? It is, after all, an undeveloped mind--not having reached full maturity. But is this really an excuse? Excuse or no the author of this episode offers it as a possible explanation to the fascination of warfare by a certain kind of adult. The child reads or hears tales of gallantry on the battlefield, and wants to act ""grown up"" by mimicking said deeds and his heroes. But, because he is a child, he knows not the peril of the bloody pastime he hopes to partake in.All boys (and some girls too I guess) went through the period of playing ""cops and robbers"" or ""war"" prior to adolescence. For some people that little boy never leaves. Sometimes that's a good thing. Sometimes it's bad. ""The Squire of Gothos"" is slightly farce by sending up a caricature of the proverbial brave yeoman on a 18th or 19th century battlefield. Trelane is a parody of the idolatry that surrounded and generated the myths of battlefield heroics, and shows the audience the absurdity of lionizing the image he portrays.What's worse is that Kirk and the Enterprise are powerless to stop him. The episode becomes fairly symbolic and drives home a very poignant message near the end. It is ultimately a parental responsibility and obligation to their fellow man to raise and reign in their child and his behavior.Were it only that simple when it comes to armies clashing on the battlefield.Science fiction at its thematic best.Enjoy.p.s. the ""Q"" comparison is apt, but is really a minor cog in a much larger clockwork of symbolism.",

A lot of extremely unlikely and nonsensical stuff seems to be happening, and Trelayne seems obsessed with the human practices of warfare and murder. He seems to need to experience what he imagines to be a thrill and has created a human environment (though a few hundred years out of date) in which to play out his fantasies. The environment is subtly inauthentic, and the crew immediately begins to spot the inconsistencies. Pretty soon it becomes clear that Trelayne is not just an immature god, but a very fallible one. Regardless of how you feel about this one, stick around for the Twilight Zone-like ending. It is well worth it.As many have pointed out, Trelayne's character inspired the more developed and amusing on-going character Q - and you can see in John DeLancie's construction of that personality more than just shades of Campbell's Trelayne. It is fun to compare how the four captains we have seen coping with Q all deal with him so radically differently.",7

Apparently, Trelayne was an early attempt of the Q continuum. The Next Generation explains a couple of episodes from the 60's series, and Deep Space 9 dedicates an episode from ""The Trouble with Tribbles"".

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of each of these gods (or, at least, the BEST of them) were the actors who played them. One of my favorites has always been the flamboyant, foppish portrayal by William Campbell. At once petulant and sinister, Campbell's Trelane is a god to be reckoned with, a childish Being with the Power to kill with but a single nasty thought or an eyebrow-arching frown (or a flick of the wrist). The antique-cluttered set is the perfect setting for Campbell's performance: we see the artifacts from a dozen cultures (including an apparently stuffed specimen of the ""salt vampire"" from the episode THE MAN TRAP, which Trelane casually disintegrates when trying out a ""new toy""- a phaser). Another one of the episodes that helped make STAR TREK a memorable series and the backbone of a billion dollar franchise.",10

Sure, the histrionics were kind of funny for a while, and the ending was a pretty good way to wrap the whole thing together. I think the problem was that I enjoyed seeing Trelane when he was full of bravado and fun, the fun seemed to vanish when Trelane became vindictive and nasty. Talk about a mood killer--going from the obnoxious but affable host to the guy sentencing Kirk to death! But, despite this, the episode was enjoyable and worth my time. For die-hard Trekkies, this is a must-see, for others it's just a pretty run of the mill one.",7

A search party must head to the planet's surface where they encounter a strange man of 18th century sensibilities holding their crewmen as hostages.This one reminded me a lot of ""Charlie X"". The two episodes both center around a ""child"" with god-like powers not yet mature enough to handle their own capabilities. In both instances, the antagonist's downfall is some type of parental figure that comes to retrieve the boy, ending their playtime. While Charlie was an actual teenager with teenage hormones and an obsession with girls, Trelane seems more like a prepubescent obsessed with war, violence, and the history of humanity. His appearance as a middle-aged man causes the viewer to elevate Trelane's stature in their own minds, not realizing his infancy until his temper tantrum at the conclusion of the episode.So what is this episode really about? Are we just the playthings of the gods? Are we on a plane so far below other beings that even their children can discard the human race on a whim? A scary thought! While similar to ""Charlie X"", I think this episode is slightly better than its predecessor. (I gave them both a 7 so it's extremely close).

Campbell takes a juicy, well written role and absolutely sinks all 32 of his teeth into it. Though the ending does provide an amusing twist, it's also a total deus ex machina that keeps the episode from completely sticking its landing.Campbell also appeared in another famous Trek episode, as the Klingon Kioloth in ""The Trouble with Tribbles"".The character Trelane is notably similar to that of Q from The Next Generation.

They also find Sulu and Kirk, frozen like statues till Trelane unfreezes them. It emerges that he is fascinated by Earth having studied it from afar but due to the distances involved he believes Earth and its people to be like those at the time of Napoleon. In some ways Trelane seems superior but at times he is merely petulant; getting upset any time anybody challenges his authority. Kirk manages to get the better of him and they escape but as the Enterprise flees they find the planet in front of them again; they will have to face Trelane again and ultimately learn his true nature.This is an enjoyable episode thanks to William Campbell's performance as Trelane; he nicely captures the characters immaturity without overdoing it at least until his final scene and that was down to the writers. The way his interpretation of Earth is wrong is rather fun he has observed Earth but his recreation is flawed; food has no flavour and the fire gives off no heat. His encounters with the Enterprise's crew provide some nice moments such as a duel with Kirk and later a more deadly fight. The conclusion manages to be classic Star Trek but also a bit disappointing as Trelane isn't quite what he appeared to be. Still this is an episode that fans of the series will remember.",8

But stuck out there in space he's lonely. He wants the Enterprise crew for company. Only Shatner and his crew have work to do. Leonard Nimoy intrigues Campbell. He's studied earth, but he's only gotten as far as the 18th century. A Vulcan like Spock is something he can't account for. The very serious minded Spock has no time to deal with what Captain Kirk and the rest realize is an immature mind.

I had to think Captain Kirk was pushing the envelope with Trelane just a bit much considering the power he had already exhibited in bringing the Captain and Sulu down to begin with. Speaking of which, did you notice when the landing party first encountered Kirk and Sulu as 'specimens' in Trelane's exhibit, Kirk's eyes blinked when he should have been motionless.I guess I can't help it, but it's almost always Spock who gets my attention in these stories. Here we learn that his use of the word 'fascinating' is generally used for the unexpected. But it's almost always his sheer logic that crystallizes the situation for the viewer. Observing Trelane - ""I object to intellect without discipline. I object to power without constructive purpose"". I guess if Spock wasn't one of the original characters, he'd have to be invented to keep the show going.You know, I had to stop and think of who the actor was portraying Trelane. When he first appeared, I thought it was Liberace for a moment. That would have been so out of place for Liberace but I couldn't shake the idea. I read in the trivia section of this episode that the choice of Campbell to portray Trelane was meant to overcome what appeared to be the swishy nature of the character. I still think some of that came through, although it was tempered by the resolution of the story. Trelane was just a 'kid' who hadn't yet matured.

Spock finds him to be an incredible pest and for Trelane, the one thing he doesn't want is a lack of respect. Kirk has to play the guy's games in order to figure out what is going on. One of his female crew get into the act, enjoying her role as Cinderella. There are castles and silly sword fights and all kinds of stuff that would have been better on Lost in Space.

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. Unlike any other hit series, it only has 3 seasons so luckily it means that they will be covering up all their ideas within it until they are satisfied. As it often happens, the first season is always promising and has potential (or else it won't lift up for further more seasons) in it and is utilized with fine detailed work like focusing on different new breeds and characters bonding through this journey.The Squire OF Gothos had an interesting concept and it keeps you on edge of the seat from the first and the plot thickens on the second one where the skills are displayed to its peak but unfortunately the last act is quite dull and disappointing resulting it into a mundane episode.",

He is basically a child looking to amuse himself at the Enterprise's expense. But Kirk and company (even Spock who doesn't find him fascinating as much as ""interesting"") tire of his nonsense quickly, but finding a way to escape him will be quite difficult. William Campbell is essentially a precursor to John de Lancie's Q. He has great power and is quite mischievous and dangerous to boot. But like Q, although there are threats that could endanger Kirk and company, despite the powers available to Trelane he's so childish at times and silly there is never any doubt that he'll eventually be a foil due to not taking the humans seriously. Despite the advantage afforded to Trelane, Kirk is cunning and cleverand fortunate that Trelane has ""parents"" who have to scold their child for his immature games. Honestly, I thoroughly enjoyed Campbell, and seeing how his behavior annoys and irritates the Enterprise crew makes for some entertaining moments. It is an ""exhale"" type of comic episode often found in series when the leads have often dealt with intense, terrifying, or complex situations which leave us quite drained. For instance, this episode came after ""Galileo Seven"" when Spock had to endure the perils of command, dealing with debating crew members with him during a heavy ordeal, questioning his leadership. Although Kirk once again has to outwit a ""superior"" being (sometimes despite having powers that cause humans to be disrupted and disturbed of activities and duty, aliens and beings with advanced abilities might still be put in their place or convinced that ""inferior creatures"" have their merit, deserved of respect and perhaps not altogether worthless), he has help when it appears he has little place left to turn. Campbell has quite a showy part as the chatty nuisance who wants to ""play with his pets"", creating whatever he wishes (like a spare courtroom set with Kirk on trial or a jungle for which he'll hunt Kirk for ""sport"") and forcing the humans to do certain things (he can take them from the ship and place them at a dinner table, ""urge"" Uhura to play the piano or freeze Kirk and Sulu into wax sculptures) with just the wave of his hand or think it so. The fun of the show is seeing how Kirk will shake his confidence and embarrass him. Spock even being rather bothered by him is especially funny; the scene at the end when Spock asks Kirk what Trelane's being should be considered in the Enterprise library, it is most amusing. Phyllis Douglas, as a yeoman also taken to Trelane's castle, is stunning in a period dress, leaving Kirk rather gobsmacked when she asks permission to change back into uniform. Kirk and Trelane actually dueling it out is surprisingly athletic and even physical at times (the sword is often avoided by Kirk through the use of a thick stick or through exertion by stopping his hand). Light-hearted romp was actually penned with an anti-war message! The similarities between Trelane's species and Q are striking. The fact that Trelane gets all giggly about humans as a war species, looking back at centuries prior, speaking about Napoleon and referring to Hitler through imitation, when first introduced, really sets up how artificial and surface he is...no substance at all as Spock muses.",7

During the pursuit, the Enterprise is seized by more powerful beings who send Kirk to a desert planet so that he can face his adversary: the reptilian Gorn. Whoever wins the duel will be set free; the loser will be destroyed, along with his ship and crew. Given the Gorn is much stronger than Kirk, the latter has to come up with an inventive strategy to survive.Of the many examinations of the futility of war that Star Trek has offered, Arena is undoubtedly one of the more interesting ones, all because of its central idea: the preconception that all conflicts must end with the total annihilation of one of the two conflicting sides. The episode's presentation of the villain also plays on man's natural fear of all things unknown or different, making for 45 minutes of intelligence and tension that still resonate four decades on (despite the fact that the Gorn is obviously a stuntman in a suit).",10

He or it hisses at Kirk and even speaks, promising a quick, merciful death - it certainly feels cold-blooded. It's based on a fairly famous short story by sf author Fredric Brown, though Gene Coon conceived the piece thinking it was original. That's because it's such a primal, simple plot which almost any writer could come up with: the essence of warfare is distilled down to the most basics of just two individuals, who go at it mano-a-mano (see also the TV Movie from 1970, ""The Challenge""). Though this episode is one of Trek's best action stories, it's also a commentary on the needlessly huge casualties which occur during a war: why sacrifice thousands of individuals when an issue could be solved by the death of just one? This story kind of points out that maybe our nations, instead of engaging in traditional war, should just send our best soldiers or leaders; let them fight it out, thereby saving many other lives. It sounds pragmatic, or maybe too clinical; either way, when it becomes as personal as it does here, the results may not be as expected.The episode begins at a shattered Federation outpost. The Enterprise was called over to the planet by a bogus call. There's some impressive set design here for a TV show; the outpost, though wrecked, still looks neat, with vaguely Roman-like architecture (catch those two globules at the entrance, representing symbols of the Federation). This episode also touches on a concept not addressed much in all the Trek shows: the possible intrusion by the expanding Federation into another civilization's space. Suppose we find a planet with no intelligent life; we begin colonization; then, several months later, we find out another society has laid claim to this region of space a year earlier. What happens now? The answer suggested here by Spock is - bring on the diplomats. In the 3rd act, everything shifts to an asteroid, where Kirk meets his deadly-looking opponent - the sudden shot introducing the Gorn still sends shivers down my spine, even if it is a man in a suit. The Gorn was revamped much later on the ""Enterprise"" show with computer FX, but I still prefer this slow-moving version. Kirk can outrun the Gorn, but the lizard-man is much stronger; it's an interesting contest. Kirk's solution in finding a method of killing the stronger enemy is a bit too pat, but nonetheless exciting.",9
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Arena (TV Episode 1967)","Good, if simplistic, with one flaw","I thought this was a good, if simplistic episode, with one major flaw.The set-up is good: Kirk comes across a Federation outpost in the outskirts of known space, where an alien race has massacred everyone except for one survivor who confirms their brutality. Kirk decides to seek vengeance, pursuing the alien ship. They come within range of some advanced civilization (the ""Metrons"") that deems both sides ""uncivilized"" and has Kirk and the captain of the other ship (the race is Gorn, a reptilian species of great strength, but slow moving) to fight it out on a nearby planet or asteroid; the winner is to be allowed to leave; the loser will be killed and his ship destroyed.The episode consists primarily of Kirk figuring out how to build a viable weapon with the limited resources on the planet surface, while being pursued by a more powerful, but slow moving, enemy. Predictably, Kirk eventually triumphs after a long and difficult struggle, and has the Gorn captain at his mercy. But he declines to kill him. The aliens are impressed that humans have the 'advanced' trait of mercy and so allow them to leave.Okay, so the message was simplistic enough, but not a bad one-- the Gorn may have attacked the Federation outpost because they viewed it as an incursion on their own space; Kirk perhaps shouldn't have jumped to conclusions but should have attempted negotiations out of respect for other sentient life forms. I'm not 100% convinced that the Gorn's excuse was sufficient or valid, but there was at least an argument that could be made that Kirk shouldn't have immediately leaped to violence as the solution.The flaw comes from the fact that the Metrons were utter hypocrites-- willing to utterly destroy one of the two ships for having the 'nerve' to commit violence in their vicinity. Umm, how is that any different from just letting them fight it out? Shouldn't the Metrons have just neutralized the conflict and transported both antagonists far out of their space, and from each other, if they were going to intervene at all? Otherwise, why even interfere, since they were going to destroy one of the ships anyway? Even at the end, the Metron who speaks to Kirk offers him the chance to destroy the Gorn ship, which he declines to do.I agree that the Metrons are worth negotiating with in the future-- but only because of their vastly superior technology, not because of their lofty ethics. Their 'morals' seem no more upright than those of the Federation.",6
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Arena (TV Episode 1967)",Not one of the first seasons finer moments,"I enjoyed this episode much more when I was a kid, growing up on Star Trek. The episode that brought us the memorable fight between Kirk and a 6' tall scaled down version of Godzilla (The Gorn Captain) is not one of the better thought-out first season episodes. It starts out strong - somebody has completely destroyed a federation outpost and Enterprise detects an alien vessel while the landing party is stuck on the surface. A brief engagement is followed by a long pursuit, as Kirk's desire for revenge mounts. Finally, both ships are stopped by yet another omnipotent advanced culture, The omnipotent alien power (The Metrons) exsplain that violence is not tolerated in their system and that the Gorn and Star Fleet are therefore unwelcome. And Kirk and his counterpart on the Gorn ship are transported to a planet to settle their dispute with hand-to-hand combat. To the victor goes life. To the loser - death for the entire crew. The Metrons have apparently adopted pacifism, but have no qualms about hypocrisy. Kirk's character is also somewhat inconsistent throughout this episode. The Gorn's lizard body suit is pretty cool looking, but his costume, as well as that of the Metron is straight out of Flash Gordon. Despite its high rating among some fans, I consider this episode somewhat dispensable.",5
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Arena (TV Episode 1967)",Kirk Goes Off Half Cocked,"When comparing Kirk to Picard, it's fashionable to say that Picard would rather talk his way out of a fight, whereas Kirk would shoot first and ask questions later. For the most part, that actually wasn't true (it depended on who was writing a particular episode). In this episode, Kirk saw a federation outpost blown away for no apparent reason, immediately assumed invasion, and took off after the attacking ship with the full intent of destroying it before it reached home. He was not without his reasons. The Enterprise had also received two faked messages, the first asking them to come to the doomed outpost on planet Cestus 3, and the second inviting Kirk and his officers to come ashore (with emphasis on their ""tactical aids""). It turned out both messages were a ruse to trap the Enterprise and its officers. Of course, as it turns out, when a third party superior race intervenes (a recurring theme in ""Trek""), we see that the truth is not so simple. But back to Kirk. This reaction is completely inconsistent with the way he had dealt with hostile aliens in other episodes. Case and point: The encounter with the Romulans just a few episodes earlier. He agonized over whether or not to attack them and possibly start a galactic war, after the invaders had clearly committed an act of war by blowing away FOUR federation outposts. Same for the Corbomite Maneuver. Kirk used force against the cube that was blocking the ship only when every other option had been exhausted, and only when it began emitting radiation. Kirk actually admonished a young lieutenant for being too quick to the trigger. Also, how is it that the ship's sensors didn't pick up the fact that the entire outpost on the surface of the planet had been destroyed (not to mention failure to spot any alien presence)? If the aliens were doing something to block the sensors, it wasn't explained. More likely it was an oversight. This was ultimately Roddenberry's responsibility, as part of the job of both the producer and executive producer is rewrites. This isn't the only instance where there's been a continuity problem with the series.All of that said, this is an entertaining episode, and one that points out that even in extreme circumstances, it's possible that things may not be all that they seem to be. And yes, the Gorn was probably the cheesiest looking alien in Star Trek history; possibly the only time this series sunk to the level of Lost in Space in the costume/effects department. According to some reports, the original story on which this episode was based was also the basis for the Outer Limits episode ""Fun and Games,"" although according to IMDb they have different authors.",7
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Arena (TV Episode 1967)",A very good episode despite really awful special effects,"This is a very good episode with a very good plot. The only problem for me is that the enemy (the Gorn) is really cheesy-looking--the head barely moves and looks like a crummy mask. Not terrible by 1966 standards, but today it looks pretty poor.Now as for the plot, it really rocked. The Gorn attack a Federation outpost and kill practically everyone with their super weapons. The Enterprise has no idea who these enemy are but they know they MUST kill them or risk further attacks. However, in pursuing them, they enter Metron space and these advanced beings are horrified by the seeming brutality of these two races. So, to end the problem, they place the captains of BOTH ships on a barren planet and let them fight to the death--and the loser's crew will then be destroyed.Despite a relatively simple plot, the episode has three different locales and is a good showcase episode for Kirk. Not the best, but definitely among the better episodes made.",8
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Arena (TV Episode 1967)",Hilarious...,"This is one episode I'll watch over and over because of the hilarious fight scenes between Kirk and the Gorn. Wrestling commentator Kent Walton used to make a lot of 'speed and agility'...well I wonder what he would've made of the Gorn!! Telegraphing his punches? He was using carrier pigeons. The actual storyline is a bit daft because the Gorns want the human 'invaders' off 'their planet' Cestus 3, yet they lure more humans there with a fake distress signal. This heralds the chase to the death where the Metrons intercede. Not a brilliant entry to the Star Trek legend, but the scenes on the asteroid are a laugh with the breathless lizard throwing huge polystyrene boulders at Kirk. Then later, Kirk's at the top of a cliff where there's a boulder waiting on the edge (that's straight out of The Roadrunner Vs Wile E Coyote!)...our poor giant lizard is industriously making a man trap below and Kirk looks at the boulder...then at the Gorn...and I feel for the Gorn just like I do for the poor Coyote because we know what's coming...poor bugger!This isn't really a classic episode, but an unintentionally very funny one.",
7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Arena (TV Episode 1967)",The Star Trek cheese shop is open for business,"'Arena' has always been one of my favorite TOS episodes, both for legitimate reasons and ironic. It is a good episode, examining the idea of casualties of war and man's heavy-handed expansion to other planets. An outpost is destroyed, the Enterprise pursues the Gorn ship responsible, and Kirk finds himself facing off against their captain at the will of the Metrons (""We will resolve your conflict in the way most suited to your limited mentalities"").This is where the fun begins. Gaze upon Shatner's grappling with a giant rubber lizard man at Vasquez rocks (there's a reason Trekkies make the pilgrimage to those rocks, and this is it). Lumbering moves, telegraphed punches and really fake boulders; that is what this episode is really about. One drawn-out and ham-fisted fight scene.This is just the right mix of thought-provoking and hilarious, and the Gorn has lived on as somewhat iconic for a reason. Maybe just a tiny step down in status from the Tribbles.9/10",9

Meanwhile, the Enterprise does battle with an enemy ship returning fire of phasers. Moving out of orbit so as to protect ""Kirk's ship"", the away team will have to somehow survive non-stop assault as the Enterprise engages in combat with an unknown enemy. Backing off after Kirk shoots a bomb into a mountain where creatures were dropping their own disrupters, beaming back aboard, the Enterprise will pursue the enemy ship as it leaves the area.Prepared to settle the score with the Gorn hostiles whose starship has entered high warp, heading for an uncharted solar system, Kirk and the Enterprise plan to intercept them, before they can reach their home world and plan a possible invasion. Within this uncharted solar system is a yet unnamed species known as the Metrons scanning both the Enterprise and Gorn ships, stopping them dead in space, soon forcing the captains of both vessels to fight to the death on a planet suitable to breathe. This planet has mineral deposits and natural ""weapons"" needed for battle and while Kirk acknowledges his advantages in agility and brains, he admits that the Gorn Captain (who has lizard-like features, making a slurping sound when it breathes and talks) has greater strength and stamina, seemingly impervious to hand-to-hand combative techniques. Ingenuity will have to be what Kirk relies on, taking what the planet provides (coal, diamonds, rope, sulfur, and bamboo) in order to use as a suitable weapon against the Gorn warrior who has fashioned itself a stave carved from stone.What this episode does extremely well is a number of things. First, it shows the capabilities of Kirk when faced when insurmountable odds in a fight for his life with a creature savage enough to offer quite a difficult battle. Second, it calls into question who are necessarily the ""invaders"" when the motives behind the attack on Sestus 3 are provided. Third, Kirk's readiness to follow the Gorn ship with plans to destroy it, placing the Enterprise in jeopardy as he stretches warp capability, risking the lives of his crew just so he can catch the enemy and destroy them in retaliation puts him at odds with Spock who questions such rash actions. And the battle on the ground actually establishes Kirk's compassion when contemplating the Gorn's actions for attacking Sestus 3 allows the Metrons to see humans as more than just primitive savages with little regard for life. There are lessons learned here by all and Kirk's homemade cannon is quite a concoction that definitely proves to be quite a weapon with some kick. The opening attack on Sestus 3 produces plenty of explosions, destruction, and evasive maneuvers as Kirk and Spock try to determine the best move to counter the bombardments, quite an impressive way to kick off the episode...it sets the stage for the later battle, where phasers and superior weaponry are not available, two lifeforms having to use what the planet provides to try and kill each other.",8
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Arena (TV Episode 1967)",Kirk And His Adversary,"Let's face it, the most far-fetched scene of the show is how Kirk constructs the rocket from the different materials in ""The Arena"". The Enterprise finds a planet where a terrible battle is going on between members of the Federation and a group who have claimed the planet for their own. Supposedly, the defenders of the station have attacked the Federation outpost because they themselves felt they were invaded. Kirk soon finds out that system of planets belongs to a mysterious race of beings who are indignant at the encroachment of their system by the Star Fleet. But that is not the only reason. Because of the battle raging on the planet, the Metrones decide to single out Captain Kirk to do battle with a massive warrior known as a Gorn. While this battle between only the two goes on, the Enterprise has had a lot of it's functionality disabled. By the Metrones it seems, a race of beings that are far superior to the humans(and Spock) in many ways. The first season of Star Trek has always been my favorite of all the Star Trek, and I must be indicted for my age. Yes, the shows are not high on the cinematic level in terms of effects. But there is a lot of morality and ethics in those first shows that is a major part of the episodes. The first season appears to be the best, and that is because of the screenplay of the episodes. It is very well-written, being the first season of an incredible new ongoing adventure in science fiction.",9
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Arena (TV Episode 1967)",Mastering the reptile.,"As mammals we have a layer of intellect and empathy that, for most of us at least, acts as a safeguard against relentless pursuit of territory and other material goods for the sake of all else. That primitive part that drives us forward is regulated by this sense of empathy and higher purpose (for lack of a better phrase).But, when it comes down to it, when man competes with himself, other animals, or nature itself, it is the inner reptile that drives us forward. We seek land and raw materials to gratify us and perpetuate the species. It is what keeps us going, and in this sense preserves us.So what happens when a species whose sole purpose is survival, and has starship weaponry to back it up? What happens when it confronts another species also bent on territorial expansion? The result; a clash.This first season episode is a bit in the low budget department, but the drama is not lost on the viewer. By today's standards the Gorn alien captain and space SFX are certainly primitive, but the story endures. Lifted from a short story by Frederick Brown, also entitled ""Arena"", Trek shows the conflict between Kirk and a reptilian alien who has brain and brawn to match Kirk's Star Fleet training... mostly.As another reviewer noted, we are also witnessing hypocrisy flagrantly thrown in the face of the two embattled starship captains by the Metrons, the so-called super-race of beings who force the two CO's to settle their differences on some far flung world (allegedly an asteroid). The would stop the carnage created by a starship on starship duel with their version of ultimate-fighting, complete with close circuit coverage for the bridge crew to watch.The Metrons claim superiority, but with their promise to destroy and kill the ship and crew of the losing captain, they demonstrate an astute inferiority, or rather an arrogance and condescension that the two starship captain, for all of their bluster of threatening the other side, do not stoop to. Both Kirk and Gorn, in spite of being high on a blood lust, do not thumb their nose with false promises.In the end Kirk succumbs to his inner mammal, and confronts the Metrons with their own devices. Or perhaps the Metrons were applying behavioral conditioning to one of Federation's finest? Testing the UFP to see what caliber of species they may encounter and interact with in the future? We don't know, but the hint is awfully strong.Other than that, it's a good old fashioned actioner with some moments of tension and a few thrills. The script is tight and it's a very well shot piece of TV sci-fi drama.Watch and enjoy.",

Soon both the landing party and the ship are attacked by unknown aliens. They manage to repel the attack and Capt. Kirk orders the Enterprise to pursue and destroy the attackers believing their destruction of Cestus III was a precursor to an attack on the Federation. The pursuit is ended when both ships suddenly come to a complete stop in an uncharted solar system; here they are contacted by a race known as the Metrons who beam Kirk and the captain of the alien ship to a remote planet where they must fight to the death; the crew of the loser's ship will share the fate of their captain. They are told that there are materials required to make weapons and Kirk will certainly need to find them if he is to defeat his much stronger adversary; a lizard-like creature known as a Gorn.This is one of the most memorably episodes of the original series partly due to the 'man-in-a-rubber-suit' Gorn and partly for the classic location; Vasquez Rocks used so often in Star Trek that they became known as 'Kirk's Rocks'. While the look of the Gorn is rather dated and almost comical the story is solid and doesn't shy away from the possibility that it may be the Federation who were in the wrong; the Gorn claim the outpost was built in their territory. The plot doesn't warrant too much scrutiny; the Metrons claim to be forcing Kirk and the Gorn captain to fight because they disapprove of barbarity but what they do is little different to letting the ships fight it out in space one might think they are testing the two for signs of mercy but they express surprise when Kirk spares Gorn to be fair though there is no rule saying beings claiming to be morally superior can't be hypocrites! There are some accidentally amusing moments when the crew on the enterprise view the action on the main screen Spock instantly recognises an innocuous white powder as potassium nitrate when it could be any number of more likely but less useful things. Overall despite its flaws I found this to be a highly entertaining episode.,8

The frequent accusations by the more advanced aliens that earth creatures are too violent is often counteracted by their own blood lust. In this episode, Kirk is pitted against the Gorn, a species of lizard man. Perhaps they could have done just a bit of work to animate his jaw, rather than making it look like a Halloween mask. This episode forces Kirk to draw on his knowledge of chemistry and warfare to face the Gorn. As the crew watches the fight continues. They parry and thrust their way. The strength of the episode has to do with lessons learned. McCoy gets in his usual shot at Spock for inaction. He seems to blame him whenever his logic doesn't solve the problem.",8
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Arena (TV Episode 1967)","""You are still half savage, but there is hope"".","I don't know why I can remember arcane goofy stuff from my childhood, I just do. In the Sixties, I had a DC Action Comic featuring a Superman cover, the lead story having to do with the Man of Steel brought to a red sun planet where he had no super powers. While there, he was forced to do battle with the champions of other planets to decide who was the strongest being in the universe. One of the characters he had to face off against was... Borko of GORN!!! So as I'm watching the episode, I'm asking myself if there was some connection to this old Superman story. As Spock would say - 'Fascinating'.And speaking of Spock, he's not exactly buying Captain Kirk's rationale that the aliens the Enterprise is chasing are planning an invasion. That's brought home when the Metrons intervene and set up the hand to hand combat scenario between Kirk and the Gorn leader. The Enterprise and the Gorn ship were intruding into their section of space, and that of course is an intergalactic no-no.So, hopelessly outmatched in terms of brute strength, Kirk must rely on his agility and speed to buy some time and think his way out of this one. The resolution leading to that hand made weapon would have seemed much more imaginative if everything Kirk needed didn't just happen to be simply lying around. Think about it, where on Earth (or any planet for that matter) would you find diamonds, coal, sulphur and phosphorus just scattered about in plain sight? Well for those viewers who liked to think of Star Trek as a creature of the week show, this one was sure to satisfy. Almost two decades later, the theme would be reworked somewhat to give us ""Enemy Mine"", another tale of hand to scale combat. Besides one of the more memorable alien characters to appear in a Star Trek episode, this one also gave us the first mention and use of photon torpedoes, obviously more potent than phaser weapons. The show also had me running to the cast credits, as one of the helmsmen had an unusually uncanny resemblance to Jeffrey Hunter, known to Trek fans as Captain Christopher Pike.",8

Though the Gorn is criticized for looking ""Unrealistic"" I personally love it in here. A shame the Gorn didn't appear after this episode. As a Godzilla fan I don't have a problem with men in suits.

I don't want to overreact but that fight scene between Kirk and Lang might be the greatest fight scene of all time. Wow, are these effects terrible! Star Trek is usually pretty good at disguising their lack of funds and lack of special effects but not in this episode. I don't know who thought this would look good. Besides this though, the episode's pretty straight forward. The superior species treats the two battling ships like children throwing tantrums.

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. Unlike any other hit series, it only has 3 seasons so luckily it means that they will be covering up all their ideas within it until they are satisfied. As it often happens, the first season is always promising and has potential (or else it won't lift up for further more seasons) in it and is utilized with fine detailed work like focusing on different new breeds and characters bonding through this journey.The physical sequences are as mentioned earlier, petty and the execution of it too is a bit loose and since the most of the episode relies upon it, eventually it turns out to be disappointing but the tricks and skills depicted in here are surely plausible (Kirk basically created a canon in here).",

I may have not remembered correctly but in the original short story there was abarrier between the two ""beings"" and the Earth human through logic and deduction was able to figure out how to overcome the barrier and dispatch the alien.

How dare a SW fan have the audacity to criticize Star Trek! *DISCLAIMER: this is done with the utmost fun/love so any of you TREKKIES out there that feel the need to zip off a hasty/indignant reply with headings like: ""How dare you nit-pick a cherished franchise!"" ""Such-and-such was done because of the limited TV budgets back then"" ""It was made 50 years ago and was cutting edge stuff against the ordinary pabulum that was out back then and it changed the face of sci-fi forever so cut it some slack you sacrilegious bastard!!"" Reel in your indignation. *FYI - I know that most of you TREKKIES have a sense of humour (I'm Canadian, THAT's how we spell it here! We LOVE ""U's"" and use them whenever we can) and those that don't have one are called TREKKERS! If that is the case then as William ""the Shat"" Shatner once stated on Saturday Night Live ""Get a life!"" Of course the episodes I'm reviewing are the revamped ones with the new special effects so I will spare those purist Trekkies (I know I'm getting under your skins right now.. ha ha my evil plan is working) that cherish the original special de-fects. So I will commence in pointing out some glaring blunders in these cherished episodes.Today's episode ""ARENA"" -This episode is a smorgasbord worth of hack directing and shoddy Art direction -First off the destroyed Earth observation outpost is very ""Art directed"" with random debris scattered around that does not correlate to anything that has been destroyed; simple debris/structures that the ""Shat"" uses to show off his tuck-and-roll abilities while dodging enemy canon fire. Or is it canon fodder? -The production must have used up the budget building the impressive Colony set and had no monies left over to pay extras to pose as ""bodies"". Perhaps the colonists had the where withal/courtesy to crawl off into a corner and die rather than stink up the landscape? -During the attack, Kirk asks crewman Kelowitz's opinion of the enemy's location. Kelowitz is looking Screen left but the mortar (incorrectlycalled a grenade launcher by the Shat) is pointing Screen right. Apparently ""close enough"" is ""good enough"" when using Starfleet grenade launchers... I mean mortars. -In the sick bay, the wounded Lieutenant gives a fine example of elementary school acting when expressing a lack of understanding of the enemy's motive for the attack. I wonder if he used this clip as support material for his application to The Actors Studio? -Uhura screams like a banshee when Kirk disappears off the bridge it's not like she hasn't witnessed a being appear out of thin air before; like Trelane or anyone else who uses the transporter. Dah -On the planet, the Art department has made a rather lame attempt to convert Vasquez Rocks into an ""alien"" planet by the oddly scattered colored crap littered around that is absolutely inconsistent with natural coloring/vegetation/minerals with evolution in the galaxy. The foil paper is an exceptionally cheesy touch. It only draws the eye as to how corny it looks rather than just leave it as it is and give the foil back to the honey wagon to wrap the crew's sandwiches. -Science question: Why does the Gorn Commander fight and move like he's in 1st gear and in slow motion .WTF? Another bit of bad staging that would ""seem"" to justify Kirk's chances of beating the Gorn, me thinks. -On Earth Bamboo grows in tropical locations but here it grows out of solid rock and in very little clumps scattered around. Darwin would have a conniption fit on this planet. - As the Gorn is setting up his first ""trap"" for Kirk, he is actually heard on the soundtrack laughing to himself in a sinister way otherwise how would we know he's the villain? -I am not even going to point out the Wile E. Coyote boulder resting at the top of the cliff that Kirk attempts to hit the Gorn with yet unlike our fav ""super genius"" coyote, Kirk splatters our villain. -After the ""boulder"" scene, Kirk falls prey to the Gorn's ""cleverly disguised"" trap of a vine strung across his path and gets tangled up. Lucky for him the Gorn is still moving in slow-mo so he can do some pretty low impact escape moves. All the Shat's reactions are pretty slow and meandering, not what we have come to expect from James Kirk. Perhaps he didn't chug his Redbull that morning. -Now we get to my fav scene; Kirk sitting on a rock and talking to himself about his dire situation. He identifies the very bright/clean ""sulfur"" powder that is ""clearly"" not indigenous to the area but is lying in ""art directed"" blobs beside him. -Evidently there is no wind otherwise the sulfur and potassium nitrate would have blown away eons ago.This planet is an evolutionary miracle with bamboo growing out from rock formations, random chunks of coal, diamonds, potassium and coal lying around ready for the picking. -The Metrons seem to have adopted cheesy late 1960's CRASH-ZOOM lens shots as the crew is allowed to watch the tail end of the battle on the bridge viewing screen. -The bamboo ""canon barrel"" seems to be waiting for Kirk, no shots of him searching the landscape but simply finding one already cut to size, as well as rope, or rather an indigenous ""vine"" at his feet, quite a unique little oasis Kirk has stumbled upon.-The staging of all this is really lame. Director, Joseph Pevney, has helm-ed some of the better Trek episodes but he must have suffered from heat stroke in the desert that week to let such bad staging slide and f—k up a really good updated version of The Most Dangerous Game concept.",6
20,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Arena (TV Episode 1967)",Not a bad episode,"Not exactly one of my all time favorites, but not bad either. It's a little difficult to figure out exactly what all the motives are involved, but soon our Captain Kirk is pitted against a humanoid lizard creature in a contest orchestrated by a superior race, with a planet full of potential weapons. Unfortunately the weapons are in their raw form, but our Captain's wit will surely lead him to the victory. Which it eventually does. Then comes the climax. Our noble Captain refuses to kill his enemy. Something within him says he should show mercy, and obviously he doesn't have to kill the creature at that point. Overall a good episode, one that portrays the positive moral values for which the series became famous. I discovered three different men portrayed the Gorn, no doubt it was extremely physically taxing, potentially even dangerous to film while wearing that costume in the sun. All in all, a worthwhile effort and a decent episode.",7

23,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Arena (TV Episode 1967)",excellent episode!,"Once again, we have an excellent use of several of Star Trek's favorite tropes:* a Secret Test of Character (will Kirk overcome his revulsion and blood lust?)* a God Game (will Kirk or the Gorn Captain figure out the gunpowder weapon, all neatly laid out for easy assembly for anyone who thinks to notice?)* an Enlightened God/Angelic Race pretending to be less than they are (the Metrons masquerading at first as violent hypocrites as part of their Secret Test of Character of both Kirk and the Gorn Captain)* wry yet optimistic commentary on humanity (""You are still half-savage, but there is hope for you."")Enough people have described this episode already that there is no reason for me to go through its storyline again.In some ways, the clunky costume of the Gorn works better for the purposes of this story than would some of the more ""realistic"" designs in modern CGI. Accepting its flaws for the sake of the story encourages the viewer to enjoy the episode at a heightened level rather than at a dully literalist level, appropriate for a 1960s SF episode that doubles as a fable.The Metrons and the Organians are two of the best evocations of godlike races found in Classic Trek episodes (with Trelane coming in an uncertain but respectable third), though many commentators here seem to misunderstand them.The Metrons (said to be named after Metatron, the Voice of God in Judaeo-Christian tradition) appear at a superficial glance to be irrational and hypocritical: they tell Kirk & Company and the Gorns that they will not be allowed to fight and kill in Metron space only to place the respective captains in an arena to fight to the death with the threat that the loser's ship and crew will be destroyed. Near story's end, Kirk meets one of the seraphic Metrons, who then offers to destroy the Gorn Captain and his ship.But it is clear with any second glance that the Metrons already knew what would happen. The arena functions less as a battleground and more as a ""secret test of character"" (a common enough trope in the various Star Trek series over the decades). The Metrons are no hypocrites: their actions and Kirk's response only make sense if they know from the start what will happen (just as the Organians knew the future in a different episode), and the Metrons use this opportunity to teach (test) Kirk about mercy and empathy and, presumably, teach the Gorns about what it is like to be shown such mercy and empathy.For one thing, the raw materials for a gunpowder cannon have clearly been placed where they could be found in a condition in which they could be easily used by anyone with the cunning and verve to do so.More importantly, when the Metron first meets Kirk, within a few sentences he makes a joke about how killing Kirk and his crew ""would not be ..."" pregnant pause ""civilized"", smiling lightly and with an amused lilt to his voice. Then, when he offers to kill off the Gorn Captain and his ship, he seems wholly unsurprised that Kirk turns him down.Before the Metrons' intervention, Kirk was obsessed with hunting down and destroying the Gorn ship even though it would likely ignite an interstellar war; on the arena planet, Kirk admits to a further revulsion against the Gorn based solely on its reptilian appearance. Yet by the end of the episode, Kirk has progressed past his revulsion and hunger for vengeance enough to feel compassion for the Gorn Captain, to recognize that the Gorns may have had reasons for what they had done, and to hope to someday talk with and open relations with the Gorns.None of this would have occurred if the Metrons had left them alone to incite their interplanetary war or had simply disrupted their ability to kill each other. This is not hypocrisy on the part of the Metrons but an opportunity for enlightenment (another common Star Trek trope).Now, thanks to the Metrons' intervention, Kirk's report to Starfleet will advocate compassionate diplomacy with the Gorns and share also the wonder of having met the Metrons, rather than urge a blood-soaked war of vengeance and mammal-reptile xenophobia.An excellent episode overall!",9
24,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Arena (TV Episode 1967)",Some glaring mistakes,"Shortly after the episode begins, Kirk and a landing party go down to the surface to supposedly meet with people from one of their outposts. As soon as they arrive they see that the outpost has been destroyed. They find one of the people from the outpost and he is supposedly quite injured with internal injuries and Kirk instructs the doctor to keep him alive. However, if his injuries are that life threatening, he should not have been that alert and mobile. He was wiggling around quite a bit for someone so near to death.There is a chase scene which eventually ends up with the Enterprise and an alien (Gorn) ship being stopped dead in their tracks and then Captain Kirk and the Gorn captain are sent down to a planet where they are to duel one another. The initial fighting between the two of them is so lame. It is in slow motion and so incredibly fake looking. Later Kirk makes a comment that he cannot possibly fight the Gorn one on one as the Gorn is too strong and yet that is how they initially started the fighting and Kirk really was not that hurt. If his comment about the Gorn being that strong was true he should have been pretty close to dead already. He later pushes a huge boulder up a slight hill and over the edge. No way he had that kind of strength. The Gorn has rigged a trap that Kirk gets caught in and a boulder rolls on top of his leg. You can see that the boulder really isn't that heavy and if it had been a real boulder his leg would not have just been slightly hurt, it would have been crushed.Kirk then finds a large hollow tube and he starts filling it with potassium nitrate, diamonds, sulfur, etc. However, it is a hollow tube and he keeps carrying it straight up and down which means everything he has just put into would be falling out the bottom.Overall, an interesting episode, if cheesy at times. Another fine example of how humanity is not as violent and unmerciful as some seem to believe they are. I would have rated the episode higher if it weren't for the aforementioned issues.",6
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Tomorrow Is Yesterday (TV Episode 1967)",TOS explores its unfamiliar present,"This early D. C. Fontana episode bravely goes where TOS never went before - to the time of its own creation - the late 1960s. Another bold frontier for the series (previously explored, but less interestingly, in Squire of Gothos) was crossed as Tomorrow is Yesterday established the show's sense of humor by - characteristically - poking fun at its own historical context. The original series was never equaled in any of its worthy successors in making commentary - whether comedic or serious - on its own historical context. And though not terribly serious, Tomorrow is Yesterday is a good example.The plot is fairly complicated and as impossible (from a scientific perspective) as most of what passed for science in Voyager and Enterprise, but the strength of Fontana's dialog and the performances of the regular crew and the guest stars (Roger Perry is great in this) carries it. Enterprise, on its way to earth, is catapulted back in time by a slingshot effect relating to the gravitational pull of a star, to the late 1960s (ya, I know, a physics class might have helped here, but bear with me). The ship enters earth's gravitational field partially disabled and in a decaying orbit. They are spotted and branded a UFO, and a warplane is sent to investigate. The crew must figure out a way to repair the time line, return some unwanted guests to earth without memories of visiting the Enterprise, and, of course, return to the 23rd century without ripping the ship apart.The episode is well written, despite the ridiculous premise, and very nicely acted. The cinematography is effective, though the effects are some of the worst in the series, and many of the long range shots of the ship should probably have been cut. Kirk engages in one of his better fight scenes - if you're into that sort of thing.An entertaining episode, and one that established a trope for the entire franchise - engagement with the show's own historical context.

1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Tomorrow Is Yesterday (TV Episode 1967)","""I think we have a real UFO on our hands""!","There's a good reason time travel stories can make your head hurt; this one has a few of the ingredients. For my part, I tried wrapping my head around the argument of sending Captain Christopher (Roger Perry) back to the 1960's just before he was beamed up to the Enterprise in the first place. At that point he would have retained no memory of what he experienced. Well, who's to say that would be the case? What exactly would occur to erase those memories? BUT, presuming that to be true, why wouldn't the memories of everyone aboard the Enterprise be affected the same way? Weren't they 'slingshotting' their way back to a moment just before the opening scene happened? See what I mean, now my head hurts again.All that aside though, this is actually a pretty entertaining episode. The interplay between Captain Christopher and the the Enterprise crew makes for an interesting look at how representatives from different eras might react to each other. I thought Christopher might have accepted his situation just a bit too readily, but then again, what was he going to do? You know, when I heard Captain Kirk mention the United Earth Space Probe Agency, I really had to stop and think about that. United Earth. Now there's a concept. When do you think that might ever happen? Especially from the vantage point of watching these shows almost a half century after they were made. I guess that's why they call it sci-fi.",7
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Tomorrow Is Yesterday (TV Episode 1967)","If Tomorrow is Yesterday, What is Today?","We finally get to see Earth on the original Trek show, but wait! This is Earth in the 1960s! Wow, those black holes can really do a number on our starships in the 23rd century: one rubber band effect later and Enterprise is being chased by a sixties Air Force pilot aiming to nuke a UFO (nice stock footage). This was the first time travel story from Trek in which we visit Earth of the past (the others were ""City on the Edge of Forever"" and ""Assignment:Earth""). In the latter episode, the journey was made on purpose, following up on the accidental visitation here. This one threads a fine line between comedy and sf adventure. Especially amusing is the female-oriented computer that Kirk is stuck with here and the Air Force pilot's introduction to Spock. And the amusement continues with Kirk's slapstick fight with 3 military officers and their ineffective interrogation. Kirk is at ease here and cool as a captain can be.On the other side of the coin, we have the pilot (guest star Perry, in fine form), a sixties military version of Kirk, being told he can never go home to his family due to what he knows of the future - well, why did Kirk give him a guided tour of the ship? We know why: Kirk is instantly fascinated by this archaic (to him) version of what will eventually become Starfleet in about 200 years. The pilot is pretty much what Kirk would be if he'd grown up in the 20th century. Likewise, the pilot is fascinated by this glimpse into the future, especially in meeting Spock; he's not repelled as we might expect, overcoming any phobia with the grace that great training and an open mind brings. It's all a playful, colorful adventure - which completely falls apart in the final act when they start transporting/beaming people into themselves - but hey, whatever gets you home.",7
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Tomorrow Is Yesterday (TV Episode 1967)",Back to the '60s,"Tomorrow Is Yesterday introduces the most classic of Star Trek plot devices: time travel. After the original series, it was also used in the spin-offs (minus prequel show Enterprise) and three of the eleven - so far - Trek movies (The Voyage Home, First Contact and J.J. Abrams' reboot), always to great effect. This episode is no exception, especially as it gets more fun to watch as time goes by.The travel itself is actually just an accident: when a mission goes wrong and hostilities ensue, the Enterprise flies towards the Sun and then away from it as quickly as possible. This, the so-called ""slingshot effect"", causes the ship to end up orbiting Earth - in the late 1960s! Unfortunately, a pilot working for NASA notices the ship and is taken the hostage by Kirk and Spock, who must now come up with a way to get back home without altering the course of history.The usual elements of every good time travel story are all present: the discovery of a new age, the problems that derive from it and, of course, the discussions regarding possible paradoxes. What really makes the episode stand out, though, is its sense of fun and prescience: ordinary people's reaction to the sight of Kirk and Spock is always a joy to behold, and it's pretty funny to hear our heroes mention man's first landing on the Moon as taking place on a Wednesday at the end of the '60s: they got it right, weekday and all, a full two years before the whole thing happened.

While they try to determine what must be done Kirk and Sulu beam down to a base to recover photographic evidence retrieved from Cristopher's plane and this leads to beaming another unexpected guest aboard the enterprise!This time travel episode is reasonably fun but not particularly memorable. The conundrum of what to do about Capt. Christopher and the other man beamed up is solved a little too neatly in a way that leaves them with no memories of what happened. The situation does provide a few amusing moments; it is surprising just how funny it is what Mr Spock raises an eyebrow at their surprised guests and Kirk's interrogation at the US Air Force base was fairly funny. Further humour is provided by the computer, which has become somewhat flirtatious after reprogramming at a female dominated planet a gag that seems somewhat dated now.

What would someone from our time (roughly) think of their ways. I am very much borrowing from another reviewer here, I just happen to agree.The dialog is the main attraction here. The dialog involving captain Christopher, and kirk's infamous joking scene especially. Fans of the show, you know what I'm talking about.

This time, the starship is slingshot, thanks to a black star, to 1960s Earth, found by the Air Force in the sky, considering the Enterprise a UFO. Sighted by a pilot, Captain Christopher (Roger Perry), with his plane taking pictures and recordings of the Enterprise, Kirk has no alternative but to beam him on board. A tractor beam on the plane disintegrated, so beaming Christopher on the Enterprise was his only alternative. Even worse, Kirk will need to retrieve the footage of proof of the Enterprise, and Christopher's help might be of importance. The footage is on a base. But also of importance: getting back to their own time! The Enterprise suffered damage, which Scotty will need to repair. Kirk and Sulu (nice seeing Sulu involved in the action of the plot on a planet, especially Earth) beam down to the base to get the evidence, encounter a security guard who tinkers with a communicator and is also beamed to the Enterprise! So two 1960s Earth men on board the Enterprise are privy to the future, 200 years after them! Christopher must be returned to his own Earth due to an unborn son who will be key to how the future develops, significant due to space travel. This is fun if just because we see Kirk constantly trying to avert one time disaster after another. The Enterprise spotted, two military men seeing how the future looks like, Christopher attempting to free himself from the Enterprise, and somehow those who have proof must be returned to the time *before* they met the crew on the starship from the 23rd century. This slingshot might can be repeated using the Earth's sun, reversing what happened, but Scotty warned of possible risks if the engines react with malfunction. I reckon students of science might look at the episode with close scrutiny and balk at some of the time travel ""corrections"" (beaming the two Earth men who witnessed the wonders of the 23rd century exactly at specific moments before ever experiencing Kirk and company or a trip on board their ship), but I just can't resist these kinds of plots, and Trek rarely lets me down. Just the reactions of Christopher and the security guard (the soup scene for the guard seeing how the future brings food almost immediately, and Spock's comment on how he was frozen in shock are both quite funny) when seeing Spock for the first time is priceless. Nifty opening grabs you with the crew on the Bridge recovering from the slingshot which left the Enterprise with only impulse engines, having to recuperate after such a rough ride. The later effects work seeing the Enterprise in the sky of Earth is gnarly. Perry is really good, adapting to his surroundings the best he can, but determined to get back to his family and own time. Kirk contemplating ""keeping"" Perry on the ship, only to be undermined by Spock who informs him that doing so would be a time catastrophe, is quite a development...thankfully there is always a Trek solution when Kirk and Spock are involved.",8

Specifically, it comes off very sexist at times.Spoiler Alert So, of course the AI computer programmed by the female planet is flirty and randomly giggles.

19,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Tomorrow Is Yesterday (TV Episode 1967)",Well-meaning but kind of inconsequential,"Basically, the Enterprise is faced with a dilemma: they are forced to beam up an American pilot (Captain Christopher), who learns too much about the future; but they have to return him because his son will play a key role in the nascent space program. Both returning him, and failing to return him, threaten to alter the future.This episode appears to have been an attempt to see how contemporary humans would view the Enterprise, if it were to somehow go back in time. Much of it appears to have been intended to be humorous, although the extent to which it succeeds in that respect is questionable.Because this series originally ran during the mid-1960's, while the Cold War was still going strong, there is still a definite sense of paranoia and fear of the unknown that permeates the Americans. It is also almost quaint how Captain Christopher reacts to women in the military as a totally foreign notion. These things are understandable enough given the time that this series was made but offer a striking contrast with the current political milieu, while at the same time being not entirely unfamiliar in a post-911 world.The writing and acting were done competently enough, but, given the resolution that was almost ""required"", the story just doesn't amount to much.MAJOR SPOILER FOLLOWS: The entire episode feels kind of irrelevant by the end, because the Enterprise is able, by some technical mumbo jumbo, to return Captain Christopher to the moment just before the Enterprise beamed him aboard, with no memory of the subsequent events. In other words, the Enterprise neither polluted the time stream, nor interacted with it in any way at all (except for being briefly glimpsed by Earth radar and by Captain Christopher, before it just fades away).I appreciate that D.C. Fontana was apparently trying to give the viewer a sense of drama portraying the Enterprise as viewed through (then) contemporary sensibilities. But what was the point since nothing that happened in this episode was remembered or ""mattered""?",5
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Court Martial (TV Episode 1967)",Kirk finds out he needs a lawyer,"The title of this episode is self-explanatory: based on computer evidence, Kirk appears to have either panicked or, worse, acted with malice during a critical point on the bridge while one of those ion storms was raging, causing the death of a crew member with a push of a button. It turns out, Kirk has a long personal history with this Lt.Finney, who lost out on a promotion or two. Kirk is under fire in this episode not by some cosmic menace, science gone mad or warlike aliens but - perhaps more frightening to him - by Starfleet itself, the one entity you'd think would always back him up. We get to see some of the inner workings of this organization here and the proceedings are not really different from current military trials and bureaucracy ('regulations, captain'). We're back at Starbase 11, last seen in ""The Menagerie"" part one, but with a different commodore. I really liked the scene in the bar or lounge, where Kirk runs into some of his peers - it's a nice glimpse into Starfleet outside the usual parameters of just the Enterprise.The most memorable thing about this episode is the introduction of Kirk's lawyer, Cogley, played with some eccentricity by old-time actor Cook Jr. He jabbers on about thousands of books and tends to rattle off a list of old historical documents (including some we've yet to know about) like he's conducting some strange class for aspiring attorneys. He makes it clear his preferences do not include computers, which sets up the entire 'man vs. machine' theme during the court scenes (we'll revisit this theme in later episodes, such as ""The Ultimate Computer""). Who is this seeming nutcase, we might ask, and just what is he blathering on about? Kirk seems to be in real trouble now - his lawyer's a couple of cans short of a six-pack. But, by the 4th act, we realize Cogley is one of the reasons we were able to set up a Federation. He represents not only humanity, but civilization - that striving for decency by half-savages, manifested by written laws passed down through the ages - laws which govern - laws which make possible such civilized trials to protect the innocent, resulting in a thorough quest for the truth.",7
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Court Martial (TV Episode 1967)",The acting saves this one,"What should have been one of the worst first season episodes is salvaged by solid performances by William Shatner and guest stars Percy Rodriguez and Elisha Cook Jr, good editing and directing. Cook is especially charming as the defense attorney representing Kirk in a court martial concerning the death of a Lieutenant Commander who shares a rocky history with our captain, and Shatner's acting is spot-on for this difficult episode. Daniels' directing is also fairly good, but hampered by the limitations of the plot.The initial premise is promising. Kirk is charged with negligence in the death of a Lt Comm Finney, whose career has been overshadowed consistently by Kirk's. Kirk repeatedly claims that he jettisoned Finney's pod after declaring a red alert and telling Finney to get to safety, but the ship's video record and computer logs tell a very different story. (Incidentally, one of the most ridiculous use of props I have ever seen in ST occurs in the crucial courtroom scene involving the video logs - take a close look at the control panel Kirk uses to jettison the pod. How many pods does the Enterprise jettison in a given day, and why does the Captain do this himself from a control panel on his arm rest???).Unfortunately, just as the full story is revealed, the episode devolves into a poorly considered, rather cliché conclusion - which I will not discuss in order to avoid a spoiler.",6

The Enterprise encountered an ion storm that left the ship damaged and crew member Finney dead. They headed for Star Base 11 for some repairs and Kirk filed the report of Finney's death. Portmaster Stone wanted to see the ship's log and Spock brought it to him so Stone could verify what happened and why Kirk ordered the Enterprise to jettison out of there. The computer log showed that Kirk fled out of there too soon and that Kirk is responsible for the death of Finney. Kirk claims that is not what happened and explains it to Stone but Stone called for a court hearing to court-martial Kirk based on the ship's log. Spock is using his logic to figure out what happened to the computer while Kirk's lawyer is trying hard to prove Kirk's innocence to the court. The answer to what really happened lies in the question ""what happened to Finney?"".An interesting episode that shows how video and even computers can be easily manipulated to make the guilty look innocent and the innocent look guilty. Logical but quick thinking is needed in cases like these.7.5/10",7
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Court Martial (TV Episode 1967)",Kirk on trial,"When a crew member is killed in an accident Captain Kirk claims that he had to jettison the pod containing Lt. Commander Finney to save the ship shortly after going to red alert during an ion storm the problem is computer evidence suggests he jettisoned the pod prior to going to red alert. It doesn't help that it is known that Finney blames Kirk for his inability to get a ship of his own as Kirk reported one of his mistakes years before and it is speculated that this animosity is mutual and the prosecuting attorney is one of Kirk's former girlfriends. As the trial progresses all the witnesses say that there is no way Kirk would panic or let personal feelings affect his judgement yet computer evidence including video recordings suggest otherwise. If Kirk is to avoid a guilty verdict Spock will have to show that the 'infallible' computer was wrong.There is little action in this episode; we don't even see the events that lead to Kirk's court martial until the computer evidence is played during the trial while this might make it a 'cheap episode' it doesn't mean it isn't entertaining. The highlight of the episode is Elisha Cook Jr's performance as Samuel T. Cogley, Kirk's defence attorney; a delightfully old fashioned character who one would imagine would feel more at home in a western than on a spaceship! The ending featured a good if somewhat melodramatic twist that I hadn't seen coming. The episode isn't without flaws; it is hard to believe that Kirk's ex-girlfriend would be leading the prosecution and the possibility that somebody could have tampered with the computer isn't raised till surprisingly late in the story these aren't enough to spoil the episode. Overall a decent enough episode but far from a classic.",7
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Court Martial (TV Episode 1967)",Kirk Gets Tried by Ex Girlfriend,"OK, so in the future, a prosecutor doesn't have to recuse herself when she was romantically involved with the defendant? O-K. Maybe it added to the drama, but come on! Kirk stands accused of jettisoning his former friend and academy instructor, current Enterprise Records Officer Lt. Commander Ben Finney, during an ion storm, either out of panic or malicious intent (neither of which are in Kirk's character), before going to red alert instead of after, as is required. The problem is that the computer log says he's guilty, and as we're told over and over again in the episode, computer's DON'T lie (more on this later).It's apparent in this episode and a couple of others that Kirk wasn't liked by all of his fellow officers; that a lot of people who Kirk knew on his way up the promotion ladder were happy to see our cocky young starship captain, who may well have helped his career at the expense of the aforementioned Finney, get his comeuppance, and were ready to believe the worst about him, even though it turned out to be false (you get the idea that Commodore Stone was one such person..ditto Commodore Wesley in the Ultimate Computer the following season). It would have been nice to explore that angle of the story a bit more, but there's only 50 minutes or so of TV time. That said, it's hard to sympathize with the ill-fated Finney getting passed over by Kirk to command a starship given his ultimate breakdown (would you want this guy commanding the SS Minnow, much less the Enterprise?).This is a good episode in that you see Kirk's character come through. In spite of what the computer said (remember, computers DON'T lie), Kirk knew damn good and well what he did and was ready to go down fighting, regardless of the result. Of course, this is Star trek so obviously there has to be a loophole: Computers CAN lie..if someone with enough computer savvy to alter a computer log tells them to. Spock figures this out late in the episode (naturally) by playing chess with the computer. Props to the great character actor Elisha Cook for his portrayal of the idealistic and book-crazy (never uses his computer) defense lawyer Samuel T. Cogley. And Joan Marshall...what a hottie (just like all of Kirk's ""old friends"", as McCoy points out in this episode). One definite negative: One of the more lame props in the series, the ""white sound"" device used to mask people's heart beats, which is obviously a mid 20th century microphone. In fact, the scene where McCoy is using it takes way too long.",8
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Court Martial (TV Episode 1967)",The one with the set-up,"Generally, Star Trek is good at drawing parallels between science-fiction and the real world. This time, however, the use of a very real situation such as a court martial to provide a little suspense doesn't really work out.The court martial is set up by Starfleet (mentioned for the first time here) to find out if Kirk behaved improperly during a crisis. He claims he did everything by the book, but the Enterprise's computer records - unquestionable evidence by everyone's standards - seem to indicate the death of a crewman (an old friend of Kirk's, no less) was the result of the captain's negligence. Lucky for him, his lawyer doesn't trust computers, and sets out to prove something went wrong, while Spock does the same on the ship.The outcome is pretty predictable, which is why Court Martial doesn't impress as much as previous episodes. Okay, so it's a given Kirk will never get in any serious trouble, but this time the story suffers from a clear lack of proper drama and a couple of unnecessary clichés (the prosecutor is one of Kirk's ex-girlfriends). Nevertheless, the story's examination of the man vs. machine theme is still relevant, and despite the sub-par twists, Shatner and Nimoy are always a riot.",7
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Court Martial (TV Episode 1967)","Partially Re-told in Next Generation ""The Measure of a Man""","One of the things I love the most is Courtroom Drama, and when mixed with Science Fiction, it becomes a feast.What happens here, as Kirk is accused of negligence in the death of a crewman, a friend... is that he is prosecuted by one of his girlfriends. But she provides him a defender, in the shape of Samuel T. Cogley played by the great Elisha Cook of The Maltese Falcon.A similar thing happens to Jean-Luc Picard in the Next Generation episode ""The Measure of a Man"" - He is prosecuted vehemently in front of one of his ex girlfriends, who had prosecuted HIM when he lost his original ship, the Stargazer.In this Original Series Courtroom, Cogley defends Kirk much like Perry Mason would have, with that little smile on his face.It is only when Spock discovers that his Three-Dimensional Chess he had programmed into the Enterprise Computer has been Futzed with, that it also explains why the ships computer would record an event incorrectly.This brings up new cogitations in Cogley's Brain, so he creates a Theatrical Fishing Expedition and Court Venue move to the Enterprise Bridge - To Prove his Cogitations. and these pan out.The only thing I find pretty funny in this episode, in the one Kirk- Fight scene, is the use of fighting doubles who have no resemblance to Shatner and the guy he is fighting. On Low-Resolution CRT Televisions, this could not be seen - But it CAN, in the remastered Enhanced Edition.Court Drama can be intriguing, if done right. It is done right in this episode. The Menagerie does not count, as it is actually the ""Fiction"" of a court martial, but here, this is a real case and Kirks career is on the line. It's a De-Facto mystery. My only issue is with the denouement, where Kirk kicks poor Finney's Arse. I mean, the poor slob, it was not a malice issue, but a madness issue.The Enhanced Edition, which in this case, actually does Justice to the exterior shots. I am finding out, not all of these TOS episodes in the Enhanced Edition have been as Hamhandedly ""reimagined"" in the same terrible way that ""Where No Man has Gone Before"" has been.

The way things are there's no way you can beat a computer at anything. But that depends on who's programming the machine and it is only a machine.With a little help from Leonard Nimoy that most computer like of living beings, Cook proves you can rig things even the Star Trek computer logs. You know that because Captain Kirk does return to command the Enterprise in the next episode.Captain Kirk is charged that in his negligence he causes the death of Lt.Commander Richard Webb while going through an ion storm.

About the only highlight in the show is the guest appearance of character actor, Elisha Cook. He was a fine actor and added a nice performance to the show.

They obviously have had some romantic involvement in the past. To Kirk's surprise, he finds out that she will be prosecuting him. Elisha Cook is an unconventional but highly respected attorney who will be defending the Captain. The trial proceeds, Jamie in attendance. All the evidence, including a video of the bridge at the time, proves the Prosecution's case. Kirk is toast until Spock sits down to play a game of 3-Dimensional Chess (I never quite figured out that game).

Can Kirk prove that events didn't go as the computer claims they did?I was never a big fan of Star Trek attempting to adapt itself into a courtroom drama. And while I enjoy the themes of this episode (technology's infallibility, trusting a computer's judgment over a human's, data manipulation to get what you want), I couldn't help but feel a bit bored during this one. I enjoyed the small roles in this episode. Rodrigues, Cook Jr., and Marshall all give memorable performances in their respective roles. Some of this plot leaves me with some questions though.So why does Finney suddenly decide to frame Kirk? Has this been being planned for a while or did some recent event trigger this? And I find it extremely odd that Shaw isn't required to recuse herself from the trial due to her romantic history with Kirk. That seems like an extreme conflict of interest. I also have problems that the jettison button is right next to the red alert button. From the video, it looks as if he could accidentally bump it with an elbow and accidentally kill someone.

He fakes his own murder and secrets himself away in a small chamber he had built in his house until the heat had died down. In Conan-Doyle's tale however a charred body, that of a tramp (hobo) dressed in the builders old clothes is used to incriminate the victim.In both case guilt by the victim is hard to refute but as ever total logical thought by the two hero's, Holmes and latterly Spock saved the day.Using heartbeats to trace the hidden perpetrator was a bit contrived given the sensors on the Enterprise - Holmes burned wet straw to smoke the bad guy out.Its always intriguing watching the technology in Star Trek.

The introduction of Kirk's lawyer is--again--excellent, and seems to promise something great to come.However, the premise of the case is a bit absurd. The career of a starship captain hanging on an event that could so easily be faked by TODAY'S standards hardly seems a plausible cause for a trial in the 23rd century. I suppose this courtroom has never seen a film before, or they'd understand how easy it is to manipulate a close-up (for our sake, a wide shot with Kirk hitting the button would have been more convincing).Also, is there any 20th century device LESS conspicuous that a MICROPHONE.

Still it was fun to see the dress uniforms for court!The eccentric lawyer with hundreds of books was also interesting. Why the old books? We know that by this point in history, such information would surely be digitized. The relationship with the old girlfriend, now Kirk's prosecuting attorney, was a lot of nonsense, and of course that would never be allowed. The scene of him kissing her at the end on the bridge was just ridiculous. It appears that William Shatner has a kissing clause in his contract, it's required in every episode. The ""moral of the story"" is the contrast between the noble James T Kirk, who rises above everything, and the contemptible Benjamin Finney, who blames others for his weaknesses.The greater ""Star Trek message"" here is that if you are ever in trouble, whether innocent or guilty, take it like a man.True enough.",7

The computer on board the Enterprise says different, it seems. Recorded evidence says Kirk ejected the pod during yellow alert, with the trial looking grave for him. Percy Rodrigues is Commodore Stone, the authority at the starbase where the Enterprise is located during repairs. His willingness to not prosecute Kirk if he'll just accept exhaustion and panic as reasoning for the mistake produces a heated exchange indeed. Joan Marshall (Castle's Homicidal) is Kirk's former love and assigned to prosecute him! Why wouldn't she recuse herself? For dramatic purposes it serves its place in the plot. Spock and the computer's game of chess, the supposedly dead lieutenant's heartbeat, and Jame's change of heart when she reads from her father's journal could indicate Kirk has been the victim of revenge and machine tinkering. While there is no doubt Kirk will find his way out of yet another predicament, the pitiable Richard Webb totally gonzo, having rigged circuits so that the Enterprise would enter decaying orbit, leaves some excitement in the end, although it is clear there was post production snipping. Fun to see Cook as Kirk's defender, all books and more than a bit anti- computer.

I don't buy that at all.
Also it isn't really clear why Starfleet is adamant to ruin him completely after he wants to go to trail, when they were willing to sweep it under the rug before.
The execution is good though, so after the initial weakness the court scenes and his interaction with his laywer are well done and the episode never gets boring. The Kirk saves the day action ending seems tacked on, but also par for the course in TOS.

When you stop and think about it, the quantum leap in set design and special effects over the past four decades are really quite stunning.I'm not so sure I'm buying Finney's (Richard Webb) ability to hide out on the Enterprise though, once the pod was ejected. Or why he would even need to. The ship was at Starbase 11 for repairs, so why hang around? Had he high-tailed it the first chance he got, he would have attained his goal of revenge on Kirk, and the next episode might have had a Captain Spock in charge.",7
22,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Court Martial (TV Episode 1967)","Decent episode, but outdated and some silly elements","I thought this was a decent, if unexceptional episode. The legal drama was a little dragged out and the outcome is somewhat obvious; the only possible explanation is that the computer was tampered with. This was probably my major complaint with the episode; this seems so obvious today, but perhaps a less sophisticated audience in 1967 really did believe in the infallibility of computers (or at least was more susceptible to such a belief); but it just seems hopelessly naive, now.The legalistic aspects were not handled badly for a TV series, although I thought Kirk's attorney's big dramatic speech was a bit silly. There was a much better logical argument: shouldn't there have been more time allotted to the defense, to thoroughly check the computer for tampering? And shouldn't examining the computers have been the focus of the trial from the outset? But I guess the 'big speech' played out better dramatically, so its use was understandable here.Finney's scheme was kind of crazy-- it critically depended on never being discovered by Starfleet, thereby burning his bridges permanently-- but he was indeed portrayed toward the end as having totally lost it, so at least that part was internally consistent.The other technological part that was probably good for its time, but seems quite silly now, was the use of the heartbeats of the crew to locate Finney. Surely they could have detected him more directly with the ship's sensors? There was also a minor contradiction with the Menagerie episode; in that episode, it was stated that detailed video records of all ship activity simply aren't routinely made; but that's a minor quibble.Some minor trivia: This episode confirms that Spock's rank in the first season was lieutenant commander (this was also mentioned in several earlier episodes, but seems fairly definitely established here), as was Dr. McCoy's.",6

The planet has 1 ruler/leader, who's name is Landru. But he is really just a computer. This was a common theme in the original Star Trek...computers gone awry. In the episode all citizens must become ""of the body"". If they aren't ""of the body"", they are pointed out, or busted by those of the body. Once ""assimilated"", all citizens feel joy, peace and contentment.

1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Return of the Archons (TV Episode 1967)","Self-defense, conflicting Prime Directives and how to outsmart an omnipotent power","Return of the Archons is one of those episodes of TOS which, whether you like it or not, sticks with you. It is one of the franchises first attempts to deal with dystopian subjects and takes place almost entirely on a planet inhabited by people whose lives are regulated in all respects by the mysterious force known as Landru. Sulu sets this up by becoming the first member of the crew to become absorbed by 'the body'. He is transported back to the ship in the same state of idiotic bliss as the inhabitants of the planet, and begins babbling the praises of Landru. Takei's acting makes this opening scene very memorable and sets a disturbing tone.The Archons were crew members of the USS Archon, a federation ship which arrived at this planet long ago. Today, the Archons live only as a legend of resistance to Landru and 'The Body' - his regulated, brain-washed society. The story is well written and smartly conceived. Within the first 20 minutes, the episode gives us a taste of the body's folk-lore, language, and regulatory systems.This episode incorporates some comic elements early on - mostly the typical human vs vulcan theme - but the humor dies down as the bridge crew begins to understand the threat they are facing. Landru sees all, is beginning to absorb all, and is pulling the ship out of its orbit. Kirk, Spock and a small landing party must violate the prime directive to save their ship and the catatonic society they have encountered. But they frankly don't even know where to start.",7
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Return of the Archons (TV Episode 1967)",Better Hurry - it's almost The Red Hour,"Some rather deep and sophisticated concepts were presented in this episode, quite sophisticated even for this show; the drawback was an unexciting narrative, even a drab pace. The Enterprise had already arrived at a planet before the episode begins, on one of those investigative searches for a lost Federation ship from a century prior. The planet's inhabitants all seem to be in a perpetual state of vapid, almost mindless contentment, walking about in a happy daze on the streets of a pleasant town. Well, perpetual until the big clock strikes a certain hour - then everyone goes crazy raping & pillaging (I wonder who cleans up these messes afterward?). The people here are no more than wind up toys, following the telepathic command of a hidden ruler named Landru. It's one of those 'group-mind' premises prevalent in sf, especially in the sixties. There are no real individuals left, only a 'body' composed of many cells, each pretty much the same as the next one. This proposes that when free will becomes too intoxicating and mankind nearly destroys itself (i.e. self-induced holocaust), then something may step in to regulate our will to avoid extinction - a cosmic Gandhi turned benign dictator, if you will.However, as with every body, there appear certain strains or viruses attacking from within. The rebels here work in groups of 3 and are apparently resistant to the absorption techniques imposed by Landru. It's interesting that these rebels are all old men, perhaps having developed some immunity over time, but they're not so much into rebelling as crying for some saviors to come - like the 'Archons' from a 100 years ago. Kirk has to coerce these guys into helping him find this mysterious Landru, while avoiding being absorbed. My favorite scene lets actor Kelley show what a good actor he really was after McCoy gets absorbed into the body. No one else was able to capture that self-satisfied contentment as well as he did and it was all the more unsettling when, after pointing an accusatory finger, he attacked Kirk in rage (""You're NOT of the BODY!"") - I tell you, you can't pay for better entertainment sometimes. The 4th act, unfortunately, is anti-climactic, with a pat use of anti-machine logic by Kirk to get some circuits sputtering (see later episodes such as ""The Ultimate Computer"" and ""The Changeling""). I did appreciate the guest turn by actor Thatcher who appears late in the episode - I'll always remember him from the best Sinbad movie.Now we come to the real crux of this story - the complete disregard of the Prime Directive, that supposedly unyielding law which governs the ethics of the Federation. It states that such Federation envoys as the Enterprise crew may never interfere with or change another culture. Well, maybe it wasn't a COMPLETE disregard: Spock does remind Kirk of the directive towards the 4th act. Kirk dismisses this law with a couple of sentences, that it only refers to a growing culture, which this isn't. Oh, really? Perhaps now we understand the attraction of going off into space as a starship captain - you get to play God on occasion. Not a bad way to spend one's time - as Kirk would do again; remember ""The Apple"" and, very soon, ""A Taste of Armageddon""?",7
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Return of the Archons (TV Episode 1967)","""Your individuality will merge into the unity of the Good"".","Back when I was watching these Star Trek episodes as reruns in the Seventies, I would never have considered the political and societal implications of an episode like 'The Return of the Archons'. For anyone watching these shows as a youth, the stories seem primed purely for entertainment. The same could be said for an earlier series, my all time favorite, The Twilight Zone. Yet in many of his stories, Rod Serling took a definite stand against the encroaching authority of the state, and both subtle and not so subtle intrusions against individual freedom and liberty. Perhaps his strongest statement in that regard was the TZ second season episode 'The Obsolete Man', and to a lesser extent, 'Eye of the Beholder', even though that latter one is generally remembered for representing something entirely different.I have no idea what Gene Roddenberry's political leanings might have been, but one gets a strong hint with 'The Archons'. The summary line quoted above, when studied for it's deeper subtext, contains the ultimate promise of the uber-Socialist. One's freedom and individuality, as demonstrated by the spirit of Landru, is a machine's concept of perfection, one of peace and harmony, but sadly no soul. Although the conundrum presented by Captain Kirk to the machine logic of Landru is a bit awkward, it isn't hard to demonstrate that lacking a freedom of choice, there is no creativity, and ultimately, no life. At least no life that can express joy at it's own existence, only those distractions brought on by a manufactured 'Red Hour', or as I came to the conclusion while watching, a Mardi Gras on steroids.There's also Roddenberry's intriguing symbolism of 'the three', those elder statesmen if you will, who were immune to 'absorption'. The idea I take away here is that only the oldest residents of Beta III were able to remember the way things used to be prior to the arrival of the first starship, the Archons, a hundred years earlier. In that context, Reger (Harry Townes), Hacom (Morgan Farley) and Marplon (Torin Thatcher) were the last line of defense before The Enterprise arrived to keep alive the traditions of the past. They were among the last remaining citizens who understood that 'freedom is never a gift'.I could probably go on and on with this subject, the seed of a college thesis is at the core of this story. However I'd like to wrap up with another reference to Rod Serling and his own unique vision. There was a fourth season TZ episode entitled 'The New Exhibit'. In that one, a museum caretaker brings home a murderers row of wax dummies representing infamous killers in history. Near the end of the story he admonishes one of his figures for killing a guest who came to his home. The name of the murderer using a garrote - it was Landru!",9
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Return of the Archons (TV Episode 1967)",Quite a mix of sophisticated thinking and comic book resolution,"This is a rather strange episode of Star Trek. It could have possibly been a great one. Someone above mentions how the Red Hour aspect of the story is never explained. I suspect that this is because something was either left out or cut out of the final script. It is a very interesting idea, that the content, happy folks of this society must periodically have ""Festival"" which... Blows off steam? Keeps the pressure cooker from boiling over with joy? I suspect it was something like this, something explained in the original script and a very interesting and deep concept for the show.Another thing not explained (or perhaps I missed this) is the ""hollow tube"" weapon. When it is discovered that this weapon is just that, a hollow tube with no mechanical parts, it appears this is another little detail that was left out of the final script--why and what then caused it to kill and control? Another tantalizing plot device, like the Red Hour, that could have, if given the time (i.e., longer than 60 minutes), made for a very exciting and well-thought out episode. Unfortunately, the ending is one of those human versus computer things where, of course, Kirk wins out while reasoning with the evil computer, causing it to destroy itself. A common and really ridiculous plot device that was perhaps changed in the final script also.In all, not a bad ST episode but it could have been much better.",6
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Return of the Archons (TV Episode 1967)",Curious episode that works in odd way,"Return of the Archons is one of the Star Trek episodes I didn't much care for years ago, but has grown on me.The characters and themes seem close to the edge of outright silliness at times, but somehow, it works. The sense of a genuinely strange society, that the Enterprise crew have stumbled onto, is conveyed well. Seeing Captain Kirk dressed as if he were on his way to the gunfight at the OK Corral is odd enough to be memorable, along with the medieval dungeon they find themselves in, the hooded robes and staffs of the Lawgivers, and the obscure lingo about the Body, etc.It's certainly imaginative and creatively done for a low budget TV show. Charles Macaulay, as the mysterious, seemingly benevolent Landru has such a marvelous voice and presence that I wish his character could have had more screen time.One of the most oddly memorable scenes is that that of their host Reger showing the landing party to their quarters, and the following scene of them waking the next day, with Kirk sleeping standing up in a blanket, and Spock lying on his back in a bunk bed. The incongruity of the solemn Spock sleeping in a bunk bed is an image that tends to stay with me.",7
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Return of the Archons (TV Episode 1967)",The will of Landru,"One of my favorite of the Star Trek prime episodes is this one. A great lesson to be learned when humankind thinks it has found the perfect society and seeks nothing else.This story has Lieutenant Sulu getting beamed back aboard the Enterprise in a rather dreamy like state like he was a member of some cult. When a larger away team led by William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy go down they find a society frozen in time and completely submerged in a philosophy of peace and non-violence. Except of course for the 'festival' when ones baser impulses get to run amuck.The people on Beta III as this planet is known to Star Fleet are held in thrall by the will of an ancient philosopher named Landru. And before Landru died he found a way to see his teachings were carried out. What it involved was nothing less than the stamping out of individuality.Back when I saw this episode in its first run I was taking Far Eastern history in college and we learned about Confucius and his influence on Chinese culture. He did not speak in fortune cookie aphorisms as those old Charlie Chan films would have you believe. But he did have a lot of wise things to say and we in the west could profit by some of it. So great was his influence that it guided the culture. And so great was the respect he was held in that it was thought in that society all wisdom began and ended with him. I don't think Confucius himself ever thought so and he certainly did not have the advance technology that Landru had and built 6000 years earlier for his planet.Only with individuality comes new ideas, bad and good and over time we find out what the good is. A great lesson taught to us by Gene Roddenberry, courtesy of Star Trek.",8

And the idea that this Landrew character is sort of like ""Big Brother"" and watches and controls everything is also pretty exciting. However, the execution of the episode isn't all that great--particularly the whole ""red hour"" segment. At the red hour, every one of the very peaceful and placid people of the planet become raving maniacs and run amok--this NEVER was explained and didn't fit into the plot at all. I really think they added it because someone thought the episode was dull and thought ""let's add a cleaned-up version of an orgy to keep the viewers awake"". Well, it just irritated me. And, overall, the episode was very watchable but far from memorable. The show just needed more fun and energy.",7
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Return of the Archons (TV Episode 1967)",Sulu and Bones get brainwashed will Kirk and Spock be next?,"In the opening scene Sulu and another crewmember are investigating the mystery of the Archon, a ship that disappeared a century ago, in a town that is reminiscent of the late nineteenth century but there is something odd about the people; they act more like automata than human beings. The two officers are cornered by robed men and Sulu is touched by their staffs just as he beams out; back on the Enterprise he starts to behave like the inhabitants of the planet. To find out what happened Kirk leads a full away mission to the planet and discover a strange society were almost everybody has been absorbed into 'The Body' by a leader known as Landru and those who for whatever reason haven't been absorbed are in danger of being killed in the interest of 'the greater good'. If Kirk and his team are to avoid being absorbed they will have to discover the truth behind Landru.This is a fine episode takes us into a rather disturbing society; outwardly it looks almost Utopian but it quickly emerges that the minority who haven't been absorbed live in fear of being discovered by those who have; the latter behaving like brainwashed religious zealots. The society's uniformity isn't totally boring though; every so often they have 'Festival' when they are released from control and run wild. There is a greater than usual sense of threat as the opening shows a major character being effected rather than just killing of some red-shirt we have never seen before and Sulu is only the first to be effected. The ultimate discovery about the true nature and defeat of Landru are a little disappointing now but I suspect it would have seemed better when this first aired in 1967. Overall a good episode set on an interesting world.",8

THE RETURN OF THE ARCHONS holds up as a fairly bold examination of the absolute mindlessness of The True Believer(s), of the willingness to bend oneself to the will of someone (or someTHING) beyond one's ken (a view even more valid Today than it was in 1967!). The eerie, dreamlike state of the True Believers, underscored by some of the creepiest music ever done for the show, speaks (volumes) for itself. There's not a bad performance to be found, and Charles Macauley (who played the greatest Dracula of them all in BLACULA) is spot-on as the enigmatic Landru- and DeForest Kelly is great as a McCoy who has gotten religion.",10

And I hope, it broke some noses in the process.Extremism is not limited to any particular religion, it can infect any of the worlds great religions. And much like The ""Chronicles of Riddick"" - If an extremist cannot convert you, they will probably try to kill you.The idea that the absolute truth is only available to those who believe in one particular religion, is folly and fallacy, and maybe apostasy. And just like the planet Beta III in this episode, we see what happens to a society when all creative incentive is forbidden to the membership and only allowed to the leadership - The society which is based on the religion becomes stagnant.This difficult-to-watch Star Trek Original Series episode shows how such a society will look, the membership, while outwardly proclaiming peace and Joy, have neither. They are tightly controlled, and Law is upheld by Fear Alone.Taken one step further, the leadership of this stagnation is a machine! And so we have here the very first Computer-Confounding of James T Kirk's career. He becomes an expert in the destruction of computers using illogic, up to and including V'Ger. So maybe this is not as funny as they way he did it in ""I, Mudd"" - But the process he uses is very much the same.On a Side-Note, Jon Lormer, who plays the Illusion ""Dr Haskins"" in ""The Cage/The Menagerie"" is ""Tamar"" - The First casualty of this episode at the hands of ""Landru"" (Charles Macaulay).",10
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Return of the Archons (TV Episode 1967)",One of the worst episodes,"Gah, this was a terrible episode. Like the earlier episode, ""The Enemy Within"", this played out like a bad Twilight Zone episode. For the record, I liked ""Twilight Zone"" as a series overall, but there was an astonishing mix of good and bad episodes in that series, with some major ""gimmick"" episodes that relied critically on one 'big twist'. That worked out a bit better for an anthology series like TZ that was in a half-hour time slot; but much less so for a 'serious' show like Star Trek, where the 50 minutes just drag on painfully.The premise is that the crew find themselves trapped on a peculiar world where some unseen master (""Landru"", who turns out to be a computer) forces everyone to act ""happy"" and not ask questions. Kirk and company's mission is to figure out how to disable the mysterious master, free the natives, and escape.The main theme is incredibly simplistic: a computer lacks ""soul"", so it would make a poor ruler. Well, yeah, obviously, if one is talking about a 'computer' in the conventional sense; but this assumes that a true AI is not possible, which may or may not be the case.This episode had some really strange elements. Whereas most of the time the people act zombie-like and complacent, there is the strange periodic ""Festival"" where everyone runs around berserk, seemingly engaging in wanton sex and violence (the sex of course was only suggested)- what the heck was that about? Was it just to procreate the species? The odd implication is that such excesses are a 'natural' part of humans which need to be indulged in every so often, which I don't really buy.Basically, one can just watch the first few minutes, then fast forward to the end, to get the gist of the episode, without having to endure the painfully boring bulk of it. That's all I plan to do if I ever feel compelled to review this episode again for the sake of completeness. The entire middle part is mostly superfluous nonsense.(MAJOR SPOILER FOLLOWS)Even the ending was incredibly cheesy, hardly worth watching. Kirk basically just ""outwits"" the computer and ""talks it into"" destroying itself. Talk about lousy programming (of the computer) and weak writing (of the script).",2
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Return of the Archons (TV Episode 1967)",Ladru knows this is my Favorite Star Trek episode.,"One of my great joys as a child of the sixties was to watch Star Trek on Friday nights at Mark Strauss' Baldwin Harbor Home on their RCA color Television set. The ""STANDARD"" precept for the Star Trek show is ""The Prime Directive"". This is the guiding principle of the United Federation Of Planets which prohibits Starfleet personnel from interfering with the internal development of alien civilizations. This particularly applies to alien worlds which are below the threshold of technological scientific and cultural development. The Star Ship ""Enterprise"" travels to Beta III in hopes of learning the fate of the missing Archon ship 100 years earlier that landed there with their crew. Crew members of the Starship Enterprise, Sulu (George Takai) and O'Neil (Sean Morgan) were sent, beamed down to the planet for reconnaissance to find information, answers about the Archon crew. Sulu returned aboard the ""Enterprise"" in some what of a trance to the crew's disbelief. The Captain James T. Kirk decides to send down a second landing party including himself to find out what happened to Crewman O'Neil. Upon their arrival wearing local garb the planet resembles an old 19th century western town. The crew of the enterprise is startled as the locals walk slowly as if they were floating by. One of the locals Bilar approached the crew and says, ""Joy to you friends."" Captain Kirk obliges by repeating, ""Joy To You."" Bilar adds..."" You be strangers? Come for festival are ya? Got a place to sleep it off yet? Go around to Reger's house. He's got rooms, but you'll have to hurry it's almost red hour."" The confused crew couldn't comprehend those bizarre statements. Then the huge clock in the town square strikes six and the Zombie like residents turn into wild savages starting fires, screaming and throwing rocks through store front windows as the startled crew heads for the aforementioned hotel of Reger. As they head inside the establishment for safety there stands Reger's accompanied by Tula (Brioni Farrell) and an agitated Tamar Jon Lormer who is questioning the loyalty of these new visitors. Reger and Tula are the exceptions in this world of order. Reger asks if they are from the Valley or are they Archons. Kirk replies, ""What if we are?"" Meanwhile an aggravated Crewman Lindstrom (Carl Held) complains to Reger as his Daughter was caught in the fracas of the Red hour. Reger replies by saying ""It's the will of Landru."" Tamar was skeptical and realized the crew is not of the body. A perturbed Tamar runs out of the lobby into the street and summons two men in hooded robes and long tubes. They enter but Tula in defense gets zapped by the henchman. Falls to the floor and Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelly) says, ""He's dead."" An image appears and it's a man in a robe from a time past. It's Landru played by Charles Macaulay who tells the startled crew that they are invading the body and must be absorbed and if they refuse they will be obliterated. Landru did not personally respond because Spock (Leonard Nimoy) tells the Captain (William Shatner) that it's only a projection. Meanwhile up in orbit Scotty, (James Doohan) the ships engineer, tells the Captain that there's a tractor beam hitting the ship and pulling the Enterprise slowly into Beta III atmosphere. Back on the planet the crew fights the henchman and escape the tubes and now head for safety elsewhere provide by Reger but the locals under the direction of Landru Grab wood, clubs and Stones as they attack the crew . Luckily armed with Phazers they use the wide field beam on stun and knock out the attackers. The crew heads for cover in another building free from Landru until they notice crewman O'Neil among the attackers . Rendered unconscious by the phazer, the crew takes him along against Reger's wishes. Reger explains that you can't take him because he was already absorbed Landru will use him as tracking devise and find us. Doctor McCoy give comatose crewman a sedative as Reger explains the world they entered is controlled by Landru for 6000 years. Linstrom complains,""This is simply ridiculous, A bunch of stone aged characters running around in robes?"" and Spock replies,""And apparently commanding powers far beyond our comprehension. Not simple,not ridiculous. Very very dangerous."" As usual the crew of the Enterprise is in a very dicey situation with Landru and the ship drifting into the planet. I particularly liked this story. Some classic quotes come to mind, for example when Spock and the Captain Kirk are fighting the robes and Spock instead of using his famous Vulcan neck pinch. He give a right cross to the jaw of the recipient. Kirk looks over in amazement and says ""Isn't that a bit old fashioned?"" The teleplay by Gene Roddenberry and written by Boris Sobelman cleverly transcribing the man against computer genre. One of four instances throughout the Star Trek series. The final confrontation with Captain Kirk and First Officer Spock against the machine is sheer genius. Defining what a living growing culture consists of. Baffling the mighty computer/ Landru and how to disable the machine with out weapons or punches thrown and applying the Prime Directive. I personally enjoyed the epilogue as Spock blushes as the Captain tells him that he would have made an excellent computer. Conversely you see helmsman Sulu return to normal and back at the helm. Warp factor ONE! Time to say ""Good Night"" to the Strauss Family head back to Elmont and my ugly black and white television.",7
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Return of the Archons (TV Episode 1967)",Social repression and trends,"Like the other reviewer said, the Red Hour is nigh. The author of the episode shows the audience a skewed view of societal controls through repression and the extraction of the human soul by allowing ceremony and ritual, however harmful, to establish an unhealthy norm.Without elaborating on specifics, and in this way revealing possible spoilers, I'll say that Kirk once again uses his guile and wits to baffle yet another integrated circuit board cranium.Here again we witness some innovation by the production crew to use period costume to revive and re-energize the sense of an alien world. The viewer is given some tangibility with the props and sets, but the theme and more ""alien"" aspects of this episode are presented when the deeper impetus of the story is revealed.A commentary on everything from drunken rioting at sporting events to other like group behavior that people think justified because ""everyone else is doing it"". Yet another bit of profundity from the creative minds at Desilu Studios.Enjoy.",
14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Return of the Archons (TV Episode 1967)",Classic Trek Episode With Deep Roots In American Literature,"So many fantastic reviews for this episode, but with all the talk about computers and the science fiction themes it's interesting that no one has commented on the moody and atmospheric way it draws on classic American literature.Think of Shirley Jackson's story ""The Lottery"" the next time you watch this episode. Notice the sharp contrast between the outwardly virtuous small town life and the mindless violence the people throw themselves into with wild abandon whenever the Red Hour comes around. Think of Hawthorne's THE SCARLET LETTER. (Or even his short stories ""Young Goodman Brown"" and ""The Minister's Black Veil."") The townspeople are all suspicious of outsiders, and pretend to fear their immoral ways, yet beneath the bland facade (like the black veil of the minister) they're all concealing some really unspeakable goings on.I first saw this episode as a little kid, and what really struck me was not the computer stuff at the end but the haunting atmosphere at the beginning -- the New England accents, the string ties, the brutal violence under the fatuous hospitality. This is a very American episode of Star Trek, with roots that go all the way back to Plymouth Rock!",8
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Return of the Archons (TV Episode 1967)","If I were you, I'd look for another job, Roddenberry","Roddenberry strikes again, somehow the person we have to thank for this entire franchise manages time after time to riddle his inputs to the show with American Propaganda Nonsense and 'Return of the Archons' is amongst the biggest of such examples.So let me get what I enjoyed about the episode out of the way. Firstly I appreciated the main cast's performances, specifically from Kelley who actually manages to make these zombie hippie-commies seem interesting. Indeed one of the episode's few redeeming scenes comes mid-way when McCoy is left to sit in the background like an oblivious child until he suspects Kirk and Spock's whispering. I also thought Roddenberry's dialogue was good enough throughout, it's just a shame that they are constantly blabbering on about how a different society is unacceptable.So naturally now I'm going to go on about what I disliked about 'Return of the Archons'. Firstly the whole 'festival' thing, although a very feasible concept, I felt was very poorly produced. The end result ends up coming off as completely absurd, wacky and unconvincing. It's dramatic and pleasing to watch just for the sheer insanity of it all, but when you take it in context of how seriously the script seems to take itself, you have to realise how poor it is implemented here. Half way through the episode however I found myself craving some more of this anarchy in place of the extremely dull and repetitive plot which moves along frustratingly slowly, heading for a conclusion that doesn't pay off at all.The final scenes involving Kirk defeating and outsmarting the computer lacks conviction, focus and is simply unconvincing. Never does Kirk or Spock justify how lack of creativity destroys the 'body'. In fact I could come up with a thousand reasons as to justify the exact opposite. Don't you think if creativity was necessary to keeping the 'body' alive that Landrau would have programmed such rules for the computer to enforce? Essentially the whole episode boils down to a message that any society different from that of 1960's America is unacceptable- how could anything be better than the great Democracy? Specifically however, this is a blatant attack on Communism, stinking of cold-war propaganda that I am actually ashamed Trek and Roddenberry actually thought was intelligent or justified; the sheer ignorant and biased nature of the scripts political and philosophical themes is totally unnecessary and unpleasant; this is something that I never could or would associate with any respectable production of Star Trek.Furthermore the society that is presented here is ridiculous in itself, with little grey to be seen between the black and white. Instead of real characters posing a threat to the Enterprise crew, what we get is a bunch of chess pieces and nothing more; mere placeholders for personal ideals and ideas about another society that the writer clearly has no grasp of. According to 'Return of the Archons', people who serve the 'body' are nothing more than zombies, walking around speaking about peace all day. So who then made the houses, harvests the food and maintains the cities on this planet? Indeed if there is no creativity in such a society, who came up with the idea for the festival? Who designed the roads, the buildings, and the clothing which seems to be an apparent fashion rather than a uniform? So in this respect, if this is indeed a warning against the great evil of communism, then it's clearly nothing more than biased capitalist propaganda at best. Never does it discuss the pros and cons of both societies. Instead the Enterprise crew is portrayed as ignorant fools, rushing in to meld things the way they want it.Sure there is oppression present, and sure creativity should be allowed if not encouraged, but the problem with the script is that it forces such ideals down your throat and uses them unjustly- to condemn a form of society that is unified and spiritual. The problem with Landau's society isn't that it's a strong community and the problem doesn't lie in the people's nature- it lies in the obvious dictatorship of Landau, something similar to Communist Russia of the time, I admit, but not something inherent to a society that serves a 'body'.The end of the episode comes to a frustrating halt with the final discussion between Kirk and Spock on the bridge. Kirk is actually pleased that domestic quarrels have begun arising in the city and laughs it off, dismissing Spock's only intelligent line of dialogue in the episode. Oh yes, quarrelling is human alright, but so is discrimination, war, injustice, corruption and greed. Where will Kirk be when such circumstances arise? Well it's doubtful he'll be there to clean up what he naively encouraged.When it comes down to it, 'Return of the Archons' has definite potential, but it lacks the detail and discussion that such heavy topics require. So instead of being a coherent and solid piece of thoughtful science fiction, we end up with simple misguided writing with little to no intelligent discussion to justify its claims. As a piece of TV it fails also thanks to it's sluggish pace, dodgy acting from supporting cast and a distinct lack of any significance to main character development or Trek lore. There are some exciting moments here and there and a few good performances that help redeem some points but when it comes down to whether the episode works or not, 'Return of the Archons' just doesn't cut it; A real low-point for Trek.",6

I can think of nothing comparable on television at the time. It posits a strange and stagnant culture dominated by a literal Machine Messiah. As a result, it has something to say about both religion and mechanization.The original Landru must have been one hell of a genius and compelling personality. The computer ""in his image"" has held a death grip on apparently the entire planet of Beta 3 for at least 5000 years. In Landru's lifetime, the Betan technology was close to Federation level, but the computer has kept things at what looks like a late 19th century level for millenia. The power of that machine must indeed be God-like, as it seems able to spy on people almost at any time, anywhere.The resistance to Landru seems pretty feeble, since Reger and Marplon are in mortal terror of him. But the real mystery is how any resistance can exist at all after 5000 years of total domination. Certainly this was something the Archons stirred up. It would be a pretty fascinating and probably very depressing story to find out how the Archons, from an earlier age of Starfleet, survived and fought against this culture.Some viewers seem mystified by the ""Red Hour"", but the purpose of it seems pretty obvious to me. The Betans seem to be human in almost every way, including their emotional makeup. The Festival seems to act as an escape valve where the totally supressed emotions of the younger populace get some necessary release. Incidentally, the whole Red Hour sequence is one of the most bizarre and memorable scenes in Star Trek. A culture that look normal on the surface but which goes to total extremes.The episode's weakness comes in how Kirk convinces the Landru-Machine to self destruct rather easily after centuries of total domination. This is actually the first of several times Kirk outwits machine opponents. The M5 computer with Dr. Daystrom's personality seems to be the same situation as the Landru-Machine on a much smaller scale.This episode leaves you with a lot to think about. How will the Betans react once the ""god"" they've had for thousands of years is gone? Sociologist Lindstrom has quite a task on his hands. That might make a great subject for a book or story to follow up on.In the end, this is a thought-provoking piece of television for its time!",8

Kirk, Bones, Spock, and other members of their landing party try to avoid being ""absorbed"" (indoctrinated through a machine that applies an influence over those deemed a threat to the standards Landru set up for his society), looking to confront Landru and ""rescue"" the ""body"" (the name of those who make up Landru's ""ideal"" society). There are those (an underground) who look to the skies for the return of the ""archons""a race that would ""guide them"". With a heat beam from the surface of the planet caused by ""Landru"" (Spock contemplates how Landru functions like a computer, with robed security holding canes that fire rays that kill or influence the will of the leader on those considered ""evil"", bewildered by Kirk's defiance of them, ""correcting after a gap of ""reflection"" or computing the information new to them) which functions like a tractor beam hooked on the Enterprise causing them to pull towards the Earth, Kirk will need to find Landru and destroy him. Landru is a figure from 6000 years ago who seems to function as a type of projection that doesn't hear Kirk or answer his questions. Soon Kirk and Spock will confront *what* Landru really is. The Prime Directive makes its appearance here and Kirk must go up against it, seeing a society without the freedom to function as a creative people, beholden to an enslavement that forces them all to abide to the will of a leader without the opportunity to oppose him (or it, in the case of a ""law"" that governs through mental control). Kirk and Spock once again must avoid mind control or potential slavery, which includes possible death, by examining the behavior of the society and the leader that guides them. The dilemma of the Enterprise, with Scotty in command, as the beam is pulling them to their doom, and Kirk on the surface with his landing party against a ""body"" that will turn you in if you are not just like them (Kirk worrying about both those above, orbiting the planet, and those alongside him, shows the pangs of being the captain exploring the great unknowns and encountering societies of all types), produces plenty of tension.

0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Space Seed (TV Episode 1967)",Khan is my Name; Conquest is my Game,"Here we're introduced to perhaps Kirk's greatest nemesis, the product of selective breeding - eugenics - Mr. Khan (Montalban); actually, just call him Khan. Like some malignant malady waiting to be unleashed on an unsuspecting universe, he sleeps, along with his followers, drifting for over two centuries in a derelict ship. The Enterprise comes along and Capt. Kirk commits, unknowingly, a grievous error. He awakens this superman and the galaxy is no longer safe. According to the historical information presented here, Earth's 3rd world war was known as the Eugenics War and was fought in the 1990's. I've always thought, since the TNG series began with its own glimpses into Earth history, that this should have been revised to coincide with the world war that took place in the 21st century (as explained in the movie ""Star Trek:First Contact"" for example). Well, anyway...The actor Montalban simply dominates every scene he's in as the superior man, Khan. McCoy describes Khan's magnetic presence as 'almost electric.' Well, there's no 'almost' about it. Through a combination of charisma and sheer intensity, Montalban shows what's possible as far as overwhelming everything & everyone in sight, to the point that all things & people must cater to his will. Bred for this lofty ambition, he's more like a force of nature, unable to behave in any other way. Kirk, usually the more macho figure in a scene, comes away as a distant 2nd best when Khan's in the room or - as Khan would put it - 'obviously inferior.' As probably the most memorable single figure to grace the starship with his presence during the original series, Khan imparted to this episode a unique frisson and style; there's something special about this particular one, especially with the passage of 40 years. It's definitely a classic at this point and even legendary.When I saw this as a kid on a small tube, I also picked the fight scene between Kirk and Khan as my favorite for the series. Kirk put on some nice moves to avoid getting bashed by Khan's far superior strength. When I got a big screen TV and played the DVD of this episode, the stuntmen became all too apparent. Oh, well, another illusion shattered. Unlike almost all other episodes where we have to guess on what happens later after Kirk and crew made their impact known, we actually find out what happens with the seed Kirk plants here (as Spock puts it). Only the answer doesn't take place a century later, as Spock hints at; no, only about 15 years later we find out how Khan and his people are doing in the sequel to this story - ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan."" That was when, I think, Kirk really began to regret opening that chamber where Khan was harmlessly snoozing away.",9
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Space Seed (TV Episode 1967)",A landmark for Trekkers and Trekkies,"Space Seed is the first season episode of TOS which gave us Khan Noonien Singh, the eugenics wars back-story, and the situation that culminated in one of the better Star Trek films - The Wrath of Khan. For fans of the franchise, this is a landmark episode which established some important aspects of the history of the star trek universe. For non-fans, it is definitely one of the better TOS episodes, but perhaps not a legend or a classic.The Enterprise encounters a 200 year old, pre-warp drive earth vessel derelict in space and boards it. Aboard, they find dozens of people in suspended animation. As the ship begins to power up, on of the stasis compartments begins to fail and Dr. McCoy saves the man within from the brink of death. The man is Khan Noonien Singh, a product of genetic engineering. This former world leader has been engineered to be smarter, stronger, and more aggressive than normal humans. What happens is somewhat predictable (except for the excellent finish), but very satisfying because of the Coon and Wilber script, the excellent performances, and solid Marc Daniels direction.Khan is played with the pure intensity called-for in the role by Ricardo Montalban. Montalban carries every scene away, and Shatner and Nimoy - as powerful as their personalities usually are - do a great job of portraying respectful intimidation.Highly recommended for franchise fans, recommended for others.",8

Shatner and Nimoy are also excellent in this episode.This is another one of those episodes that showed the TV audience that Kirk was more than just a Captain of a ship, and even more than just a regular Starship Commander.Still, as we will find out in years to come, the ""Space Seed"" was truly planted, although it was probably not known at the time.I give this excellent episode 10 out of 10, AWESOME!! Desert-Buddha",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Space Seed (TV Episode 1967)",one of the best episodes- at least an obvious fan favorite- Ricardo Montalban's finest hour!...,"...till the Wrath of Khan that is. In a precursor to one of the finest Stark Trek films, this is the episode that introduces the 'superman' type of villain in specially-bred Khan, who came aboard the enterprise following a sort of 'dethawing' that awoke him from sleep since the 1990s. It's a fascinating episode just on the basis of how there is almost a game made out of power, of things that aren't said but intonated about who's in charge. And the title, to be sure, isn't just something suggestive. There's a power-ideal going on there too, a Darwin thing almost. Oh sure, there's the typical facet of the villain taking over the ship and making the crew choose the captain (death) or him (subservience to an Alexander-type figure). Sure there's the defector in McGievens, who lit by the cameramen to look like she's in an impressionist painting, and how she loses sight of her professional interest in history for the magnetism of his will when he says (paraphrasing) ""stay or go, but do as you truly decide"". But it's all pulled off with the utmost attention to entertainment, as well as some of the usual bright food-for-though in the Trek cannon. It's also a riot just seeing Montelban and Shatner go head to head- a kind of battle of the bulge in over-acting and machismo-steel looks- and this goes without saying that this is only the first step before things *really* went overboard on the 1982 sequel. It's wonderful pop-iconic stuff, with dashes of humor and statements on tyranny.",10
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Space Seed (TV Episode 1967)",The abusive husband.,"Trek fans, recall how the cute girls went for the abusive jocks? Here we have the egotistical brute incarnated. Believing himself to be superior to any common man, he is beyond simple pride. He exercises his desires via physical force coupled with vicious cunning. He knows only warfare and military conflict as a means to an end. He takes what he wants.Remember that guy? Remember how the cute cheerleader always went for him? Well, so it is with the Enterprise's ship's historian Lieutenant McGivers, who gives in to her romanticism with a historic figure brought to life before her. Her inner passions form a symbiosis with some inner instinct to find a successful male, and she betrays both her higher intellect and oath to Star Fleet because of it. McGivers is cute, alluring, attractive, but her inner desire to see a child with the successful code of the antagonist is her own down bringing. She succumbs to his interpersonal tyranny, mistaking his anger-filled desire for power respected by other males. So it is in the real world.Ah, but the ""superior man"", adeptly played by the late Ricardo Montablan, with all of his intellect and physical prowess, is no match for knowledge and wisdom, tempered by Star Fleet training. The former ""Napoleon"" of the past and would be tyrant of the future is confronted with a kind of understanding beyond his ken. It is in fact why he failed on Earth centuries before, and perhaps why the many McGivers and Kahns in the contemporary western world divorce.Can we blame McGivers for her weakness in not following her intellect, by letting her baser instincts dictate her actions? No more than that cute cheerleader falling for the egotistical jock that plays brutal and mean spirited pranks on those whose brain and brawn are more balanced.Again, Trek shows us that not just brute strength, not just pure intellect, but a melding of those elements interwoven with wisdom and caring brings forth the best in men. One without the other is a weakness, and when that is energized with an innate superiority complex, only disaster can follow; the bully; the abusive husband, the tyrant.On a more Trek oriented vein, as other have mentioned, this is indeed the ""Space Speed"" not just in the name of the title, but in fact the genesis for one of the most popular of the Star Trek films. I speak of none other than Star Trek 2, the Wrath of Kahn, where emotional, physical and space ship battles run paramount. It is a memorable film tying old Trek with then state of the art effects, and updating characters and story line.As Trekker and Trekkies we watch and are reminded of the parable presented by this episode, and appreciate not just the thesping from the usual gang of suspects, but Ricardo Montablan who himself keenly observed that villains do not know that they are villains. It is a lesson for many a cute girl who fell for the brute. Too bad they're not Star Trek fans.Watch and enjoy.",

I know every line and every scene by heart. It's great fun to read reviews from 2008 of this TV show from 1967. That shows how strong the material is.For me, the best part is Marc Daniels's direction. Visually, Daniels does such a great job here that the show serves as an example to young filmmakers. This episode serves as an excellent example of the potential for TV to be deeply compelling.Kirk meets his match in Kahn, the thoroughly vicious, absolute ruler of 25% of 1990's Earth and product of controlled breeding who has been in suspended animation for two centuries. I can't remember when the idea of genetic superiority has been as simply and brutally told--at least on TV. I think that's why the story resonates with so many people; and why people are still writing about it today.Many of us (guys) have had experiences with bullies on playgrounds in our youth. This episode brings the bully into the science fiction canon. Montalban's Khan is genuinely menacing; leading to a thoroughly rich climax. Naturally this involves a fight between Kirk and Khan (and the stunt men, who are pretty obvious) over control of the Enterprise. I love how Kirk wins the fight; it suggests that while Khan has the superior physique, Kirk possibly has the greater will to win.They don't make TV anywhere close to this anymore. I'd rather watch Space Seed over and over before seeing any contemporary TV show.",10

Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise in The Wrath Of Khan.But William Shatner's first encounter came when the Enterprise discovers an old earth style space ship containing several cryogenically frozen bodies. Later we learn that these frozen people are enhanced genetic humans and were part of a Eugenics War, something we can look forward to in our future. But being the advanced and civilized folks on earth we've become, we don't kill them we just blast them into space into space to land wherever and fend for themselves.But Shatner releases Montalban from his frozen tomb and his enhanced mind catches up on a whole lot of history and advances in science. Soon he has big ambitions and he needs the Enterprise to fulfill them. Montalban enlists Enterprise crew member Madelyn Rhue to help him. Rhue finds him charismatic and somewhat irresistible.By dint of the fact that Khan came back in a feature film you know that he's going to live in the end.

7,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Space Seed (TV Episode 1967)",Produces an Interesting Concept; Looks Ahead,"During the first season of the original series there is no way that the producers had a thought about a movie sequel to this series. We all know how tenuous even a second season was for this expensive show. Thanks to the fans they took a chance and the rest is history. In this episode, the charismatic Ricardo Montalban plays Khan, a genetically engineered being whose purpose for existence, along with his crew, is domination. Shades of Hitler and other historical conquerers. The Enterprise and James T. Kirk always seem to err on the side of compassion, and this gets them into hot water in this episode. Upon entering Khan's ship, their suspended animation modules are opened and he fills his lungs with air and starts his conquest. His response to kindness is to manipulate it to his own purposes. His first act when he awakens in sick bay is to threaten McCoy with a knife. McCoy tells him how to sever the carotid artery and this makes Khan laugh and, hence, spare the good doctor. A beautiful young crewman, who has already started to drool over Khan (women weren't always portrayed as that evolved on this show), is enlisted by the manipulator to assist him. He is cruel and she is submissive. She will play a part later. Of course, once he has a foothold, he takes over the ship, bringing his once sleeping crew to the Enterprise, starting to dismantle the ship. The strength of performances and some very good writing help this episode becomes one of the better ones. It is a battle of wits between Kirk and Kahn that makes this work. I need to watch ""The Wrath of Khan"" again.",10
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Space Seed (TV Episode 1967)","I loved the movie this episode spawned, but think it's pretty ordinary otherwise","Wow--this episode is rated higher than 9 on IMDb!!! This actually surprises me, since while good, it is not among the better episodes. I only think the episode stands out because the main character created in the show led to the STAR TREK II: WRATH OF KHAN movie--one of the greatest Star Trek movies ever. But, apart from Khan, little of this episode makes it to the movie. Also, the biggest problem I have about the episode is the ""stupid and impressionable female"" cliché. In too many shows and movies, women often make incredibly stupid choices based on god knows what! This crew member joins Khan in his attack on the Enterprise and there just isn't a credible reason to think this could ever happen--unless the woman was a total idiot. And, hopefully, Star Fleet Command isn't an organization that hires idiots!!! Anyways, Richardo Montalban is magnetic and fun to watch, plus he's one of the few characters who ever out-emoted an over-acted more than Kirk!! I actually love all the cheesy over-acting--it's fun to watch these two macho guys trying to outdo each other.",7
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Space Seed (TV Episode 1967)","""There's something inside this man that refuses to accept death"".","There's an interesting aspect to this episode that no other reviewer has touched on, so I think that's where I'll start. Roddenberry and his writers, Gene Coon and Carey Wilbur, take a crack at speculating what Earth might be like in the 1990's - Earth on the verge of a Dark Age and entire populations being bombed out of existence. Although we've gotten an additional decade behind us now, there's something to be said about a Dark Age with the threat of a 'New World Order' leading to global government. The War to End Tyranny, or as Khan preferred, the War to Unify Humanity draws eerie similarities to the present state of world affairs. Political elitists look to a single unifying figure who promises to be 'The One', the one who has all the answers and whose intellect is conceivably greater than the sum of all other intellects combined. Rubbish. Spock's analysis - ""Superior ability breeds super ambition"" may be true, but in the last analysis, never leads to superior results.Which is why the resolution to this episode leaves me somewhat baffled. Why didn't Captain Kirk realize that a Khan unleashed, even if exiled to a far flung planet, would ultimately lead to eventual chaos? The ending just doesn't sit right with me, especially when you consider the slap on the wrist for McGivers (Madlyn Rhue). Why just two episodes earlier, Kirk stood trial for court martial for a 'mistake', while here, McGivers actually commits treason. I mean really, where's the justice. This was a decision totally against the grain of Kirk's training, not to mention his character.What's good about the episode is Ricardo Montalban's compelling portrayal of Khan - impassioned and ruthless. This was perhaps Star Trek's greatest villain, if not the TV series, then certainly when elevated to the status of feature film outlaw. It's been a while now since I saw ""The Wrath of Khan"", but I'm certainly inclined to do so again as I renew my interest in Star Trek lore. Khan - even the name invokes mystery and suspense. All the best single name villains do.",8

This is the only episode that spawned a Star Trek movie - that being Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. It starred the incredible actor Ricardo Montalban (also in the aforementioned movie as well as other films such as The Naked Gun) as the ""superior"" Khan Noonian Singh who is revived after 2 centuries (he is from the 1990s) in suspended animation. Though the crew of the Enterprise don't know who he is at first, it soon becomes frighteningly obvious. This is truly a classic episode that everyone should see, especially if you want to understand the events that brought on ""the Wrath of Khan"".",
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Space Seed (TV Episode 1967)",Star Trek: The Original Series - Space Seed,"While this episode's importance in Trek lore is substantial in regards to the magnificent Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, I think it is basically a ""Kirk must stop the next superior being from taking his ship"" plot. Genetically engineered and enhanced super-humans sent into space in suspended animation out of the 1990s eugenic wars where their ship veers off course due to mechanical failure, drifting into deep space. The Enterprise encounters the Botany Bay (named from a penal colony in Australia), and Khan, the leader of this race of highly intelligent, supremely strong humans, is awakened by Kirk and the away team who find them asleep in canisters, waiting to be released from their slumber. Khan was programmed to be awakened first, recuperating at an alarming rate as his physiology was meant to do. Soon Khan eyes the Enterprise (of course) as the ship to lead him on adventures of conquering and conquest. Madlyn Rhue is the historian who falls hard for Khan, even cowering to his demands and desires. Khan using force to send Rhue to bended knee, dumping her to the ground, refusing to show affection as much as animal magnetism and authoritarian attitude might make feminists want to throw their drink at the screen. Very much a physical and confident performance from Ricardo Montalban, that noticeable arrogance and preening assurance, all that pride and stamina, makes for quite a memorable villain Kirk must upend somehow. It doesn't get much better than seeing Kirk and Khan mano a mano; fists, chops, body throws, and takedowns literally for control of the Enterprise. The final words of Kirk are certainly foreshadowing for what was to come...Kirk and Khan would never meet psychically again, but would match wits. That Khan would describe Kirk as inferior in every way and lose to him twice (Rhue helping him the first time, as Khan had Kirk locked in a hypobaric chamber, losing air) has its irony. The character of Khan is what makes this episode favorable as the plot services Montalban's charismatic presence and star power. He expects to be in charge, to command, and to dominate... unfortunately he encountered James T Kirk. The planet depicted as habitable by Spock, with Kirk ""granting"" Khan a planet to rule, only to later learn that it was a horrible world with plenty of horrors, certainly establishes what would fuel the revenge plot of the second Star Trek film.",7
12,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Space Seed (TV Episode 1967)",The Mexican Sikh.,"One of the more prominent/popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst. A red-shirt female falls for Khan (instead of dropping dead - for a change) and then proceeds to betray Kirk and the Enterprise as if loyalty were a non-existent character trait on the ship. Makes one wonder what kind of psychology tests this supposedly brilliant Starfleet uses to test people when hiring. We have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in ""Wink Of An Eye"", when a red-shirt male takes the enemy's side just because he falls in love! Same as in SS. (However, in that episode the betrayal plays a tiny role in the overall plot.) This is very silly because it once again makes Kirk's crew seem like a bunch of soft-headed, easy-to-impress morons, who - once they fall in love with the enemy - are capable of doing just about anything. The fact that McGivers switches back to Kirk's side doesn't ameliorate the illogic in any way. Lord McGiveth and the Lord McTaketh...Why is Khan kept behind a regular door when they know he has superior strength? That's one of several ST plot-devices that undermine Kirk's intelligence. Why does Khan hold a knife against McCoy's throat? If Khan is of such superior intelligence then one would expect him to be more wily with the way he carries himself. And what's with a Sikh being played with a Latino accent? Montalban should have been provided with a vocal coach. I was half-expecting to hear ""the plaaain! the plaaaain!"" in the background at any moment. Why the hell would Kirk (or any ship captain) provide limitless use of the ship's library concerning the innermost technical details of the Enterprise to ANYONE? Is the Starfleet an institution solely consisting of idiots? SS is a very cartoonish, silly episode, so no wonder Trekkies love it. It doesn't have too many sci-fi elements in it, which is what Trekkies hate the most. It also figures that the ST franchise chose to revive this dull character for the second movie, that way pleasing rabid Trekkies, who were so very disappointed with the first movie which - you guessed it - had far too much sci-fi for the average tiny Trekkie brain.",
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Space Seed (TV Episode 1967)",Sex in space,"This episode is hard to rate, so I'll give it a 7, ie fairly good. A 300 year old vessel is discovered, carrying humans from the 1990's that have been cryogenic-ally preserved. We are introduced to the ship's historian, one Lt McGivers, whom Captain Kirk requests come along in the landing party due to her vast knowledge of ancient history. By the offhand way Kirk refers to her, mispronouncing her name, we are given to understand she doesn't get many important assignments around the Enterprise. From the appearance of her quarters, she has plenty of time after work to indulge in her hobby, painting her historic heroes.Lt McGivers takes one look at the reawakened Khan, the leader of the ancient vessel, and falls deep in lust. The sexual tension is palpable. Too palpable. It seems like the boys on the Enterprise have been paying the lieutenant no mind, because she is one very lonely woman, who is soon helping Khan take over the ship. Of course, it is helpful for Khan that all the information about the ship's design is located on the computer that Kirk gives him access to, including emergency procedures for use with intruders. Major plot hole. Khan takes over the ship with McGivers at his side, however when she sees the crew start to be brutalized by Khan, she changes her mind and saves the day. She is subsequently given the option of court martial or leaving with Khan and his crew, and chooses the latter.A contrived plot with a ""historian"" crew member, never seen again, and plenty of holes. Then we have Richard Montalbo, playing Khan, who is the ultimate 1960's stereotype of a ""sexy man"". Not one of my favorite episodes for this reason, trite and predictable.

As the away team explore the ship one of crew starts to wake up; he is taken to the Enterprise sickbay and quickly recovers. It turns out the ship, the Botany Bay, was launched during the Eugenics War of the 1990s when a group of genetically modified supermen ruled the world and this survivor is Khan; one of the most infamous. It isn't long before Khan is planning to continue where he left off by seizing the Enterprise. To this end he is assisted by the ship's historian Lt. Marla McGivers; an attractive redhead who is fascinated by powerful historical figures.This episode's claim to fame is that it introduces Khan and sets up things for the excellent 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan' feature film. Ricardo Montalban does a fine job as the genetically 'improved' Khan; a charismatic but obviously dangerous character. Madlyn Rhue does a decent job as Lt. McGivers even if it is hard to believe her character would fall for Khan and commit treason so quickly! The idea of genetic modification is interesting although it would have been more believable if it had happened much later than the 1990s surely when this was made the creators didn't think such advances might happen in a quarter of a century! The discussion of the Eugenics Wars leads to some enjoyable conversations between McCoy and Spock.

Ricardo Montalban does a fine job here as ""Khan"", a genetically engineered ""superman"" from the 1990's (from the perspective of the 1967 TV episode).This was one of the better episodes of the original series and featured strong writing, direction, and action. The willful compliance of Lieutenant McGivers was annoying but perhaps understandable-- women do seem to like aggressive men, even sometimes to their own detriment.Khan's physical superiority was not too ridiculously exaggerated here, as it would be in the rebooted movie. Here, Kirk had a credible chance of defeating Khan with some 'dirty' fighting and use of weaponry. I was always curious to see how Spock would do in a physical fight with Khan and that curiosity was actually rewarded in the rebooted movie to my pleasant surprise. One point of difference, though, is that the nerve pinch worked in this episode but didn't work in the rebooted version. The reason is rather obvious; the nerve pinch would have resulted in a very short fight indeed.This episode does suffer from several serious mistakes made by Kirk here. The first was in giving Khan far too ready access to the ship's technical manuals, to a man who was potentially dangerous. The second was in failing to take adequate security precautions to hold Khan. The third, and worst by far, was in just letting Khan go, thereby preserving and even fostering a serious threat for the Federation.

Khan's natural instincts are to conquer and he does just this as him and his cohorts take over control of the Enterprise. After Kirk is somehow able to outwit and outbrawn him, he decides to leave the last of the Augments on an unconquered, savage planet to see if their society will truly flourish.Khan! The episode may have seen fairly typical at the time but it meant so much more for the future of the franchise and the Star Trek universe as a whole. Ricardo Montalban's performance as Khan is absolutely delectable. I completely understand why they chose to bring him back for ST2.The entire idea of the Eugenics Wars is an interesting one and I like that they give us just enough information on it to make us intrigued without spelling it all out for us. The crew's caution of having Khan aboard is obviously justified when he attempts to take over command. This is one of the episodes where Kirk doesn't act like a bit of a naive fool for the convenience of the plot. It's nice.The only issue I have with this episode is the portrayal of Marla McGivers. To see her character, a well educated, empowered female officer, turn into a person that swoons over this man and ceases being a human being, turning into an emotional slave for Khan, is difficult to stomach. The writers attempt to write this off as a mixture of lust and professional interest (an onboard historian? okay Star Trek...). She really just comes across as the manipulated party in a toxic relationship. I felt a bit sad for her character when she decides to follow the violent, arrogant Khan to the new planet.Despite superior intellect and strength, Kirk is able to best Khan relatively easily. I find this hard to understand. The fight scene though is very exciting (even if you can clearly see Shatner's stunt doubles on modern HD). Kirk's decision to release Khan comes back to bite him in the ass but I'm getting ahead of myself. A solid entry into Season 1 of Star Trek.

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. Unlike any other hit series, it only has 3 seasons so luckily it means that they will be covering up all their ideas within it until they are satisfied. As it often happens, the first season is always promising and has potential (or else it won't lift up for further more seasons) in it and is utilized with fine detailed work like focusing on different new breeds and characters bonding through this journey.Khan being one of the most famous and powerful nemesis of the enterprise makes his first appearance in here and justifies his hype by his superior skills i.e. physically and mentally and is fortunately supported too by explicit writing and perfect screenplay that won't fail to surprise and satisfy the viewers.",

0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Taste of Armageddon (TV Episode 1967)",Often wrongfully dismissed.,"The few reviews of this episode have given it a dismissive treatment, and for some very superficial reasons.Consider; the ""aliens"" are ostensibly Anglo North Americans who speak perfect North American English, the computers are from the age of vacuum tubes, there's little in the way of cultural adornment, and the production values, even for a classic Trek episode, seem to be a little on the low side.But, if one merely looks at it for its gloss, then the viewer is missing the larger theme of this very profound episode (as many classic Trek episodes tend to be).In years past when two factions contended over resources, they fought man to man. There was a sense of personal jeopardy when engaging in combat. There was a stake involved on all levels; national, communal, and personal.In ""A Taste of Armageddon"", we're shown the pitfalls of automating international conflict; i.e. warfare. Or, in this case, interplanetary warfare. We're shown a society that's become heartless by trying to preserve it's social life at all costs. And this is where the episode should hit the most astute of viewers.Today, in the United States, we live in a push button society. At the click of a mouse we can call up any fantasy we want via the computer. In the real world this kind of mechanical symbiosis is taken to the next level by calling up death with the click of a mouse by a seaman in a submarine or a remote control pilot firing a hellfire missile from a predator drone. We now pick and choose our targets, almost seemingly on a whim.The idea is to minimize death and destruction. A kind of jujitsu approach to warfare via defanging the opposition. Anon 7 states the reasons for this approach to warfare, but Kirk reminds of what it is he and the rest of his people are afraid of.The speech delivered at the end by Captain James T. Kirk is typical Shatner-esquire drama. The words he delivers should strike home for anyone who's ever thought of organized warfare on any level. This is the heart of the story. This is the message, and a warning for future generations.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Taste of Armageddon (TV Episode 1967)","They Fight Their War with Computers, Captain","A clever sf concept on how a different society may wage their wars: totally by computers. In their supposed enlightened method, the buildings and their culture continue - the populace obediently reports to disintegration chambers to fulfill an agreement with the enemy planet after each computerized attack. It all sounds very clinical, very clean, if not a bit on the 'patriotism gone mad' spectrum - but it's probably the clinical aspect which outrages Kirk the most; that and the fact that his beloved starship is declared a target almost immediately. I don't think he even remembers, at this point, that another Federation ship was lost 50 years earlier in this manner - it's his ship what counts. To be fair to this society on Eminiar, they did warn the Enterprise to stay away from their system; but the problem here again is an annoying Federation bureaucrat, ambassador Fox (see also the previous ""The Galileo 7"" for another such representative). Fox places more value on a successful diplomatic mission than on the lives of all the crew and the ship. This does not endear him to Kirk, Scotty, or the audience, for that matter.Speaking of Scotty, he had some of his best scenes of the first season here. Placed in command of the Enterprise for most of the episode, he gets to shine in his confrontations with Fox and the 'mealy-mouthed' Anan-7 down on the planet. My favorite scene is when he informs Anan-7 that the Enterprise will destroy the surface of the planet in less than two hours. It sounds horrible when described this way, but it's almost a validation of a starship's power and, by extension, Starfleet, and actor Doohan learned by this point how to infuse as much melodramatic impact on such pronouncements as possible. We secretly thrill to this opportunity Scotty has in throwing his starship's weight around - following Kirk's orders, of course. For Kirk, it's his chance to play God once more (see the previous ""Return of the Archons""), literally transforming an entire culture overnight - not in theory, but in practice! To be fair to the captain, one can argue his hand was forced after his ship was targeted but...I, for one, get the sense he's really enjoying himself - give him any excuse; he'll change the way a planet does things soon enough, maybe even as retribution for daring to threaten his ship.Still, the society of Eminiar poses many questions and problems, despite the outward appearance of prosperity and technological comfort (another nice matte painting here, though not as successful as previous ones for Starbase 11 in ""The Menagerie"" and ""Court Martial""). Anan-7 (Opatoshu in a nicely-layered performance) himself inadvertently suggests where the priorities of this so-called culture lie when he tells Kirk that he'll try to spare his starship but the human beings inside it are definitely goners. Things - material things - definitely take precedence over humanity here. There's something inherently repulsive about living thinking beings marching into oblivion at the 'suggestion' of computer results - another aspect making this similar to ""Return of the Archons"" - like so much programmed ants. I could understand Kirk's disgust and I noticed Spock was on his side all the way without even a word of debate about something called The Prime Directive.",8

But, despite this and the lack of a lot of action in the show, it stands out as one of the best episodes because it is so well-written and has an intriguing message. It seems that the Enterprise visits a new planet while they are being attacked by their enemies on a nearby planet. However, despite the landing party hearing the warnings, the see, hear and feel no evidence of attack. It turns out that the attack is a computer simulation and the ship (but not the landing party) are determined by the computer to be casualties in this bizarre game. However, despite not being real, this really is no game. You see, the two planets completely hate each other and would have completely annihilated each other with their high-tech weapons countless decades before had both sides not agreed to stop fighting a conventional war and begin fighting a computerized one. The logic was that BOTH societies could be preserved and the ""victims"" could be humanely euthanized to make the war more tolerable!!! This sick arrangement seems natural to the planet's inhabitants and they cannot understand why the crew of the ship refuse to report to the disintegration chambers in order to preserve the precarious balance and avoid a real all-out war!!!! The episode is exciting, thought-provoking and features an excellent performance by guest-star David Opatoshu--an exceptional character actor who was a frequent guest on TV (such as his great role in one of the hour-long TWILIGHT ZONE episodes).",9

Left in charge of the Enterprise while Kirk and Spock are detained on Eminiar VII, the chief engineer engages and wins in a battle of wills with a witless Federation Ambassador Fox (Gene Lyons). Most definitely Scotty's finest hour so far in the first season.What's intriguing to me about this episode is it's resemblance to a Twilight Zone episode that aired only four years earlier called 'Valley of the Shadow'. In that story, a traveler wanders into a peaceful, idyllic town, where there is no crime, violence, greed or illness. He's held there against his will when he discovers the technological secrets that create this utopia. The dilemma posed for the viewer is whether all this serenity is worth trading for one's personal freedom.Taking a slightly different tack, 'A Taste of Armageddon' offers a clinical approach to conducting wars in the future, whereby a computer 'game' analyzes opponents' strategies and weapons, and engineers an outcome that the enemies must adhere to, or face the prospect of total annihilation. It's a different spin on still another earlier ST episode, 'Arena', one in which warring parties put up their own champion to represent their side.What it boils down to is Roddenberry presenting a chilling commentary on what's at stake when people and nations surrender their identity to an ephemeral 'greater good'. With mathematically launched attacks and carefully calculated casualties, the 'elitist' class gets to preside over the little people who have to take the hit for the benefit of their superiors. The references are subtle, but creator Roddenberry takes a big swing at the agenda of all statists, that is, to keep the masses afraid, and under their thumb.Getting back to that Twilight Zone episode, guess who's the leader of the town fathers who preside over Peaceful Valley. It's none other than David Opatoshu! He brings the same sense of austere and clinical discipline to his role as Anan 7 here, as he did to the character of Dorn in the TZ story. But wait, there's more! There's a little girl in that story that inadvertently reveals the town's technology to the unwitting traveler who's detained. The father of the girl was Scotty! - James Doohan in a strangely prophetic first meeting on Earth with Opatoshu, before coming together in outer space.",8
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Taste of Armageddon (TV Episode 1967)",A solid episode dealing with computer war,"Ambassador Fox wins my award for the stupidest, most belligerent Federation representative ever to come aboard the Enterprise. This guy is so full of himself, he's willing to ignore Code 710 and risk the Enterprise (and perhaps interstellar war) simply because he's convinced his diplomatic capabilities can overcome any obstacles. Despite the high probability that Kirk and the landing party have been taken hostage, and despite an obvious attack against the Enterprise from Eminiar VII, Fox ignores the sound advice of Scotty and the rest of the bridge crew and storms ahead with his ill-fated attempt at negotiating a treaty to secure a spaceport. All in all, I find this episode very entertaining. Anan 7 seems pretty ruthless, Ambassador Fox has you throwing tomatoes at the screen whenever he's visible, and I always like it when Kirk and company are stealthily sneaking around blasting everything in sight. And the idea of a war fought totally by computers gets you thinking. We're really not that far away from that type of reality, where the ease of waging war makes it easy to forget the horrors behind it. I'm giving ""A Taste of Armageddon"" a B+ grade and setting up my own disintegration machine to help motivate my kids to get their homework done.",8

Thousands are still dying - regardless of whether buildings are destroyed or not. And would two cultures conditioned to war for over five hundred years really be so concerned with how rationally and politely they made their war - or would they be utterly merciless, vicious and cold?

Very obscure, it was only published first in Collier's magazine in the 1950s and the only book publication was a paperback original in the 1960s (available for a couple of bucks on abebooks if anyone is interested). Wouk's book is the journal of the first man to visit the moon where he discovers that two human-like civilizations live underground there and have been at perpetual war for thousands of years. However, long ago, it was decided that while war is a normal human activity, it was foolish to let it wreck your civilizations, so wars are now fought in the abstract by having each side demonstrate their potential to defeat the other and then having a neutral panel of judges decide the victor and then assess the amount of property and lives each side must voluntarily sacrifice to reflect the outcome.

I think its because the arrogant get their comeuppance. It involves a diplomatic mission to quite an advanced planet, Eminiar, rich in technology. The Enterprise has been warned away, but Kirk feels he needs to check things out. What he finds is civilization that has been at war with another planet for centuries. However, they fight their war with computers. Buildings and material objects are spared, but the people voluntarily allow themselves to be disintegrated in death chambers. Enter Fox, an insufferable negotiator who thinks that he can talk his way through the barriers put up by Anan 7, the leader of the planet. Because Kirk and Spock are stuck on the planet, Scotty takes the helm. The problem is that the computer has informed Anan 7 that the entire crew of the Enterprise has been designated as war casualties, and he has told Kirk to get his crew to the surface and have them report to the death chambers. Despite the Prime Directive, Kirk isn't going to have any of this. He finds Anan 7's reasoning disgusting. War is supposed to be a dirty thing, meant to be avoided, not some sterile thing. Of course, Kirk also hooks up with Anan's daughter who is beautiful and also listed as a casualty. The sparks fly for a while and I find the conclusion really quite satisfying.",9
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Taste of Armageddon (TV Episode 1967)",Calculated Warfare,"Warning do not read unless seen episode.This I thought was a very good episode if not quite one of my favorites. It's pretty much another dystopian story but the concept in this episode I feel is frighteningly plausible. It sort of reminds me of the kind of society in the ""Colossus"" book trilogy which was also about people that have given up their free will to the will of a computer consciousness.It's an interesting concept seeing how war are conducting though playing some sort of strategy computer game, kinda like in the book ""Ender's Game"" where video/computer games were used for certain means.What's disturbing is the undervalue of life of most of the populace. As each of them must comply to the computer's casualty calculation list, depending on the number most whether picked or not must march right to some sort of chamber of disintegration. It's sort of like with cultists dying for a false ideal.Depite the fact that this type of warfare grants some sort of peace, as there is no property damage, envoirmental damage, injury, resource reduction. It's a false peace because it's evil your all the same committing murder, the technological warfare is barbarism in the guise of civility. It's true that actual warfare is messy business but at least there is still the power of choice where people can still choice to stop or find a better way.Both Kirk and Scotty are at their best in this episode. Most notably Scotty whom kinda steels the show in the episode despite the fact throughout the episode he's on the ship.It was just great seeing him in command of the enterprise, he's a really capable in the captain role. I really love the fact that he's not bending toward this so called diplomat whom is obviously not being very diplomatic. One moment that was great was when this diplomat is trying to order even threaten Scotty to lower the screens and comply to the wishes of the leader of the planet. But Scotty doesn't bend like any good captain his duty is to his ship and crew no matter what, Scotty calls bull crap on the leader and doesn't comply to the diplomat when he says I won't lower those screens, sort of his way of saying, ""Your not the boss of me."" I couldn't help but cheer a little but it's also demonstrates one of the themes of the episode on the importance of free will, Scotty exercised well as like any good person isn't going to give his trust or follow orders from anyone he doesn't know.Kirk was also great as he is finding a way to survive but also put an end to the society if possible. I really like these conversations he has with the leader of the planet where he is constantly accusing Kirk of being a barbarian. However the difference between both him and Kirk is Kirk can openly admit it making him a truthful person; where the Leader denys it making him a complete hypocrite. And despite the fact Kirk is barbaric that doesn't mean he'll decide to kill today or do anything destructive because he has the power of choice. Where the leader and his people inadvertently kill just about every day and don't stop because they've given up the power of choice.In a way the episode is a lesson on the danger of giving up complete control to technology, importance of free will, but also how war is easy it's peace that is hard.Rating: 3 and a half stars",9

The look of disgust and incredulity on Kirk's face is priceless when he asks head of the planet's high council, Anon 7, ""You mean to tell me..that your people..just..walk..into a disintegration machine when they're told to?"" And of course, later on he gets Anon to practically pee his pants when he tells him, ""You heard me give General Order 24, that means that in two hours, the Enterprise will destroy Eminiar 7.""Then we have Scotty, who has to deal with the arrogant and clueless Federation Ambassador Fox, who is bound and determined to open diplomatic relations with this planet in spite of a) first receiving a message saying under no circumstances are they to approach the planet b) receiving a fake message from Anon 7 (talking through a voice duplicator to sound like Kirk) to lure the ship's personnel ashore (the ship has been declared a ""war casualty"" in this computer war), and c) getting fired upon. The last part is particularly exasperating for Scotty, as the ambassador won't let him return fire, to which Scotty snorts, ""Diplomats. The best diplomat I know is a fully activated phaser bank!"" Here we have yet another example of people acting like robots; obeying orders sent down by their government even when it means marching to their death, like the Jews in Nazi Germany, so many of whom dutifully marched into concentration camps (OK, to be fair, that happened mainly before the ""final solution"" mass murders, but nonetheless). It's also an interesting take on how an alien society avoids some of the nasty aspects of war to maintain their ""civilization,"" such as it is. As Kirk correctly pointed out, ""Death, destruction, disease, horror..that's what war is all about, Anon. It's what makes it a thing to be avoided. But you've made it neat and painless. So neat and painless that you've found no reason to stop it. And you've had it for 500 years. Since it seems to be the only way that I can save my crew, and my ship, I'm going to end it for you, one way or the other."" And that he does. Alas, he doesn't implement General Order 24.",9
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" A Taste of Armageddon (TV Episode 1967)",A sanitised but deadly war,"The Enterprise is on a mission to open diplomatic relations between the Federation and Eminiar VII but as they approach they are ordered to stay clear of the planet. Diplomat Ambassador Robert Fox orders Kirk to continue so he can continue his mission regardless. To ensure it is safe Kirk, Spock and three red-shirts beam down to the surface. They find an advanced civilisation and receive a friendly welcome however they soon find out that Eminiar VII is at war with a neighbouring planet and an attack occurs while they are there. This is no ordinary war though; no actual bombs are dropped so there are no injuries and no structural damage however there are real fatalities those declared 'killed' must report to be disintegrated. Nobody refuses to comply for fear of real bombs being used again. The rules also include ships in orbit and that includes the Enterprise! Not surprisingly Kirk has no intention of sacrificing his crew and decides to end this strange war hoping real war with all the suffering it entails will lead to peace.This episode features an interesting concept although it seems a little unlikely that any society would continue a war for five hundred years without trying to negotiate a peace even if it was highly sanitised. Still if one can suspend ones disbelief about that it is a fine story with a good mixture of action and drama. Gene Lyons puts in an enjoyable performance as Ambassador Fox; the diplomat who seems to make the wrong decision at every opportunity but eventually proves his worth. David Opatoshu is also good as Eminiar leader Anan 7 who is convinced that their way of war is more civilised. With Kirk and Spock trapped on the surface Scotty is left in charge of the Enterprise leading to some fun scenes that give James Doohan more to do than usual. Overall a pretty good episode with plenty of tension and a solid enough story.",8

But the alternative-- simple peace-- is really pretty obvious. I give the episode some credit for starting with a moderately interesting idea, but the solution is so obvious that the episode can hardly be considered to be a great one.Indeed, another simple alternative would have been precisely what the USA and the USSR had for many years: mutually assured destruction (MAD), thereby preventing either side from ever initiating an attack. Even if negotiations were impracticable, MAD would surely be preferable to ongoing death.Scotty got a chance to shine here, refusing to back down against the dim-witted ambassador and preserving the safety of the ship.Where was Sulu? Yeoman Tamura seemed to be his 'sub' for the episode.This episode featured the usual silly fight scenes with Kirk, which appeared to be thrown in purely for spectacle; they have unintended comedic camp value.",5

This planet's leader David Opatoshu explains that this has been going on for five hundred years, but instead of trying to resolve their differences, they and their opposition have arrived at a peculiar solution. War is done like a video game and incidentally just the anticipation of video games is something Gene Roddenberry could take some bows for. These games are for real because on this planet and the other when a hit is scored, the computer calculates the casualties and people are just shuttled to a disintegration chamber and annihilated. Nice and neat with the proper number of casualties and the buildings and culture intact. As Captain Kirk remarks real war is a very messy business.I agree with another reviewer who says that this episode has some profound things to say about war, man's nature and the need to overcome the beast to allow us to live together.

Sadly, human sacrifice to appease idols was commonly done in pagan societies of the past - Aztecs, etc. If I was doing this episode, I would have the computers doing the warfare to be their idols/gods, and the people sacrificed against their will.

As I always started out not paying attention, it took me years to figure out what Lucy's stunt was in that episode) We are given the explanation that the two planets have a computerized war. Only when Kirk and Spock teleport down are they told that the Enterprise is now victims of this war and must be vaporized (executed, cremated, take your pick) Undeniably, the brilliant performance by David Opatoshu as the leader of this world who calmly and emotionally pleads for the death of the Enterprise crew is the standout. Barbara Babcock is all but wasted in her appearance (which, truth be told, she was also unused in her other appearance on this show that I can think of, but she's lovely nonetheless) By description alone, you wouldn't think such a character could be worth watching for an hour (forty-something minutes, again, pick) But Opatoshu makes it worthwhile. As another review noted, his exchanges with Scotty are magnificent, again, mainly for Opatoshu, but Doohan holds his ground.Added to the mix is a disagreeable, bewildered ambassador who is quite literally thrown for a loop when he teleports down (Scotty's explanation of this fellow's actions to Kirk also stand out) The ending may seem cut and dry, but Opatoshu's attempts throughout the entire episode leading up to it are fantastic.Opatoshu would win an Emmy for Gabriel's Fire. Clearly it was more of an award to recognize his career, perhaps most for this episode here. Well worth it.",10

Yep, the computer tells Anon 7 that the Enterprise was selected as victims of war, insisting Kirk have his crew beam down and suicide themselves! Nope, not going to happen. So Kirk, Spock, and those who beamed down with him must find a way to break free from imprisonment, avoid dying also, and destroy the machines resulting in continual death after 500 years of it. So these wargames have been a part of the planet and another rival planet for 500 years, Kirk was advised to not bring his ship in contact with Emeniar but the diplomatic ambassador on board (Gene Lyons, as Ambassador Fox) insisted he do so resulting in the Enterprise becoming inadvertently involved, and Kirk and Spock destroy the disintegration machines and computers that have been integral parts of the society and their way of life. Diplomacy and rescuing his ship are on Kirk's mind. His bouts with Anon 7, who insists that this process of suicide is the only way to keep both planets safe from war, famine, and the horrors of violence that have been intercepted by the voluntary decision of those selected by the computers to offer themselves, are the episode's chief conflict, as is Scotty's direct opposition to persistent Fox who sees only the mission of peace despite all the warnings that Eminiar is untrustworthy. Scotty refusing to drop the shields as Fox demands to show Eminiar that their intentions are peaceful could have led to his trip to a penal colony, but the decision turns out to be quite the smart thing to do. Fox beams down with his attaché and is nearly introduced to the disintegration machine!I think how Kirk defies the Prime Directive's rule that they must not interfere could be a divisive topic of debate for viewers. If he doesn't interfere millions could continue to kill themselves, but is he really permitted to do so? Ultimately, he escapes from the doldrums of his interference, as Fox gets his way, as Anon 7 folds, accepting the opportunity for peace talks with their rival planet. Fox sees the warring planets coming to peace terms as the chance for the Federation to become an ally of both parties as well. Kirk also sees his ship safe, his away team returning without death, and the planet doomed to continue offering up its own because a computer told them so is influenced by his actionshe's conveniently a steward of change, regardless if the Prime Directive allows him to be or not. To his defense, Fox doesn't exactly give Kirk much choice, demanding contact with the Emenians so the Federation can set up relations with them which puts the Enterprise in jeopardy...and the Emenians requested the Enterprise don't come to their planet!

Although I had an older sibling who never missed an episode; I was not a fan. Now, well into my middle age, I decided to take a fresh look, to maybe see if I might somehow understand how this series has moved the hearts and minds of countless Trek fans over the decades since. Maybe I thought that even I might be so moved. But, after watching this episode and some 30 odd other episodes before it, I can say with certainty that this will be the last.Science fiction and fantasy, at it's best, touches upon universal themes and can tell old stories from a new perspective, by transcending human or technological limitations and the limitations of time. ""A Taste of Armageddon"" is a caricature of this transcendence. Here, the pompous and utterly sanctimonious Kirk endeavors to end a five centuries war involving hundreds of millions of beings on two planets. People that he has never met and by judging his initial behavior; people he obviously knew very little about. As what always seems to be the case, Kirk uses inanely incredible hand-combat abilities and also his intrepid flair for the game of chicken to save the universe and the SS Enterprise in fifty-one minutes.What is most amazing is that fans of Star Trek have rated this episode as highly as episodes considered among the best. Thus, employing Vulcan logic I would deduce that since this episode was pure tripe, and if it is indeed up to par with the best, a reasonable person such as myself need not watch any further......Painful and annoying, utter garbage.",3

And Kirk forces Anan-7 to face the reality of the situation: ""I've given you back the horrors of war""---not to mention that the prime directive does not apply here.

But the Enterprise soon finds themselves in the middle of a 500 year old war that has ""advanced"" to the point where all warfare is done via computers and members of each society die painless deaths based upon the strategic algorithms of the online chess match being waged. When the crew is asked to sacrifice their lives in the name of the war, Captain Kirk must figure out how to escape from their grasp and put a stop to this madness. I love the concept of this episode: that at some point, we get so technologically advanced and war becomes so dehumanized that it becomes almost palatable and more acceptable to allow it to go on since the main detriment of war (the sufferings of humanity) is no longer involved in the war itself. With this inconvenience out of the way, war is liable to go on for centuries. We never find out what started this war, we never meet or see the opposition, we don't even know why ""peace as impossible"" as Anan 7 continues to tell us. All we know is that this civilization has reached a point where they've dehumanized their wars and disagreements so much they have almost dehumanized themselves. The writers purposefully place all the emphasis on this notion because they do not want to distract us with trifling details. On this planet, war is now the norm and it is structured and orderly. This is a scary thought. As technology improves here on earth with drones and satellites and missiles, we have gotten to the point where we can destroy cities, kill people, wreak havoc without even endangering anyone from whatever side we are on. With the risk of loss of life minimal, the judgments we make relating to military decisions maybe altered. This episode really hits on a nerve here regarding this.The one thing I will quibble with on this episode is the look and speech of the Eminiar. There is nothing differentiating them from your standard North American earthlings. This might be initial on the writers part, forcing us to look into a mirror at our potential selves as a race but I think they should have done something to show the differences between the two species. Anything would have done; a few strange bumps or lines, a weird speech pattern. Oh well... I suppose we are meant to focus on the plot line so it is effective in that regard.I think this is a bit of an overlooked episode that any fan of Star Trek needs to see.",8

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. Unlike any other hit series, it only has 3 seasons so luckily it means that they will be covering up all their ideas within it until they are satisfied. As it often happens, the first season is always promising and has potential (or else it won't lift up for further more seasons) in it and is utilized with fine detailed work like focusing on different new breeds and characters bonding through this journey.After Khan, A Taste Of Armageddon one seems petty and childish as it fails to create the urgency and crisis on the screen resulting into another one of their mundane mission which by now practically they shouldn't be effected with it.",
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" This Side of Paradise (TV Episode 1967)",Personal Impact,"This episode validated Spock's ""half-human"" emotional nature. As a teen, my nickname was ""Spock"". As a fan, I organized a write-in campaign to prevent the original cancellation of Star Trek (unsuccesful). So, when I tell you that Spock kissing the delicately beautiful Jill Irelend caused me no small discomfort in high school, believe it! The effect of the spores could only be overcome by adrenaline (epinephrine). My favorite lines from the show? When questioned as to whether he really is a doctor, McCoy replies: "" Do you want to see how fast I can put you in the hospital?"" My current occupation is- yes- physician!",10
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" This Side of Paradise (TV Episode 1967)",Escaping Your Self-Made Purgatory,"This one really is one of the all-time Trek greats - one of the best episodes of the first season and, for that matter, of the whole three years of the series. It begins as a mystery on a very peaceful planet, where settlers were meant to begin an agricultural colony several years ago. Kirk tries to unravel this odd jigsaw puzzle presented before him in the first act - the colonists should all be dead by this point due to what are known as Berthold Rays and all animals have indeed died off. The answers lie in some funky-looking plants which shoot spores into human beings, thereby indoctrinating them into a space-age version of a 'happiness pill' society. All worries melt away and humans can, for the first time since Adam & Eve (one might say), relax in paradise. In a sense, this is ""The Naked Time"" episode taken to the next level - rather than fighting a form of disease, mankind here seems cured of all ills - there appears to be no reason to escape something so benevolent.There is a beguiling quality to most of this episode and moments of incredible poignancy. Most of these moments are in Spock's scenes, usually with his newfound lady love (the luminous Ireland). Here we see Spock as perhaps he really is without that wall of anti-emotion he projects - this story hints that it really is an artificial wall, even unnecessary. This is not Spock afflicted by sickness or possessed by an alien force - it's the real Spock, smiles and all, all his usual defense mechanisms swept away, as human as, well, Dr. McCoy. Swept Away - that's probably as good a description as any for what happens to him and then the rest of the crew. And ironically, it's most tragic for Spock, among all the crew, when this happiness is taken away - we realize he loses the most here - everyone else just realizes they've been kind of wasting their time. Interestingly, Kirk proves to be the only one resistant to these spores, to a degree. I guess that's why he's captain - it takes a lot more to dissuade him from his mission than it does the average crew member.Overall, this episode presents a superlative progression of surprise, suspense and some jarring thrills following on the heels of the early mystery. After Spock gets through that brief, though alarming, painful transition to his new self, we see Kirk's astonishment as he first observes his transformed first officer (more irony here: Kirk could have really enjoyed a relaxed friendship with Spock if things continued as they were here, a typical 'best friends' relationship, though McCoy might've gotten jealous and then burned off the effect of the spores). Then the ship empties; this was the first time something like this happened - now things look really grim - and once Kirk exits, that's it; the ship will burn up in a decaying orbit. I believe this episode has the shot of the empty bridge which was later used in the TNG episode ""Relics."" Those hints we've seen of Spock's Vulcan strength prove to be quite valid - don't ever anger a Vulcan, especially if you're a frail human. I don't pretend to understand all of Kirk's insults but I think his reference to freakism did the trick. Finally, McCoy gets in the best line towards the end when he tells the colony's leader to make him a mechanic - ""Then I can treat little tin gods like you!"" Priceless.",10

Spock also has one of the most memorable final lines ever. There's also a thrilling scene between Kirk and Spock in the transporter room.I watch this episode when i want to remember that life is short, and artists try to leave memorable culture behind for others to admire. When Spock is first hit by the spores, and he finally responds to Leila (Jill Ireland), she utters these lines of dialogue with Alexander Courage's love scene music playing softly: Leila: Now, now you belong to all of us. And we to you. There's no need to hide your inner face any longer. We understand.This scene still floors me. It always has.In the transporter room Kirk goads Spock into fighting him, breaking his influence from the spores. Minutes later Spock has another unforgettable scene with Leila, and she realizes that she has lost him forever.As the Enterprise departs the planet, heading to a star base, Spock closes out the show with his remark that for the first time he had been happy. Again, this line captivates me no end.This Side of Paradise is another Star Trek episode that puts to shame anything else put on television. I've never encountered television that expressed complex emotional ideas such as this.BTW, the guy who plays Sandoval (Fran Overton) died one month after This Side of Paradise aired! that's a real shame. He didn't get to appreciate this episode by watching it many times, but he certainly was part of a work that has inspired many others.",10

Remarkably, despite the killer radiation, the population is mostly intact and in great health. Just as it is becoming clear how the colony has survived, Kirk is ordered to evacuate all of them.

And the last line of the episode from Spock: ""For the first time in my life, I was happy"".Also, I've begun to think that the difficulties that Spock has with the spores shows why some people become addicted to substances while others don't. Spock finds happiness with the spores, but realizes later that the spores are wrong. Well acted, you can see the mental torture Spock goes through. Very similar to people fighting addictions.Spock's comments about self-made purgatories are especially poignant, beautiful, and moving.An excellent TV episode.",10
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" This Side of Paradise (TV Episode 1967)",Perhaps the best Spock episode,"I really liked this episode even though the plot seemed a bit silly. The Enterprise come to a planet that was settled by a scientific team some time back. They expected to find everyone dead, as they later realized that the planet's atmosphere was lethal--but everyone is very much alive and tremendously happy. They see their dull little planet as a new Eden and they refuse to leave. The reason for this is a strange plant that shoots spores in everyone's face when they come near it. While the spores DO keep you alive, they also make you so content that meaningful existence and work are not possible. Very quickly, all of the members of the landing party are infected and become happy little idiots--even Spock. For a while, Kirk is not hit by the spores, but even when he is, he is somehow above it all because he's the ultra-macho and studly ""JAMES T. KIRK""! His job is to somehow destroy these plants and bring the crew back to the ship--because as of this point, EVERYONE but him has beamed to the planet in search of contentment.I think the reason I liked the episode so much was seeing Spock for the one and only time on the show as a happy, smiling and laughing person!! The ending is especially poignant when Spock waxes lyrical about losing this--a great dramatic moment that will probably bring all the Trekkies close to tears!!

6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" This Side of Paradise (TV Episode 1967)",Spock's little affair with Charles Bronson's wife.,"The best Season 1 episode, and my personal overall favourite. No dull Klingons, no switcheroos, no arrogant and stupid Federation dignitaries, no main characters being ""killed"", no non-descript red-shirts being sent to their doom by Kirk, no absurdly mega-powerful aliens, no court-room scenes, and most importantly: no tiresome and preachy analogies about 20th-century social/political issues. TSOP is almost devoid of ST clichés, containing a perfect balance of sci-fi and lighthearted humour. The humour isn't just ""cute"", as in the fairly entertaining ""The Trouble With Tribbles"", but genuinely funny. The highlights: Spock acting weird over the communicator, Spock telling everyone that ""Kirk is going to be difficult"" (Kirk is ALWAYS ""difficult""), Kirk taunting Spock, and the funniest scene: McCoy threatening to beat up Sandoval. TSOP is cheerful without being overly ""sweet"", it's visually good, with interesting twists. The only logic problem may be the far-fetched premise that somehow Kirk can snap out of it by will alone, whereas no-one else can. And - of course - Kirk had to be the last person to get brainwashed. But there is something intriguing about the prospect of Kirk being stuck alone in the ship, orbiting his zombified crew.It's ironic that D.C. Fontana, a mere secretary on the show, would come up with the best ST script (she wrote the bulk of it). Maybe she should have written more, letting Roddenberry focus on the thing he does best: NOT getting too involved with ST. Gene R. generally wrote the weakest scripts.TSOP offers an interesting dilemma, one the viewer never encounters again: who does one root for, the plants or Kirk? I.e. Free Will or heavenly bliss. Nimoy delivers one of his best performances, very convincingly showing Spock's obvious disappointment at having been jerked out of paradise...",

Spock gets hit with the spores and his human-half ignites the flames for an old ""interest"" who lives in the community, played by Jill Ireland(Charles Bronson's former wife).

8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" This Side of Paradise (TV Episode 1967)",Why leave?,"This episode reminds me of Aldous Huxley's ""A Brave New World."" I read the book before I saw this episode. Huxley's book had a profound impact on me, and this episode had essentially the same message - perfect happiness and utopia is inhuman and bad, and human flaws with struggle and pain is good. My philosophy has always been that happiness is the ultimate goal. If one is delusional or whatever, what does it matter if one is happy? Isn't happiness everyone's goal. It would seem not if you took the message from Huxley's novel and this episode. It would seem that the right answer is that to be flawed is human and one should embrace that, whether that mean war, starvation, misery, or whatever. The message is that it is better to be under one's own faculties than under the influence of a lie, even if that lie leads us exactly where we all want to go. I say, if we are unaware of the lie, then it does not matter. I can see the argument for why it would be bad. The argument is that it isn't possible, and I get that. But in Huxley's novel and this episode, it is possible, yet it is still purported to be a bad thing. It is as if something is lost in the human experience if the negative side of life cannot be experienced, though we all strive to avoid that side.I am much like Spock, a bit autistic and logical. I really empathize with Spock when he states that this is the only time he knew happiness, and I wonder why he did not strive to return to it. To be completely free of what hindered him from enjoying life; to know what that felt like and abandon it truly asks for a serious philosophical discussion. I would not have made that decision. I would have returned to the bliss.People question why Kirk was the only one that didn't succumb, and to me it is because he is the ideal human. For him, normal human life is extremely rewarding. He is a winner. For him to succeed when others fail is what drives him. It would be unthinkable that there are no winners or losers and that everything is just dandy the way it is. He cannot function like this. I think this is a very American view of the world; very individualistic; there must be winners and losers, pain and triumph. We are told that we have to be a certain way, but that is just brainwashing to get us to comply and fill our role in society. It is what the ideal man wants for the rest of us. They don't want us to have bliss and happiness and not produce anything for them to feed their ego. They want us to be enslaved to them. Stories like this tell you that if you are ignorant of greed and the desire to be something better that you are living a worthless life. Marijuana was banned in the 60s not because it was unhealthy. It was banned because there was a concern that we would be turned into a country of do-nothings that were satisfied with basic needs. While I relate to wanting to live in such a way, I understand that ultimately, a nation of do-nothings is harmful, however when such a model could be produced such as in this episode to where there were no negative consequences from such a lifestyle, why not choose it?For someone like Spock, he doesn't know true social happiness, and to find it is truly a gift. My guess is that without the influence of the spores that Spock succumbed to his loyalty to Kirk and the mission because that is what he is programmed to do. But for me, the human side of me, the non-autistic side, yearns to be blissfully unaware as most human beings are. I am too tuned in, and to be this tuned out would truly be something that I would not give up. I am a psychiatrist and find these sort of possibilities of the imagination most intriguing.",8
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" This Side of Paradise (TV Episode 1967)",Particularly poignant today...,"Just the other day, as I have on many other days of late, I ventured back in Time to revisit the adventures of Kirk and Spock and McCoy. No, I haven't discovered how to hitch a ride to tachyons into the Past: I simply took out my DVD set of STAR TREK- THE ORIGINAL SERIES and spent some quality time with the original crew of the Enterprise. One of the episodes I chose was THIS one, because it gave fans a rare glimpse into the ""other"" side of the stoic Science Officer- the Human Side. Leonard Nimoy was capable of great Depth when the opportunity presented itself, and this particular episode of this particular series stands as a Lasting Tribute to the Man who played the Vulcan. If, as has been suggested, Energy never dissipates, he's still Out There, Somewhere, in some New Form- waiting for us to join him.",10
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" This Side of Paradise (TV Episode 1967)",Remember Odysseus and the Lotus Eaters,"Kirk and Spock find themselves on a planet where no living thing should exist. In contrast, there seems to be vegetation and a thriving population. There is another surprise. A beautiful young woman played by Jill Ireland, who once had a thing for Spock, is on the planet. Also, on the planet is a sort of flower that when approached, fires spores, causing a sense of utter euphoria in the recipient. Most of the crew are infected with these spores which causes them to loll around, forgetting their duties. Spock, though initially traumatized, falls in with the rest. He picks up his romance with the young woman and announces that he has never been happy before. His deep human side is being exposed. Soon Kirk, who has somehow avoided the spores, is the only one left on the Enterprise. He can't possibly manage the ship by itself and the crew is unwilling to have anything to do with assisting him. He is bewildered but doesn't know what to do. Fortunately, as luck would have it, McCoy has brought some of the flowers on board and Kirk is dispatched by one of them. This leads to the solution to the problem. In some ways this is quite sad because of Spock's experience with love and the loss of it. The positive is that we get to see Leonard Nimoy stretch himself a bit, not playing the stolid Vulcan all the time.",8
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" This Side of Paradise (TV Episode 1967)",Spock on acid - what is next??,"""This Side of Paradise"" was quite a daring episode for the times. The plot about spore plants that can alter a person's who character, closely resembles that of being high on acid.
The sight of Spock dangling from a tree just about says it all!
Jill Ireland is her usual self here - absolutely dreadful!! Whoever said she could act must have been thinking of a blonde statue. Bette Davis she isn't.
The tension is cranked up during the physical altercation between Kirk and Spock. It's not usually a smart move in winding up a Vulcan but Kirk had his reasons.
I love this episode.",10

13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" This Side of Paradise (TV Episode 1967)",Potent and bittersweet,"Like most older Star Trek fans, I am well familiar with this episode, although I hadn't seen it in many years. I remembered it mostly for having a saccharine feel to it. I've got to say that, in re-watching it just recently at a much older age, the episode was well-written for the most part and better than I remembered it. Rather than saccharine, I realize the more appropriate way to describe this episode is bittersweet, especially for Mr. Spock, and it leaves a lasting resonance.This was quite a good episode for the most part, which echoes themes from ""The Cage"": humans were not meant to stagnate; they must struggle to advance. Indeed, the episode is a potent metaphor for the dangers of opiate abuse: an opiate abuser can be quite content, so long as the opiates are in plentiful supply, but will basically waste his or her life if left to that lifestyle.There was one bit of bad writing: Spock's comment to Leilani that a happiness drug is ""not scientifically possible."" Sheesh, what an unscientific thing to say (it's an empirical question, after all), as well as totally inaccurate: mind-altering drugs have been around since the dawn of humankind! Psychopharmacology is a massive scientific study unto itself and has been for decades.While Kirk undoubtedly made the right decisions here, one can't help but feel a little sorry for Spock. This was the one situation where he could be happy, but he must walk away from it. Fine performance by a young Jill Ireland as the love interest.",8
14,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" This Side of Paradise (TV Episode 1967)",Spock Finds Happiness,"In ""This Side of Paradise"", the Enterprise visits a colony that us presumed dead. The colony was set up on a planet subject to Berthold Rays, a dangerous emission that has only recently been discovered to be lethal under prolonged exposure. When the crew arrives, they are surprised to find that the colonists are not only alive but in perfect health! Strangely, all animal life has perished. A native plant has intoxicated the crew, leaving them in a euphoric state of bliss and oneness. The plant soon spreads this through the entire crew. The only one not affected by it is Captain Kirk. Spock succumbs to the plants and reunites with an old flame. The entire crew deserts him and he must figure out a way to get everyone to snap out it. He discovers that raw emotions like anger undo the pheromones and he riles up Spock enough to brawl with him and come back to being good ole Spock. They eventually turn the rest of the crew and colonists and leave the planet for good.Thus felt to me like a bit of an allegory on drug use and the flower power movement of the time. You're got this blissful disposition but as a society you stagnate. You bury your emotions in a drug that will only give you faux happiness. Is that really living?Maybe I'm misreading it but I did enjoy the episode. Spock's arc in this one is heartbreaking, especially the final line of how he was happy for the first time in his life. Poor guy... Bones' transformation into a Southern gentleman was kind of odd. It was humorous at first but grinded on me a but as the episode wore on. For once he wasn't being a total jerk to Spock though so that's nice. We never get an explanation as to why Kirk is the only person unaffected by the spores. Does he have more internal rage rippling under the surface than everyone else? Is it something in his DNA? Regardless, I would have enjoyed an answer. Another solid entry from Season 1, I think this does a lot to develop Spock as a character, showing us the emotions he must keep a lid on. I definitely feel for him in this one.",8
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" This Side of Paradise (TV Episode 1967)",Wish Spock could have stayed!!!,"Great episode, really enjoyed seeing Spock act human and in love and not subservient to Kirk. Spock's line ""the first time in my life I was happy"" was so sad, I wish he could have said something about the incident that didn't make me feel so bad!! Negatives - spore-emitting flowers even cheesier-than-average special effect. And Kirk has Samsonite luggage, how retro lol!!",10
16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" This Side of Paradise (TV Episode 1967)","""Man stagnates if he has no ambition"".","Though the story is ultimately a good one, there are an awful lot of elements over the course of the episode that don't make sense to me. For starters, there's Kirk's decision to bring an unprotected landing party of six to the surface of Omicron Ceti III, even while knowing that Berthold rays disintegrate living animal tissue. That detail is glossed over by Spock's mention that it would take seven days for Berthold rays to begin to affect humans, but still, why not take the precaution? I thought that was weak.Later an observation is made by the Enterprise crew that the agricultural colony was not producing more food than was needed by the colonists themselves, as if that was a negative. My response to that is, what would be the point? What would they have done with the over-production? It's not like they could have traded their food with another settlement doing the exact same thing. That just didn't make sense.Then there's the scene between Spock and Leila (Jill Ireland) right after Spock gets hit with the spores. In the subsequent scene, Spock is wearing the brown coverall uniform of the Omicrons. Where did he get it from? It's not likely that they would have stopped a moment to marvel at Spock's transformation long enough to go back to the settlement for a change of wardrobe.But the best, and seriously, I had to laugh - Why would Captain Kirk have a suitcase in his quarters on the Enterprise? A suitcase??? The whole idea of that cracked me up so much that I'm laughing again even as I write this.Well I guess I've panned this episode enough, There's some good stuff here, just as there was in the very prior episode - 'A Taste of Armageddon'. Both tell essentially the same story from diametrically opposite angles. In 'Armageddon', the leaders of Eminiar VII have surrendered their authority to a mathematically constructed computer game in order to minimize destructive conflicts. Citizens live in peace but willingly surrender their lives when a computer tells them it's time to do so. On Omicron Ceti III, the settlers live in complete peace and comfort, but with no ambition to create progress and further the advance of their community or civilization. With no wants or needs, the community stagnates, causing it's leader Sandoval (Frank Overton) to question their very purpose once the effects of the spores is counteracted.Like other reviewers on this board, I also question what made Kirk so immune from the effects of the spores. You might add that puzzler to my earlier list of quirks for this episode. I can go along with the idea that strong emotions countered the effects of the spores, but the Captain was no more suited to be unaffected by them than was Spock, given the way their characters had been developed by the series up till now. Also convenient as well, that Spock was affected by something the same way as humans here, while in other situations he wasn't. Not finding fault mind you, just making another observation.",8
17,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" This Side of Paradise (TV Episode 1967)","""We weren't meant for paradise...""","Says Captain James T. Kirk. Truth be told I'm not sure that this is the episode in which he makes this statement, but even it it isn't the summation is apt.A colony is bereft of want or desire, other than to frolic. While all the time their animals and works have decayed and died off. Partially because of the deadly environment, but partially because of an outside influence.Which would you have, a paradise where all your carnal and emotional amusements were satisfied at the cost of everything you spent your previous life building, or a life where your work and struggles were rewarded? Does the heir of a fortunate fare better than the child born on the wrong side of the tracks who makes good through academic and/or physical effort?The gist of the story is clear. But the truth of the parable is actually a more sophisticated one, the true depths of which are not addressed in this brief photoplay. But, what we do see is a commentary on the overindulgence of the 1960's new-youth oriented social movements, and the consequences of excess to the exclusion of all else in a social structure where achievement is discouraged. In this sense we're also seeing the segment of a rehabilitative asylum, satiating a patient's alleged unhealthy wants and desires to ""get it out of their system"", so to speak.What truly is paradise? What is truly hell? This episode (and a couple others in the franchise) attempt to address facets of both sides of the coin through the presentation of dramatic scenarios for our pleasure.Again, Star Fleet's finest meet the challenge, albeit in an unusual way.In terms of production values ... well, the plants are what they are, and there's no two ways about it. But the acting, story and theme are first rate, particularly by Nimoy's stretching of Spock's boundaries. Great stuff. And Shatner's Kirk is of course the lynch pin to the entire thing. The Enterprise herself looks fantastic in her 1960 glory as she glides across the screen of Omicron Ceti III, even if somewhat dated.The key ""antagonist"" may garnish a chuckle from younger viewers, and appropriately so. Heck, even when the show first aired people were in a ""awe, come on"" mode when the ""spores hit-the-fan"", so to speak :)Regardless, watch this episode to see the crew of our favorite starship get pushed to their limits and beyond.Enjoy :)p.s. We're actually watching a man (Spock and the crew of the Entperise) recover from bi-polar disorder. A clever gimmicky use of abnormal psychology in a sci-fi vein. In the end Spock releases his temper and recovers.p.s. in retrospect it is about recovering from depression and bi-polar. I only wish the plants had been tweaked or turned into something else.",

It features a smiling and laughing Spock, not fighting his inner feelings for once. I love that the first thing he says to his lady friend after he has accepted the effect of the plant's spores is ""I love you."" It's not so much that he FALLS in love as he is ABLE to express that love, which before this was locked away. He appears genuinely happy, and his relationship with Jill Ireland's character seems warm and real.You know that this loosening effect on Spock and crew is temporary, so watch and enjoy while it lasts.

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. Unlike any other hit series, it only has 3 seasons so luckily it means that they will be covering up all their ideas within it until they are satisfied. As it often happens, the first season is always promising and has potential (or else it won't lift up for further more seasons) in it and is utilized with fine detailed work like focusing on different new breeds and characters bonding through this journey.This Side Of Paradise had a new concept and a new angle where the characters weren't at their natural state which always is intriguing enough to watch especially if it is written brilliantly and strikes down some of the fan boy moments.",

Instead, he is captivated by a gorgeous blonde whose features are ""highlighted"" by special effects. Soon we see him acting like an 18 year old boy, swinging from a tree, and in love for the first time. Well worth seeing if only for these scenes, and McCoy is also charming with his souped-up Georgia accent, sipping on a Mint Julep. The Captain soon figures out a remedy and before long, after a fist fight with Spock,all are returned to their usual state. The only complaint is that these types of episodes are getting repetitive in Season One, where Starfleet personnel are again taken over by forces outside their control and start behaving out of character. It ends on a sad note where Spock says this is the only time he has ever been ""happy"". Even so, a very good episode, and of course we love seeing Spock smiling and kissing a woman.",8

Surprisingly objections come from a surprising quarter Spock states that he is staying with the colonists! It turns out that people are effected by spores from a local plant that leaves people feeling mellow with a strong desire to remain near the flowers. Kirk is naturally angered and only gets more frustrated as more and more members of the landing party are effected. When Dr McCoy beams some of the plants to the Enterprise Kirk becomes the only crew member unaffected. If he is to keep his crew together he will have to figure out why he was unaffected so he can 'cure' them.This episode is a classic thanks to the way we get to see the emotional side of the usually emotionless Mr Spock. Leonard Nimoy does a fine job showing how the character reacts to gaining emotions and poignantly losing them again; as he observes that for the first time he'd felt happiness. It was nice to see Spock not only happy but in love with one of the colonists, played by Jill Ireland. The plants are clearly a metaphor for psychotropic drugs with the colonists feeling happy till they are free of the plants' effects when they realise the meaninglessness of the lives they've lived although given they were happy and healthy it didn't seem so bad!",8

However, when Kirk, Spock, Sulu, McCoy, and away team beam down to the planet, Omicrom, they notice that the colonists (who left earth for this planet), who should be by all accounts dead, are alive and perfectly healthy! McCoy does exams on the colonists, even realizing that surgeries removing appendix and showing scars are totally healed! What is the reason behind this? Well, Spock sure finds out when someone he meets from six years prior, still madly in love with him, introduces him to flowers that release spores, influencing anyone who absorbs them at close range. His emotional control barrier is broken down, allowing Spock to be free to smile, to be silly, to love. Jill Ireland (wife of Chuck Bronson) was the love interest for Spock, who admits at the very end that for the first time in his life, he was happy. The episode is a bit sappy with its romantic subplot (the music when Nimoy and Ireland are together is gag-inducing for those like me who just aren't into lovey-dovey) but seeing Spock swinging from a tree, disobeying Kirk's orders flippantly while smooching Ireland, and revealing a side to him that was behind a protected wall due to the Vulcan repression of emotion provide plentiful entertainment value. My favorite scene is definitely Kirk on the Enterprise by himself, with a flower dumping spores into his face, with him combating their influence through anger. The crew just disregarding their captain who is ordering them to go back to their stations as they beam themselves down to the planet is a hoot. You can see how helpless Kirk feels. McCoy laying on a Georgia accent real thick, with ""good ole Jim-boy"" banter towards Kirk is priceless. Ireland is absolutely beautiful. The location is sunny and vibrant, although Kirk realizes it is all a façade. The colony has done nothing but live in a fog of good health and joy (kind of a pleasant alternative to what Kirk believes shouldn't be so easy; many would prefer Omicron any day of the week compared to the struggles we so often face in life), having done little agriculturally besides raise vegetables. Kirk having to land a barrage of insults at Spock in order to get him really violently mad so the spores leave his system is a memorable scene. It had gotten so bad for Kirk, Uhura, under the spores influence, had short-circuited distance subspace communication, with only ""to surface"" lines open. Although the script makes a point about how living in total harmony but stagnant without any progression is wrong, there could be a debate right the opposite: why not accept spores enabling you to not feel anything but pleasure and happiness with perfect health against the alternative of cancer, misery, and aging?",5
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Devil in the Dark (TV Episode 1967)",That's No Devil - That's a Horta!,"I sympathized with the plight of the first man, Schmitter, we see killed in this episode. He reminded me of the trepidation associated with being a lone security guard at night somewhere - the type of work I did briefly about 20 years ago. Of course, I was never in danger of being burned to a crisp, as the colony chief (Lynch) is fond of describing. The monster in the dark here, murdering members of a deep mining colony, creates a scary impression in the first act. We don't really see it in the early scenes and, as many of us realize, the best monsters are sometimes left to the imagination. 'Big and shaggy' is one voiced description, but it actually turns out to resemble a big, lumpy pepperoni pizza, skittering along the ground like a silicon centipede - a limitation of the show's budget, unfortunately. This also shows in the latest matte painting, famous to Trek fans, the only way to convey a long shot of the mining operations.But, the whole theme of this episode is about what's on the inside, rather than outward appearances, anyway. Sure, this Horta, a newly-discovered silicon-based life-form, looks like a mindless monster at first glance. Thanks to Spock's telepathic ability (probably the best use of a Vulcan mind meld for plot purposes), we learn it's a highly intelligent, even sophisticated creature. Besides Spock's instrumental use of his talent, McCoy gets to supersede his usual medical routine - healing a creature resembling rocks or asbestos. He also gets to utter one of his most famous lines, ""I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer!"" I found it very true-to-life in his scene where he exults in his success, though he's unable to get Kirk to share in his enthusiasm - Kirk's too busy organizing results. The episode throws unexpected turns in character & motivation at the audience as the story progresses; Spock champions the need to possibly preserve this discovered life as Kirk takes his usual stand on preventing the deaths of any red-shirts (no half measures, as in ""The Man Trap""). But later, it's Kirk who, for some reason, holds back on firing a killing blast, as if the heat of the hunt had worn off and he'd had time to reflect on Spock's point (I believe it was during this episode's filming that Shatner learned his father had died). Uncharacteristic for most of the first season, this has a happy ending. The conflict stems from the needs of basic capitalism, such as meeting standard quotas, versus protecting the natural environment and its inhabitants - a space age version of protecting owls from the tractors of modern advancement. Somehow, despite many killings and a sense that everything could go to hell at any moment with one raised phaser, Kirk and Spock manage to broker an agreement which satisfies everyone. I guess people and silicates are more reasonable in the 23rd century.",8
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Devil in the Dark (TV Episode 1967)",Still a favorite after all these years,"Kirk and the crew are visiting a federation mining colony on a remote planet rich in mineral resources. The Devil in the Dark is the Horta, a very unusual silicon based life-form which tunnels through solid rock. The Horta has been killing miners and, it is decided, must be destroyed. But how? It is hard to continue this review without writing a spoiler, so instead I simply concentrate on the technical aspects of the episode and touch on its themes. The special effects are OK, but many of the scenes with the Horta look a little absurd. The acting is fairly average for TOS. Some of the miners are a little awkward. Nimoy has the most difficult role of all in Devil in the Dark, and he pulls it off well. Why is this still a favorite of mine?Devil in the Dark is really an anthropological and ecological morality play disguised as an adventure. More than many episodes of this great TV series, it brings home the importance of maintaining an open mind and at least some degree of empathy toward others. Plus, it involves one of the most interesting, if not probable, plot twists in the original series. Enjoy!",8
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Devil in the Dark (TV Episode 1967)","""I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer""!","Well now, I've seen some cheesy looking monsters in my time. Most of them came from 1959 'Z' grade sci-fi flicks like ""Attack of the Giant Leeches"", ""The Giant Gila Monster"" and that real scary lobster silhouette in ""Teenagers From Outer Space"". But this Horta just takes the cake. Seriously, what were they thinking when they came up with this design?Yet on another level, this episode does a nice job of exploring the unknown and presenting the Enterprise crew with a choice to react with animal instinct or take a more systematic approach to find out what was happening on Janus VII. Captain Kirk is particularly effective here in the way he comes to the side of the Horta. But I would like to know what Shatner and Nimoy were REALLY thinking when Spock went into that Vulcan mind meld on the creature. Is there a Star Trek outtakes reel?Then there's Bones - 'Yeah, you heard me, beam me down a hundred pounds of concrete and a trowel. I've got work to do'. I have to say, that was actually a quite creative resolution to the story of an injured crawling rock and her unhatched brood. I don't believe that whole fibrous asbestos/silicon based life form idea was ever used before or since. You have to hand it to Roddenberry and his writers here, they boldly went and never looked back with this one.",7
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Devil in the Dark (TV Episode 1967)",True Roddenberry,"Of all the episodes of all series, this one holds the closest to Roddenberry's original tenet. According to the book THE MAKING OF STAR TREK, in Roddenberry's writer's guide to his story writers, he states that any alien creature, no matter how hideously ugly, impossible to believe, benign or malicious, MUST hold some semblance of humanity that the TV viewing public can empathize with and/or relate to. Devil In The Dark's HORTA, which resembles nothing more or less than a large blob of cow dung, is a mother protecting her babies, those ball-shaped silicon nodules the miners keep finding throughout the mine passages and destroying, because they have no idea what they are! This is one of my absolute favorite episodes if only for that!",10
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Devil in the Dark (TV Episode 1967)",A fine episode,"I thought this was one of the best episodes of the first season. Curiously, Spock is the one, not McCoy, who is the most compassionate and concerned about life, here, at least initially, although Kirk ends up being the one who pushes hardest for communication and a peaceful resolution to the conflict. It seemed a bit odd to give McCoy the job of healing the creature near the end-- it seems like that would be a job better left to an engineer like Mr. Scott, since it was more an issue of materials science than medicine; but I guess they had to give McCoy some important task to do.Unlike some of the early episodes, this one did not feel padded; the pacing worked very well, with a real and serious threat (hostile life form, immune to standard phaser fire), a significant practical problem (the halting of mining operations critical to many Federation planets), and a careful investigation coordinated by Kirk. I'm also glad that the miners were portrayed fairly sympathetically; once they realize what they've done, they feel remorse and are motivated to make amends.The episode was also a fascinating early example of environmentalist concerns: industrial activity that threatened to destroy a native creature and its natural habitat. Here, the solution worked out quite nicely for everyone, unlike the 'real world' where, more often than not, there are definite 'winners' and 'losers' economically, when environmental issues are involved. One could argue that protecting the environment is better for everyone in the long run; but someone whose livelihood is at stake might not see it that way, which is understandable enough.",8
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Devil in the Dark (TV Episode 1967)","""The devil in the dark"" is still my favourite episode!","This may not be the most exiting or incredible episode they've made, but in my opinion it remains as one of Star Trek and the Sci-Fi genre's most original episodes. Most ideas from retro Sci-Fi series especially including Star Trek has been reused several times, this one the other hand remains mostly as a one time triumph. This among the episodes that impressed me the most towards the end.Another thing I like with this episode is how it has accomplished to create such and exiting and captivating story with such few special affects. Now without criticizing the episode I must admit the effects are very dated, but then again what can you expect from a TV show from 1967? But still the creature (""Horta"") in this episode is basically just a carpet with some coloured rubber on it. Yet you forget this after about 1 minute and you only start thinking about it as what it's supposed to be. Also the caves don't exactly look like rock, but again you forget it after a few minutes. This episode is a living proof on how good acting and a good story, can make you ignore the visual effects.The acting from the main cast is as usual great. This episode features the series second mind meld by Spock and is one of my favourites. So to say it simple Leonard Nimoy is definitely a scene stealer here, and his acting is excellent. Not that Kirk or Bones don't get their share of the episode but Spock is the most intriguing in this one. i like the fact that the episode is not about one specific character but evolves around the trio handling an alien problem. Also it's nice to see an episode who doesn't only happen on the Enterprise.Like most Star Trek episodes this episode tells us to have an open mind. I won't spoil the story, but evolves around what in the start seems like a typical monster story. It has killed several humans and therefore must be killed. But is that really all there is to it? I can assure you that the explanation in the end, will not disappoint you. This is still my favourite Star Trek TOS episode and i give it a 10/10.",10
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Devil in the Dark (TV Episode 1967)",The Devil in the Dark,"Loose within a cavernous location is a creature that attacks scientists, burning them ""to a crisp"". The Enterprise is commissioned to go to the planet and find out what it is that has killed over 50 men and why. Janus 6 is the name for the planet and a long-existing mining colony is present, their personnel those who have fallen victim to the mysterious creature. Once Kirk, Spock, and McCoy beam down to the planet, the creature actually ""steals"" a main circulating pump which provides life support, heating, and other life-sustaining functions for the mining colony so it seems that they're dealing with a smart alien life form, not just some primeval killing machine. Without a circulating pump in the power reactor, it will go ""super critical"" leading to a radioactive catastrophe. Spock gives it some thought and considers the possibility of a silicon-based life form with such a hard outer shell it could withstand the blast from phaser1 (the only kind of phasers used on the Janus colony planet by personnel) although Bones scoffs at such a staggering diagnosis since a silicon life form has always been seen as physiologically impossible. Why would the life form steal such a much-needed device from the colony, killing the personnel, after no activity towards them for fifty years? It might have something to do with thousands of ""silicon nodules"" found spread throughout the cavernous tunnels made by the acidic, corrosive secretions from the fast-moving bulky creature. Spock, through intense tri-corder readings, believes that this silicon creature could be the last of its kind and killing it would be a crime against science.With a cheesy looking monster (right out of ""The Creeping Terror"" and those of its ilk) and sets (the cavernous setting looks really cheap, but that's par for the course during this era of television sci-fi before sophisticated effects and sets), ""The Devil in the Dark"" could've easily had been one of those campy, easily mocked episodes of Star Trek, but thanks to a strong script and intriguing ideas it goes in a thoroughly pleasant direction, with some fascinating developments (this episode asks us who really is the monster, the Horta or the miners; not to mention, the end result when a proposition is offered to settle the differences between the Horta and the miners) providing us with a creature (named the Horta) that isn't just a rampaging killing machine but has reasons for its actions. This episode features a Vulcan mind meld which provides a ""meeting of the minds"" allowing Kirk to know what the Horta is feeling/thinking, as well as, the hilarious line by Spock after Kirk claims he's becoming more human all the time: ""Captain I see no reason to stand here and be insulted."" How McCoy attends to a serious wound on the Horta is also quite a remarkable feat as is Scotty's engineering magic keeping the reactor going with bits of throwaway parts. While not one of my personal favorites of the series, I understand why so many have such high regard for ""The Devil in the Dark"" and I furthermore like that the title may not necessarily refer to the Horta.""I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer.""",8

I remember someone had taken some electrical tape and spelled out on the floor in the foyer at the convention entrance ""NO KILL I"".The homage paid by this act reflects the importance of the social trend and awareness happening at the time. The country (the western world in fact) had just come off of one social upheaval in the midst of the Cold War, and was entering another. Trek was ahead of the curve by telling another great parable regarding not just a conservationist message, not just an environmental message, but one that levels a finger at mankind in his treatment of other living creatures.This episode hits empathetic folks on a gut level. My mother included (or especially I should say), for while watching this episode with me (one of the few times she and I watched Trek together) she sternly agreed with Captain Kirk when Shatner's character berates Jarvis for the wanton and irresponsible acts of destruction.It's not just a warning for today's companies and their forefathers, however still relevant and timely. It's more than that. It's a future warning to mankind, and any sentient who would mindlessly exploit that of which they knew nothing.Another review comments on the thesping by Shatner and Nimoy. I agree that it's high caliber. The matte painting of the mining facility is what it is, as is the Horta itself. It is, after all, 1960's sci-fi TV. Even so, I'm hard pressed to find better props used in today's TV offerings (part of the reason I don't watch too much contemporary television anymore). Good shots, good dialog, good story, and a profound theme.Enjoy.",

Or in this case, a monster, one who's terrorizing the grunts in a mining colony. It's an extermination mission and that episode-long buildup is how the creature takes on a life of its own, no matter the level of production values. And it's a story of hard-won tolerance, thanks to that twist ending.But it's also a good showcase for the Kirk-Spock-McCoy relationship. Isolated from the rest of the crew, this mystery is left to them to solve. All kidding aside, it's a great episode all around.8/10",8
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Devil in the Dark (TV Episode 1967)",A new form of life,The Enterprise is called in to help when a mysterious creature starts killing members of a mining colony. The colony is extracting essential minerals but its existence is threatened by the creature; especially when it takes a vital part of their reactor's cooling mechanism; proving that it is intelligent. After seeing how the creature moves through solid rock and fails to register on any scanners Spock speculates that unlike every other known lifeform this creature is based on silicon rather than carbon. Applying this theory they recalibrate their instruments and discover that there is a single silicon based lifeform in the vicinity of the mine. Phasers have limited effect on it but Spock and Kirk eventually manage to wound it. Eventually the creature is cornered and Spock attempts a mind-meld leading to him learning about the nature of the creature and why it has been attacking the miners.This is a classic Star Trek episode; it explores the idea that there may be non-carbon based lifeforms and raises some environmental issues. The creature effects may be laughable by today's standards but that doesn't spoil the story and it avoids the cliché of having a humanoid lifeform. Leonard Nimoy puts in a good performance as Spock; especially in the mind-meld scene. While this is a fairly dramatic episode there are some good moments of humour; most notably when Dr McCoy is asked to treat the creature's phaser wound. Overall a quality episode that I'm sure most fans of the series will enjoy.,9

Life may not look anything like it does on earth and it may not even function bodily as we do on earth. But life can be found in the strangest of places. Consider this planet which looks to be made of solid rock, yet something is killing off the miners in Ken Lynch's crew. Which is why he sent a distress call and the Enterprise responds.Lynch's men are not being killed, in fact they're being burned to a crisp. It's being done by a creature we learn calls itself a Horta and to our eyes it's not aesthetically pleasing. This Star Trek story reduces life to a problem of communication. The Horta has a very good reason for doing what it does.It's a good moral this story has, all we need in the Universe is better communication.",8

It still gave me nightmares at age 10.I also didn't like this episode much as a kid because we hardly see the Enterprise, and how can that be Star Trek? Eventually I learned that good science fiction, like all drama, is about characters and ideas, not sets and costumes and special effects. And so ""Devil in the Dark"" is now one of my favorite Star Trek episodes.I sometimes wonder if it was done as penance for ""The Man Trap"". That episode also featured an intelligent creature, native to the planet and the last of its species, who began murdering humans for no apparent reason. But that episode doesn't fit the Star Trek philosophy at all, while this one is among the very best examples of that philosophy in action.",10

Upon arrival they met with Chief Engineer Vanderberg who tells them what has been going on in more detail. The search begins for this creature that can kill a person with a strong corrosive substance. The crew learn that the miners have found seemly useless silicon nodules and the creature is a silicone based lifeform. Kirk and Spock search for the creature while McCoy beams back up to the ship. Kirk and Spock find the creature hurt and Spock conducts a Vulcan mind-meld with it to learn more about it - it is called a Horta. McCoy is called back down later to help this unusual patient while the miners are ready to destroy it.An episode that is hard to forget. I used to describe the Horta as a bubbly burnt pizza-like creature but watching it again all these years later I would say it looks more like a meatball with sauce on it. That's OK though because the Horta thinks that humans are hideous looking but the Vulcan is pleasant looking to it. lol.7/10",7

Kirk's character arc is strongest of all here,it's no surprise to find that Shatener regards it as one of the best,and indeed, his ""first to touch her,dies"" moment is my favorite moment in all TV,it shows how compassion and common sense can win the argument,just brilliant.",

Although its motives and emotions are conveyed through the always capable Leonard Nimoy, the Horta still sorta comes across as a likable enough critter (the fact that it's a mother-to-be may have something to do with this: she kills only because she's given no other choice). It's our own knee-jerk reaction(s) to its appearance (and the appearance of its young) that results in loss of life; when contact is established, things work out smoothly enough. A very pro-lifeform episode. (It also inspired a short story by Yours Truly, THE HEART OF THE MATTER.)",10

There are also very few character--and most of the time it's just Kirk and Spock mucking about in the dark. Because of this the episode seems claustrophobic and static. There, they encounter a weird creature named the Horta and Spock makes some sort of love connection with it using his mind meld.This is one of the higher-rated episodes of the first season of Star Trek and I must be one of the dissenters. I really have no idea why others have embraced this mediocre episode--I noticed nothing particularly memorable about it--though perhaps some environmentalists were excited by the ""save the species"" aspects of the film. The plot is just okay, the dialog isn't particularly interesting and the creature looks pretty silly! In fact, when I see the Horta moving about, I can't help but think about some kids or dwarf underneath it trying to make the monster look scary! Yeah, sure.",5

As the miners continue drilling deeper, it seems to be upsetting the monster more and more. Spock soon discerns that the monster is silicon-based, not the type of lifeform that the crew is familiar with! It turns out that the miners have stumbled across the last of the Horta as she attempts to protect her batch of eggs, killing the miners in self-defense. Spock and Kirk ask the miners to coexist with the lifeform in a symbiotic relationship.The plot of ""don't judge a beast by its cover"" has been around since at least when Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein but this is a fun retelling of it. At the beginning, everyone abhors the Horta; they fear it, loathe it. But Spock's mindmeld and Kirk's understanding soon changes this tune for everyone. People are often afraid of what they don't understand. This episode reveals to us that, if we hope to find peace with what we don't understand or take issuance with, the first step is communication.I love Spock's playful side. It's at full force in the closing scene as he compliments himself through the interpretation of the Horta. I think it perfectly encapsulates his character. Another fine episode!",8

They suspect alternate life forms and start investigating the possibilities.This is a great episode highlighting Mr Spock's metaphysical talents and the human value system that makes the series interesting to watch. To add some spice, Spock and Kirk spar a little about whether to kill the creature.The worst part is probably the appearance of the creature herself, who looks a lot like a bad broccoli casserole circa 1967.Otherwise, good show.",9

A terrible ""monster suit!""","The ""monster"" in this case, is man, as nuclear miners unknowingly destroy hundreds of eggs from the burrowing monster called a ""Horta"". It resembles both a peperoni pizza and a plate of spaghetti and meatballs with yellow cheese poured over it. It obviously has a stuntman inside of it, creeping along. A good sci-fi concept somewhat made somewhat laughable by a really ""cheesy-looking"" rubber suit! Spock does a mind-meld with it and Dr. MCCoy repairs its mortal wounds with silicon patching cement! Not as bad as it sounds, but unintentionally funny to me. The Horta finds the appearance of man as revolting as its appearance is to us. The miners will now live in peace as the Horta and its millions of babies will now burrow mining tunnels instead of killing the miners with its corrosive acid. Too bad the budget wasn't bigger.

It was the type that left a lasting impression good or bad who can say, it was kinda of scary when I first saw it in the 60's or 70's. The show can sort of suck you in even though it is cheesy by current standards. Sure the Horta looks like an mutant supreme pizza with the Italian sausage, pepperoni, and lots of cheese. The sound effects of the monster in the first encounter are reminiscent of the life status monitor in sick bay. The philosophical arguments are there but don't overwhelm the entertainment value of the show, more of a subplot. The script and acting aren't that bad for the mid 1960's. The eggs are closer to a pearl than an egg, but it is a silicon based life form so what do you expect (regarding a previous reviewers comments). I was surprised to hear that Phasers had a silicon setting, it was convenient though ineffective even on maximum. Funny thing was Spock could mind meld it by touching it but it burned its way through the rock as we walk through the air. The Doctor healing the Horta with 100 pounds of thermal concrete was cute.

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. Unlike any other hit series, it only has 3 seasons so luckily it means that they will be covering up all their ideas within it until they are satisfied. As it often happens, the first season is always promising and has potential (or else it won't lift up for further more seasons) in it and is utilized with fine detailed work like focusing on different new breeds and characters bonding through this journey.The Devil In The Dark has a good old tale of the protagonist v the monster retold in an updater future version so how can it not work especially if there is ""spock"" drama in it; the whole mind reading sequence was a nice touch in this.",

Anyone with half a brain would not send any more men to be senselessly killed until they had a better plan to deal with it! The lone guards getting fried by the creature, after they just gape at it and scream stupidly was idiotic. And why did they need guards anyway???
However, things got infinitely better plot-wise as the episode continued. In fact, I think it was a great plot. I would've given this episode a 10 if the beginning made more sense and the Horta costume wasn't so ""Lost In Space"" ultra cheesy.",8
0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Errand of Mercy (TV Episode 1967)",One of the best of the series.,"The Federation and the Klingon Empire go to war. Kirk and Spock beam down to the pacifist but strategically-located planet Organia to negotiate with the inhabitants for use of their world in the coming conflict. But then the Enterprise gets driven away from the planet by a Klingon invasion fleet, and Kirk and Spock get marooned on Organia as the Klingons occupy it. And as Kirk and Spock try to figure a way out of this mess, the native Organians seem inexplicably indifferent that the Klingons have taken over their world and threaten their lives.This episode resides at the top of the heap of Trek. Here is a well-paced, tension-filled, logical plot with good characters and an intriguing riddle at its core. John Colicos gives a simply great performance as the Klingon commander Kor, who is menacing and ruthless, yet oddly likable as he pontificates on martial virtue and survival of the fittest. And he gets the all time great line in Trek: ""I don't trust a man who smiles too much."" What is so interesting is that, despite Kirk's protests that he and Kor have completely different world views, and despite Kirk's obvious disgust with the Klingons, Kirk and Kor do seem to have similarities in character. They certainly agree in their contempt for the passive Organians.John Abbot is fascinating as the seemingly spineless Organian leader who turns out to be a lot more than anybody anticipated. And the riddle of what the Organians are all about, and why they seem so aloof to what's happening around them, drives the episode nicely. And as always, the interplay between Kirk and Spock is familiar, comforting, and entertaining; note the scene where Spock provides a guesstimate of their chances of surviving a particular ordeal, and Kirk is as always respectfully amused at his best bud's brilliant yet socially oblivious personality.And the final scene, where we learn why and who the Organians are, is a perfect wrap up of character and plot. It's great to see Kirk and Kor both devolve into helpless outrage when they realize their war is being preempted by beings they had previously looked down upon as weaklings. And it's even better to see Kirk grow embarrassed when the Organians bring it home to him that he is behaving as much like a bore as the Klingons are. It's a triumph of realistic, sympathetic character development.Overall, ""Errand of Mercy"" nails it. It's too bad every episode could not be this good.",9
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Errand of Mercy (TV Episode 1967)",Klingon Rule - Not a Pleasant Prospect,"Here they come...now they're here, the Klingons - aggressive, ruthless and sadistic - make their first appearance in the Trek universe. Kirk describes their society as a military dictatorship and there are parallels to Nazi rule in Europe during World War II. The Klingons take over a seemingly primitive civilization here briefly, with Kirk & Spock stuck in disguise in the center of it as a genuine war escalates up above in space (back to the folly of war as in ""Balance of Terror""). The Klingons, as first presented here, are not total barbarians (tho they come close), as they do place value on glorious battle & courage in the middle of their penchant for torture, and only start executing populations when affronted somehow (well, good for them). The Klingon commander, Kor (Colicos in a sinister, threatening performance), also resembles a disciple of Genghis Khan and his marauding hordes, as if those invaders suddenly got their hands on 23rd-century technology. There's talk of political causes for the sudden escalation to war with the Federation, but how can anyone expect such an aggressively violent society as the Klingon Empire to stay out of war for any reasonable amount of time? It seems like a closed book and an inevitable outcome when trying to come up with reasons to stop the widespread hostility on display in this episode.This may be the real motivation for the actions of the Organians in this episode. When their true nature is revealed, we get the impression they see very little, if any, difference between Starfleet (Kirk, Spock) and the invading Klingons. This attitude, of course, was on display from the beginning of the episode, causing Kirk great frustration before the truth was, er, illuminated in front of him. From his perspective, how could anyone not see the differences between his benevolent society and the slave-labor worlds dominated by Klingons? But, if you or I look down on the ground and see two armies of ants waging their little war, would we really pick a side? To us, ants are ants - why would we prefer one side to the other? However, we probably wouldn't take the trouble to stop the ants from fighting - and this is the puzzling aspect to the actions of the Organians in the end. Perhaps they realized, due to the nature of the Klingons, leaving them and the Federation to their own devices would lead to some kind of galactic devastation. Klingons continued to bedevil Kirk is several more episodes of the original series and the Trek movies. In the TNG series, they began to lean towards the honorable traits and away from the sadism.But, this episode works on other insightful levels, from our perspective in the 21st century. Throughout the episode, it's spelled out, even by Kor himself, that there is indeed very little difference between Klingons and Humans, besides minor 'ideological' ones. Kor also has one of the better lines in this season (""I do not trust men who smile too much""). He and Kirk find themselves agreeing a bit too well on their erroneous view of the seemingly contemptible Organians and, despite Kor's amusing protests, the episode's function as prophecy seems to hold true - that eventually the two warring factions will be allies in some future. Though it does seem unlikely during this episode, it does predict the events of the ""Star Trek: the Undiscovered Country"" film and the TNG series. This episode also has distinct similarities to ""Arena,"" where-in the Metrons, another highly-evolved race, also interfered with our immature warlike tendencies. The deus ex machina nature of these story lines, courtesy of such 'higher powers,' makes them a little weaker than the more hard-hitting episodes of the series, but they remain high concept science fiction.",8
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Errand of Mercy (TV Episode 1967)",Introducing the Klingons,"This episode opens with the Enterprise heading to the world of Organia to prevent the Klingons seizing this harmless but strategically important planet. Kirk and Spock beam down and are surprised at the level of passivity displayed by the locals; they are totally unconcerned about the prospect of a Klingon invasion. They insist they are in no danger but have no obvious means of defending themselves. When the Klingons arrive in force Kirk orders the Enterprise to retreat back to Federation space. Trapped on the planet Kirk pretends to be a local while Spock poses as a Vulcan merchant. Kor, the leader of the Klingon invasion is disgusted by the way the Organians don't fight back but respects Kirk's anger and makes him his liaison officer. With nobody else offering any resistance Kirk and Spock destroy a Klingon munitions dump which leads to reprisals. Kirk can't understand why the Organians continue to remain passive but it turns out that they are far from the backward people everybody thought them to be.This episode's main claim to fame is the introduction of Star Trek's best known villains; the Klingons. Here they are merely rather swarthy men rather than the heavily made-up characters viewers of latter series will be familiar with. John Colicos does a fine job as Kor; he makes a great antagonist without making the character a pantomime villain. The Organian's prove to be more interesting than they first appear although I'm sure most viewers will have guessed that they aren't quite what they seem long before the reveal. The episode is also notable for showing that there can be a degree of hypocrisy from the Federation; Kirk is happy to pressure the Organians to do as he suggests yet is outraged when it is they who interfere in the conflict between the Federations and the Klingons an hypocrisy he acknowledges later. This is an episode all 'Star Trek fans' will want to see both for the story and the introduction of the Klingons.",9

Possibly Gandhi's non-violence taken to the extreme?It's not of course and the explanation is something that neither human or Klingon like to contemplate.

Indeed, guest star John Colicos, who plays the series' first Klingon commander, took the part because of the excellent script. The episode involves the Enterprise being sent to peaceful Organia to prevent the Klingons from using it as a strategic location in its expansion and enslaving its apparently primitive and non-violent inhabitants. However, instead of accepting Kirk's offer of help to prevent a Klingon take-over the Organians don't appear to be the least bit interested, to the consternation of Kick and Spock. Meanwhile, in space the Federation and the Klingon Empire prepare for all out war, paralleling Nazi Germany's expansion and the US being drawn into WW II. In true TOS fashion, the plot twists take you on a merry roller-coaster ride, each more fantastic than the last. Colicos' role as the Klingon Commander is superbly acted, portraying the ruthlessness and violent nature of the Klingons. Mr. Colicos was supposed to appear in that role in future episodes, but was unfortunately unable to due to other acting obligations.

The bumps on the head and long scary hair are not to be seen--this didn't come until the first Star Trek movie (and even then, they still didn't look exactly like the later Klingons). Fortunately, the leader of the Klingons is John Calicos--a slimy character actor who almost always played villains. He was just perfect for the role and contributed a lot to the episode.The show starts with Spock and Kirk landing on a planet that is about to be invaded by Klingons. The pre-industrial residents seem to care less about the invasion despite their best efforts to warn them of impending death or slavery. However, before they can go back to the ship, the Klingons land and the guys are stuck among the smiling and somewhat zombie-esquire residents. For most of the rest of the film, Kirk and Spock try to wage war against the Klingons--hoping to get the residents to join them. How this is all handled is truly interesting and a fitting conclusion to the madness.",8

Unlike that famous classic film however, the intruders are Earthlings and Klingons, each intent on achieving sway with the council elders of Organia. I'm a bit amazed that the Enterprise managed to visit so many Class-M planets so far in it's first series run. Considering we might have been subjected to all those goofy 'B' movie space suits so prevalent in the Fifties, that might have been a wise idea.There's a real interesting scene near the finale just before the Organians turn the tables on Kirk and Kor (John Colicos). When it became apparent the Organians had the upper hand, Kor was suddenly willing to team up with the Captain to achieve victory. Isn't that the way with all despots - attempting to gain advantage through treachery? Hitler allowed Neville Chamberlain 'peace in our time' while he turned his attention to fighting Russia.Of course, the Organians and their leader Ayelborne (John Abbott) had no way of knowing who the real aggressor might have been. So their decision to neutralize both sides was an obviously sound one. Spock didn't disappoint me here, he said 'Fascinating' at the precise moment when I was asking myself - why doesn't Spock say 'Fascinating'. With Kirk and Kor both checkmated, the Organians reveal just what they think of these opposing warriors - go away, you bother us.",7

The boys begin to wage war with Klingon forces, altruistically becoming their defenders. They explode bombs and fire weapons. In the meantime, several Organians are killed to make a point. This is the first appearance of the Klingons and they are set forth as evil adversaries. The conclusion is one of the most satisfying moments in all of Star Trek because it shows us that we often lack imagination when it comes to our self centeredness. Everyone is taught a lesson.",8

Colicos' Kor becomes the archetypal personality for Klingon military leaders until the Klingons are somewhat redefined in DS9. Kor establishes mercilessness as his model and begins executing Organians who do not offer complete and open cooperation. And the Organians don't care. They sit back, aloof - neither resisting nor cooperating, and frustrate both Kor and Kirk.The episode offers a brilliant, somewhat nihilistic and humbling resolution - which you will have to see for yourself, and is one of the most satisfying of TOS.

War appears imminent between the Federation and the Klingon Empire, and the Enterprise is dispatched to secure the strategically-placed planet of Organia, and keep it from falling into Klingon hands. The inhabitants of Organia seem incredibly blasé about what is happening all around them; the community Kirk and Spock beam down to resembles a European village around 1700 or so. There is a telling moment early on when the two materialize and passers-by don't even blink. ""You'd think they had people beaming down every day,"" Kirk says. The village elders are intelligent, calm, soft-spoken, and completely unperturbed about the prospect of war or living in a Klingon slave labor camp. Klingons arrive (the Enterprise is forced to withdraw, stranding Kirk and Spock on the planet) and proceed to make the population's enslavement a reality. Two-fisted Kirk wants to lead the Organians in a resistance movement but they haven't the slightest interest. In the end, it is revealed the Organians are not the docile primitives we'd been led to believe, but rather a highly-advanced race of beings who were never threatened by either side in the first place. They are not human at all, rather 'pure energy,' and they only adopted human form for the humans' and Klingons' benefit. The Organians force both sides into a peace treaty and the war is called off as it was just beginning. The episode itself is not quite as satisfying as its premise and plot make it sound; the usual limitations of a weekly series come into play as always, but 'Errand of Mercy' certainly ranks among Star Trek's best.",8

Shatner's Kirk is as driven to spill blood as Colicos's Kor- though for different reasons. THIS ""fallibilty factor"" (as I call it) was one of the more interesting aspects of the original series: more than once, we see our hero, Kirk, in a less-than-flattering light (in this episode and in episodes like THE CONSCIENCE OF THE KING and OBSESSION), where his normally firm grasp of things proves a tad shaky. (And, in a host of episodes- like THE DOOMSDAY MACHINE and OMEGA GLORY and others- we see The Fallibilty Factor in other starship captains.) Kirk, too, gets his come-uppance here. Another great episode.",10

It is well- conceived, tightly written, and a great mixture of thought-provoking insight and humorous irony. The idea of an entire species and culture being without physical form isn't a new idea (Asimov for one explored this in his Foundation series almost 20 years earlier), but for network TV a half century ago it's a brilliant episode.I agree with others about John Colicos as Kor. While malevolent enough for a Klingon leader, he plays the role with complexities that are often missing in ST bad guys. He and Kirk are indeed alike in their contempt for the Organians, to the point where Kor proposes an alliance with Kirk. It's remarkable also that in this, the first ever appearance of Klingons, Ayelborne foresees the day when the Federation and Klingon Empire will be friends.

The Klingon Empire is described as being a military dictatorship. The Klingons are the self proclaimed conquerors of space (or will be anyway), and Organia being in the disputed region, it is one of the first planets to fall into the fray.Kirk and Spock take it upon themselves to show the primitives how they can resist the tyranny of Klingon occupation. Kor protests and takes action.But there's a twist here. The battlefield that would be, one inhabited by the primitives of a far flung world, has a secret that the warring parties will discover.It's a bit of a condescending episode in terms of what causes international conflict, and on the same vein rather naive. There's a real ivory tower perspective on the part of the author of this particular episode as he imparts his personal wisdom and outlook on why countries war with one another.But, there it is. Opposing sides stare one another in the face, ready to annihilate life on a planetary scale when something happens. There's an admonishment from an over-bearing school teacher with all of the common sense of a PTA mother who utters inane phrases to her children after they've been bullied. The concept was to show how ridiculous the exercise would be, and the bloodshed as a result.This episode is a reflection the face between the then so called First and Second World powers, with the Third World caught in the middle. It is an unexpected twist from the Third World representative that we get the PTA mother for the episode. As such the action in this episode is confined to Star Fleet's executive officers hailing from the U.S.S.

The Enterprise is forced to retreat when a Klingon fleet arrives and takes over control of the planet with Kirk & Spock captured upon it. But, like a group of parents who are tired of listening to their children squabble, the Organians break up the conflict between the two sides, showing their evolutionary and intellectual superiority, making Kirk and his counterpart named Kor seem petty.This is one of the best episodes of Season 1! I love the indifference with which the Organians treat every threat thrown their way. Kirk never even tries to understand the Organians; he assumes he's so far above them that they can't even understand the conundrum they find themselves in. At the end of the episode, Kirk looks back and realizes he's not the biggest fish in the pond like he originally presumed. It's an important lesson.

It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. Unlike any other hit series, it only has 3 seasons so luckily it means that they will be covering up all their ideas within it until they are satisfied. As it often happens, the first season is always promising and has potential (or else it won't lift up for further more seasons) in it and is utilized with fine detailed work like focusing on different new breeds and characters bonding through this journey.Errand Of Mercy does resemble with some of the previous episode of this series but it surely doesn't go that way due to its unpredictable script that is written powerfully and is filled with political satires and battle tricks that ensues in war.",
15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Errand of Mercy (TV Episode 1967)",Star Trek: The Original Series - Errand of Mercy,"""Errand of Mercy"" is pure enjoyment if just because Kirk is put in his place regarding the use of violence and the building potential of war between the Federation and Klingons by pacifistic Organians (John Abbott, their chief leader, among a peace counsel) who inhabit a planet both sides wish to occupy as a base. But John Colicos as the Klingon, Captain Kor, is the chief reason this episode is so much fun to watch. It is such a delicious part to sink his teeth into. Kor invades the Organian planet and sets up Klingon headquarters with Kirk and Spock parading as citizens of the people in order to conceal their ties to the Enterprise. Eventually Abbott and his counsel ""betray"" Kirk and Spock, informing Kor of their true identity. Then the Organian's help Kirk and Spock escape imprisonment, even hiding them, but when the Klingons respond by ""killing 200 locals"", and no attempts to save them, our Enterprise duo remain astonished at their unwillingness to respond with violence in kind. The anti-violence message is quite noised throughout and with Kirk and Kor arguing about how the Organians have no right dictating terms to them about how they conduct themselves off the planet (the Organians reluctantly take it upon themselves to interfere with the Klingon/Federation conflict by placing intense heat on all weapons, not allowing weapons of violence (or even combat by hand) to be used against each other), it does leave this impression of ""if only our own planet had Organians to use that same power here"". Colicos' confidence and showboating, instilled in his Kor, sure that the Klingon Empire would vanquish and conquer, only to be shackled by a peaceful race of lifeforms that are more than they appear in the Organians is most ironic. This smiling race that is so unconcerned about the planet being overtaken by tyrants, with Kirk especially critical of the Organians' non-efforts at saving their own, admitting that their behavior bothered him to the core, to the point of shame, builds perfectly to the finale when it is revealed that they were in control the entire time, truly showing their real form, as Spock responds with this look of realization (you can see it all come together and make sense, with Nimoy's face reflecting this) that the actions taken by the Federation and Klingon empire against one another deserved to be halted. Amusing proclamation from the Organians that the Federation and Klingons would be allies one day is foreshadowing. Kor disappointed he couldn't engage with Kirk in a major battle, accepting that the Organians preventing them from doing so denied him something ""glorious"" is done with such relish by Colicoshistory would take him on a different path. Kirk's unapologetic ridicule of the Organians, deciding he and Spock would engage the enemy on their own, with Spock giving exact depressing odds of what they were up against is a highlight...Kirk, a take charge kind of guy, and these idle Organians who refuse to use violence at all is a fascinating duality of conflicting personalities. This episode is a landmark in respect to the Klingons, and what a way to introduce them with Colicos.",8
16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Errand of Mercy (TV Episode 1967)","Similar to ""Arena"" but better (and worse) in some ways","The premise of this episode is that the Enterprise and the Klingons are locked in a struggle for control of a seemingly primitive planet which has strategic value solely due to its location. The ""primitive"" Organians turn out to be anything but.This episode was quite similar to ""Arena"", where Kirk is forced, by an advanced race, to battle the powerful (but slow-moving) Gorn commander in order to save his ship. But this episode was better than that one in some ways, and worse in others.It was better in that the advanced race here-- the Organians-- are, unlike the Metrons of ""Arena""-- a truly benevolent and peaceful race. They try to avoid interference at all, at first. When they are finally forced to act, they act to prevent any and all violence, including violence the Federation would perpetrate against the Klingons, whereas the Metrons would have seemingly been quite willing to wipe out the Gorn ship on a whim, if Kirk had so requested. Here, the Organians, unlike the Metrons, did seem to be an ethically superior race.This episode does suffer, however, from pacing problems. The storyline basically requires that the nature of the Organians' vast power must be kept secret until the end of the episode, but as a result, the episode drags on and on, somewhat dully, and doesn't bear that well on re-watch. ""Arena"", on the other hand, maintained a fairly strong level of tension throughout, as Kirk desperately searched for a means to overcome his foe.On the plus side, this episode introduces the Klingons. Nice acting job by John Colicos here as the Klingon commander. Also a rare opportunity for Sulu to be in command, albeit temporarily.Overall, a fairly enjoyable episode the first time around, but not nearly as much on subsequent viewings.",7

Kirk and Spock beam down to the planet in order to warn them of the impending danger of the Klingons and offer the Organians protection against them. The Organians refuse Kirk's offer and the Klingons arrive and beam down quickly to take the planet over. The Klingon commander Kor quickly finds the Organians with Kirk and Spock who have been disguised as Organians by the Organians themselves and it fools Kor but only for a short time. Kor then holds Kirk and Spock in a cell while the Enterprise, with Sulu in command, waits for more of the Klingons to arrive along with the Federation to begin the war. The Organians will only remain peaceful as the tension builds and it puzzles Kirk, Spock and even the Klingon Commander Kor. Who or what are these peaceful Organians?

Deep in enemy territory, Kirk and Spock fight their way to the seat of power and... everything is canceled by ""superior beings"". Talk about anti-climatic! What's the point of living and fighting for what you hold dear if in the end we are all helpless pawns of an infinitely superior alien race? What's the point of creating a television show centered on a hero like captain Kirk for the viewers to root for, if when the hero gets in trouble, he's not saved by his courage, or intelligence, or creativity, or muscle, but is instead saved by the sudden appearance of a magical character that snaps his fingers and instantly makes everything right? I find this insulting to the viewer's intelligence. Also, this episode pretends to be making some deep statements about existence, but it is really just a simplistic and naive glorification of pacifism. ""What if there was an infinitely powerful race devoted to pacifism that simply physically restrained everyone from fighting without hurting them. Wouldn't that be great?"" No, that would be awful.

It's one of those wild cosmic concepts more prevalent on the TNG series, not restricted to a quadrant or even just our galaxy, but everything. However, the execution of this story and the faulty pace of this episode is rather deplorable. There's way too much repetition throughout: Kirk and some crew beam down to a planet's surface, they go back up to the Enterprise, then back down to the planet, over & over, it seems, with no results; Lazarus falls off a cliff a 2nd time...or is it a 3rd? Much of the attempted efforts to explain the dangerous cosmic effect come off as gobbledygook - is it a doorway in space? A hole between two universes? A corridor with explosions at both ends? Say what? There's also confusion on whether Kirk is dealing with a time traveler here or hopping to parallel dimensions (better realized in ""Mirror,Mirror"" early in the 2nd season). I finally gathered in the end that the threat revolved around matter and anti-matter of two duplicate objects coming together; but, boy, what a headache to get there.Kirk, Spock and the others encounter a weird guy named Lazarus on a barren planet following a 'winking out' of all existence. He rants on about his nemesis, an enemy which looks humanoid but is a monster. By the 2nd act, we realize this Lazarus is insane, but Kirk & especially McCoy aren't so quick on the uptake, while Spock just calls him a liar. After a few very spacey phrases by this Lazarus, I would think they'd realize the guy's not all there when Lazarus says ""Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!"" Yet, as in a few other weak episodes, an obvious nutcase like this one is given free reign within the Enterprise and this causes problems later (I think Kirk did assign security at some point, but they lost Lazarus a minute later). Then we get that 'cosmic effect' and negative images in slow motion for the 4th or 5th time, meant to convey a struggle between - wait for it - two Lazarus dudes! And as we all know, two into one won't go. This episode gets my vote for the worst one of the first season, a precursor to all those really bad, boring ones in the third season. I do give it more stars than those due to a genuinely chilling denouement at the conclusion.",5

Meanwhile, a man falls off a cliff, again and again, and is cured by a small plaster, though blood drips from his mouth.

In this case, living with the knowledge that to preserve the status quo, great sacrifices sometimes have to be made, and the survivors have to live with the knowledge of that.Kirk and crew are on a routine trip when the whole universe 'winks out' momentarily, as if it had ceased to exist. Simultaneously a raggedly dressed space traveller appears out of nowhere. The two events are clearly connected. Lazarus, as he is called, is actually a being who exists in two universes, yet somehow flits between them. There's a good Lazarus, and a bad, or are it/they really both at the same time? The 'good' Lazarus knows he has to put a stop to this universe-surfing to prevent the annihilation of all space and time, so, yes, there's quite a bit at stake as usual.Lazuras's tiny spacecraft, the size of a bubble car, was immediately recognisable to me - I wonder in which bunch of neurones in my brain that vision is stored - and it's size is at surreal odds with the events going on all around. I'd love to know whether this was intentional, or just a lazy effort on the prop department's part that week - I like the red star on top of the cockpit, looking suspicious like it's been borrowed off one of those children's rides that one finds parked in shopping malls or outside supermarkets. Likewise the anguished cries of Lazarus as Kirk has to propel him towards eternal doom is another image that is stored 'up there' and was immediately recognisable.Robert Brown gives a bravura performance as Lazarus, suitably intense as someone/something with both heroic and demonic qualities. He does have a penchant for falling off cliff edges with some regularity, but this is TV-land, where something like that has to come along now and then to bracket the commercial breaks (thankfully in the United Kingdom we've only ever had uninterrupted episodes).On the basis of the strong impressions it gave me as a 10-year-old, the keen performances, and that I've just re-watched it and been entertained again, a high mark.",7

The man easily travels through Time and Space and yet he keeps falling into Space all of the Time? When TOS was originally issued on VHS, this was one episode I made sure I didn't buy.

Wouldn't it just result in the destruction of the two objects? Much nonsense in this episode, like talks about a ""negative magnetic corridor"" and an ""alternative space warp."" Inexplicable scenes of combat between the two Lazari are interspersed throughout the episode.But despite all of these problems, I still find the ending to be remarkably affecting. The ""good"" Lazarus makes the ultimate sacrifice-- and I do mean ultimate! He is willing to be trapped in mortal combat with his double for all eternity, as a ""small price to pay"" for two universes. Sheesh, I seriously doubt that most people would not consider that to be ""too high a price to pay""-- I think most people would figure, the heck with it, just let the universes be destroyed rather than to suffer like that! Kirk seems deeply impressed by the sacrifice (as well he should be).Great ending dialogue between Kirk and Spock-- ""There is of course, no escape for them, sir... There is of course, no escape...

Both the sci-fi physics element and the madman element of the premise are fascinating. But this explanation comes in the last 5 minutes of the show, after 40 minutes of exhausting shenanigans -- too late to even buy the ""r"" in the word ""redeem.""I would love to know the backstory about how this episode went from fascinating concept to crummy filmed episode.

The second time didn't help much either. But you know, even a great series like Star Trek will have it's clunkers, and this would be one of them. Almost comical in a way, because if you pay attention, you'll see stuff like Lazarus' whiskers and beard change in texture and fullness over the course of the story. Yeah, yeah, it could have been Lazarus Two, but not if you keep tabs on Lazarus One.The thing that threw me off right from the start was Kirk's reaction to Code Factor One. He states to the Federation Commodore that he's explored ALL the alternatives, and concludes that an invasion is imminent. Really? So what were some of those other alternatives? There was absolutely no basis for Kirk to come to that conclusion, given the way the story had unfolded so far.Well, time travel stories usually make my head hurt, but for once, even though the twin Lazaruses (Lazari?) were chasing around through time, that really didn't seem to matter. Or anti-matter as it were. You know, I didn't plan that, it just came out that way. Interestingly, the time travel element seemed to be overthrown by the 'rip in the universe' theory and the corridor between parallel universes. At least that's something I can understand.What I find really interesting if you watch a TV series in episode order like I'm doing now with Star Trek, you manage to pick up on little bits of trivia that might have escaped you while watching in random order in TV re-runs. Remember the set with the red screen on the left and the two wall computers positioned slightly to the right. The same set up was used before, I believe in Episode #1.7 - What are Little Girls Made Of? You don't think a lot about how these shows had to stay in budget, but when you see an example of a recycled set like that, it's a neat reminder that even the iconic shows had to watch their pennies.",7

The 1960s saw people who believed their white, masculine identity was being threatened by African Americans, hippie youths & feminist women. Like Bad Lazarus, they had to kill their Double.The Enterprise left behind the super criminals on planet Botany Bay. Good riddance! But couldn't they have rescued poor Lazarus, With a Madman At His Neck Eternally? I always find the ending disturbing and sad and, therefore, a welcome change from the usual ""Well we got the Captain or Spock or the crew back safely again.""In fact you can't understand the mad atmosphere of paranoia in The Alternative Factor outside of its 1967 historic context. When Spock warns Kirk that Lazarus presents the danger of Complete Annihilation & The Destruction of Civilization & Existence, for the folks at home watching NBC, this was no Sci Fi plot but in the Cold War reality of their lives when, as JFK put it a nuclear sword was dangling over all our heads by a thread",9
8,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Alternative Factor (TV Episode 1967)",Worst episode of first season,"The storyline for ""The Alternative Factor"" is a great concept  the possibility of a negative parallel universe and a madman whose insane actions could lead to the destruction of EVERYTHING. But there are several aspects of this episode that really bother me, and IMHO, ""The Alternative Factor"" is the worst first-season episode. I like the concept for this episode. I also like the dialogue between Kirk and Spock in the briefing room when they finally put all of the pieces of the puzzle together. But letting Lazarus roam freely about the ship is a flaw I can't excuse, and the final solution seems a bit drastic. I'm also not a fan of the special effects. For the most part, first-season episodes are pretty good, but this episode feels like it was put together in a big hurry. I'm giving ""The Alternative Factor"" a D grade and will find an alternative episode to watch when I can.",1
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Alternative Factor (TV Episode 1967)",A bit of a klunker.,"According to ""Star Trek; the Inside Story"" by Solow and Justman (the two original producers of the Star Trek series) there were some contractual issues with the actor who was supposed to play the guest lead, and thus this caused some scheduling issues which cascaded into other areas of production.Result; this episode.Well, what can a guy say about an installment that was supposed to be the crown jewel of Trek, but wound up being a bucket of swill? An ""A"" for effort... err... maybe.Things that I spotted; there's an exterior shot showing Kirk and Spock leading a search team, but the actors are their stunt doubles, and not Shatner and Nimoy. The lead character seems prone to injury, and the science fiction in this episode is more fiction than science.I'll say this, the reason I tend to prefer classic 1960's Trek to the TNG+ era, is because the first season of TOS Trek is psychological; the second season is sociological, while the third season is more interpersonal (with all its flaws). This episode really strove to be a true science-fiction story, and not some encoded amalgam conveying a comment on contemporary society.No, this episode really wanted to post the question of sacrifice to save two realms of existence. As stated earlier, director Gerd Oswald wanted the son of a famous actor who had star power (the name escapes me). Said actor was drunk and didn't show up for the shoot. SAG threw the book at the actor for breaking his contract, and torpedoing what could've been an interesting, and a true first pure sci-fi masterpiece for this very memorable series.But, blaming the guest star for all the foibles isn't fair. Truth is the writing was a little weak in this episode. Without a psychological formula to rely on this episode was truly trying to break new ground. But, because the author(s) did not know enough about the science they were dealing with, and only the philosophical dilemma of what they wanted to pose for the audience, the story falls flat.Even so, it's still fun to see our favorites run around on the screen to save the Federation (and everyone else in this case) from a fate worse than death.Not a sterling installment. Watch only in passing... if at all.",

The script seems muddled, the science seems plausible initially (identical particles of matter and anti-matter do annihilate and produce radiation, however human bodies are not ""particles"") until we see Kirk in the anti-matter universe. The instant his skin made of matter contacted the anti-matter atmosphere there would have been a big bang... The acting by Robert Brown as the mad (matter) Lazarus was over the top by even my standards (I consider Shatner an excellent actor) although his sane twin was done much better. As for the pluses there was the lovely Janet MacLachlan as a Lt. in charge of the Dilithium Crystals. Her role does however seem almost as if it were inserted by the producers as an afterthought. But the sentiment behind it is very much appreciated (although it was already being ""covered"" by Nichelle Nichols - still never too much of a good thing).",8

The repeated shot in white-on-dark-blue silhouette of two figures struggling, the whole shot spinning on screen and visually mixed with astronomy photos of some distant galaxy was effective the first couple of times but with no discernible variation also became boringly repetitive. However the attempt to stage a story about a scientifically not-impossible phenomenon of mind-boggling difficulty to visualize was brave given the budget and the state of special effects in the mid 1960s.Notable also is that in this episode we have to assume that not only Chief Engineer Scott but also Sulu are on leave, and not aboard the Enterprise for this tour; and that instead we have ""company"" for Lt Uhuru, another African American woman officer, Lieutenant Masters (Janet MacLachlan), in charge in Engineering, plus unfamiliar faces at the helm on the bridge!",5
13,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Alternative Factor (TV Episode 1967)",Ambitious and interesting idea.... weakly executed,"This episode of TOS suffered from a mediocre script and very average directing. Robert Brown does a fair job of performing the rather maniacal Lazarus -an interesting biblical allusion, but a bit difficult to interpret the meaning given the character. The cinematography and the script impose limitations that inhibit dramatic development.The Alternative factor is essentially a sci-fi mystery (hence the choice of Gerd Oswald, known for Perry Mason, as the director). It presents a plot with some interesting, though somewhat impossible, roots in theoretical physics. The known universe is, apparently, about to be destroyed by a malevolent humanoid from the universe of antimatter. Lazarus has been chasing this being for years - to exact revenge for the destruction of his world. The Enterprise crew is stymied and confused (as will be most members of the audience), until the identity of the would-be destroyer is revealed.Basically, the story line could have been interesting given an hour or so more explanation. As it stands, it appears to be strafed with plot-holes and inconsistent characterization. The franchise, however, learned from its mistakes and did better with similar approaches in a few episodes of TNG and DS9.",5

This is the first truly awful episodes of Star Trek--even worse than the ""Charlie X"" episode!! Now THAT'S bad!! The biggest problem is that the character of Lazarus is just dopey and boring. He rants and raves and lies and just annoys the daylights out of the audience. Plus, despite all the cheesy over-acting by Lazarus, the pay-off just isn't worth waiting for at all! In so many ways, this episode looked either like a ""throw away"" episode or perhaps one that had been written and re-written again and again and just wasn't perfected. Regardless, the episode has few thrills or excitement and no laughs. In fact, unless you are a huge Trekkie, it isn't worth your time.FYI--If you want to see the worst episode, there are still probably two or three that managed to surpass this one in lousiness.UPDATE: By the way, it isn't just me who hated this episode.

15,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The Alternative Factor (TV Episode 1967)","confusing, weak entry","The 'good' greatly outnumbered the 'bad' in the first season of 'Star Trek,' in terms of episode quality. In fact, one could argue that the only out-and-out stinker in that opening set of shows is 'The Alternative Factor,' which is confusing to the point of being incomprehensible at times. The universe is in danger of 'winking out,' and if you find the explanation of this phenomenon a little weak, join the club. Maybe it's the 23rd century equivalent of 'freaking out.' Anyway, it's not a good thing, and the Enterprise tracks the source of the trouble to a man on a desolate planet and his small spacecraft there on the surface. The man, Lazarus, is not much help in explaining things either, babbling on and on, sometimes hysterically, about how he has to stop somebody and how Kirk and crew must help him. About a half-dozen times during the episode (seems like more) we are treated to a spinning visual effect that settles on a murky, foggy corridor of sorts where two figures are seen locked in a fierce struggle. Also, Lazarus has a bad habit of falling off cliffs. McCoy treats him for a head injury, and even though he is clearly unbalanced and dangerous, turns him loose to wander the ship and steal a couple of dilithium crystals. When Kirk finds out, naturally being a bit perturbed, he asks McCoy where Lazarus went. McCoy shrugs and says, ""Oh I don't know, Jim. It's a big ship."" Just totally blows Kirk off. Thank YOU, Dr. McCoy. Anyway, the episode meanders along, and between the spinning corridor scenes and Lazarus falling off a cliff here and there, we finally get to the heart of the matter. A parallel anti-matter universe threatens to collide with our own, destroying everything everywhere. Lazarus has a double in the other universe, a madman, and the only hope is to trap Lazarus and his mad double in the corridor for all eternity. Which they manage to do.

Those two episodes were ""Court Martial"" and ""The Alternative Factor"" both of which rank low in my opinion for entertainment value for Trek. I would not see them until I was in my 30's so it's possible that not having seen them first as a child has made me less open to liking the, or it may be that they are just bad episodes; for me, I don't think I'm reaching too far by labeling them bad. The Alternative Factor though wins the honor as a bottom 5 episode while Court Martial doesn't reach those absolute lows based on some decent acting scenes. The reason why I think this episode is so poor is the story is just plain stupid, the characters are made to be stupid, especially Spock, there is little or no parts for characters like Scottie, Sulu, Ohura, Bones, I mean even Yeoman Rand would have helped and I hated her! LOL. OK now it's plot hole time, why couldn't they just phaser the time machine so that neither one could get through? Just make sure you have the nice Lazarus on your dimension, lol. Oh well the other Lazarus seemed like a good guy to go drinking with at a Klingon bar, right? Anyway, way too much time spent with out guest character and not nearly enough with our Enterprise crew means no matter how good the plot (which is not here anyway) it won't get sold. 3 of 10 even though it's Trek, it's a pain to watch and I won't be next time I see it on. So what are your bottom 3 Trek episodes? Here are mine, I don't think they will change if I re-watch them soon, these are based on my memories that go back several years, as a male viewer.

This is like the Leidenfrost layer that forms if a drop of water is sprinkled on a hot skillet - it dances around. At the right temperature, several hundred degrees, steam insulates the water drop and it lasts much longer than at a higher or lower temperature. Another example is walking on hot coals with bare feet. So, similar to the Angels and Demons movie, antimatter may not blow up all at once.

And they had already done a lot of ""person split in two"" type shows that were entertaining, as well as thought provoking. This one was neither. Probably the worst was the cheesy and fake matter/anti- matter special effects, which looked terrible. The whole premise of the episode didn't hang together. Spock calling the man a ""liar"" seemed out of character, too. Just yucky all around. In reading up on the show, apparently the actor slated to play Lazurus bowed out at the last minute, ie John Barrymore. Leaving the producers high and dry until they scraped up an unknown by the name of Robert Brown. He tried, but there wasn't enough time left to do a good job, and the script was very weak anyway. Maybe that was the real reason Barrymore left so abruptly. I thought it was interesting that when interviewed not long ago, Brown described Leonard Nimoy as ""morose""on the set.

The alternate Browns switching places on occasion with Bones recognizing this while Kirk thinks he might have a few screws loose, Brown's positive matter human unstable and consumed with killing the antimatter self, and poor MacLachlan and Derr in Engineering always enduring Brown's violence towards them are some other plot shenanigans that accumulate to give plenty of reason why this episode is disregarded and held in such low esteem.

0,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The City on the Edge of Forever (TV Episode 1967)",Forever on Our Minds,"This is that one episode of the original Trek series which contained a certain inspired, sublime quality, which transcended the limitations of even the best episodes (translation: 10+ stars). We know there is greatness here, but what exactly is this impression that staggers us? Famed writer Harlan Ellison wrote the original teleplay, which was re-written by other hands (causing some controversy that continues to this day) to presumably make it fit better within the confines of Roddenberry's and television's view of the Trek universe. Very briefly, Ellison looked at human beings as more flawed (which, of course, they are) and probably regarded Roddenberry's vision of near-perfect future humanity as a bit too bland. This is television we're speaking about here, when all is said and done, and blandness is de rigueur. But, even the re-writes could not reduce this magnificent piece to anything less than the masterpiece of its day.The City that the title refers to, on the surface, appears to be the eerie setting we see in the first act, with ruins, as Kirk notes, stretching to the horizon. It is here that we first see the Guardian of Forever, a strange rock-like arch which actually functions as a time portal. We've all seen time travel stories before, with similar devices (""The Time Travelers"" from '64, for example). But, it's what happens after we enter the portal that then defines the story and weaves a tale of bitter, even mind-numbing tragedy. There's a chill odor assaulting us even before all this happens, a foreboding, as the Guardian intones 'All that you knew...is gone' after a deranged McCoy leaps into Earth's past. Without having to show the audience anything - anything physical or expository - the story lets us know that the Federation has been wiped away. All that in the span of a few seconds - all gone... just gone. The cosmic hook is that a particular individual, just another citizen in the dim past, can have a profound effect on the course of events within the known galaxy, while others, such as a skid-row bum, would have no effect at all.The City may also be the city of New York, in the 1930's, for this is where a piece of Kirk (or his heart) will always be - forever, as it were. During the week that Kirk and Spock are forced to live a brief out-of-time life there, the story now stirs in the most potent human elements with the most dire cosmic dilemma - it's a fantastic, unforgettable mix. Unfortunately for Kirk, this was the one scenario he was not trained for. You might note, watching any of the other episodes, no matter how outlandish the threat or problem, it's always something Kirk is able to take control of eventually, to grasp and handle in his own persuasive manner. Not here - gradually, he becomes helpless, caught in the undertow of that perhaps strongest of human emotions after he meets a social worker. As with everything in this episode, actors Shatner and Collins seem to transcend their normal limitations. It's amazing that this episode, at least while taking place in this timeless New York City, is only the length of about half-an-hour; it seems like we're with Kirk & Edith for a good week there, much as it was meant to be.As I got older, I found it almost too painful to watch the final act of this episode. It's like a piece of music - so well done, you're compelled to listen, but the notes are heart rending and leave that dull ache, as if you're missing something in life. As a comparison, I would bring to your attention another episode, ""Requiem For Methuselah"" from the 3rd season; it's actually not that bad of an episode, not without interest. But, in that one, Kirk falls in love in the span of an hour and then Spock erases his pain with his Vulcan abilities. Nothing so trite here. By the look on Kirk's face and his words in the final scene, as he dismisses the incredible Guardian, we know he will have to live with this pain forever. 'All IS as it WAS before' the Guardian intones some more. I'm afraid not. Not ever.",10
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The City on the Edge of Forever (TV Episode 1967)",Ellison,"For years Harlan Ellison has snarled about how Gene Roddenberry falsely claimed his script for ""City On The Edge Of Forever"" had Scotty dealing drugs. Well, maybe he did, and if so, then Ellison had reason to be annoyed. But setting that issue aside, after reading his original script it does seem that the changes that were made- in some respects at least- were a definite improvement.Ellison has a mercenary character aboard the Enterprise (not Scotty, of course) exploit another crewman's addiction to an illegal drug so he can get himself assigned to a landing party. That way he can beam down and illegally trade with any native inhabitants. As it works out, the dealer, Beckwith, kills the drug addicted crewman and then finds himself convicted of murder with a sentence of death to be carried out on the planet surface. Upon arrival however, he escapes into the past and screws up history. Okay, the thing that doesn't seem to work so well about this aspect of Ellison's story is the large amount of time spent in the first act introducing these two new characters. Roddenberry's writers wisely turn the focus back on the regular cast with McCoy becoming the victim of an accidental narcotics overdose that renders him temporarily insane. McCoy becomes the unwitting catalyst for the altering of history, making Kirk and Spock's mission now about both repairing the damage to history- and rescuing a friend. This seems far more emotionally involving than had it remained a pursuit of a sleazy drug dealer through time. Also, by dispensing with the villainous character, they were able to cut out the slightly uncomfortable fact that they were there for the business of executing a prisoner, and in the original script Kirk seems just a touch too eager to carry out that sentence.Another flaw in Ellison's version is the introduction of a bunch of rather prosaic characters: long-robed ancients whose centuries old task is the servicing of the mechanisms that make time travel possible on their world. Of course this is just an opinion, but the pulsating Guardian Of Forever with it's booming voice speaking in enigmatic riddles (even insulting Spock by suggesting his intellect is too limited to grasp it's internal workings) trumps a bunch of old guys in robes any day. Making the now automated time portal a full-fledged character is a very good idea because it allows the Guardian to become it's own ""device"" for delivering exposition, and this seems a more direct method than leaving all the explanations to Ellison's original concept of a group of old men.Also, when history is changed, Ellison has Kirk and company beaming up to the Enterprise and (as in the later episode ""Mirror, Mirror"") discovering that the vessel is now a pirate ship called ""The Falcon"". Kirk and Spock take over the transporter room, locking out the bloodthirsty crew, and then leave the rest of the landing party to fend off the pirates while they beam back down to the planet to try and right history. Considering there's also the pursuit of Beckwith, as well as the love story set in the 1930's, doesn't it sound like there's just too much story here?In the streamlined re-write, Kirk leaves the landing party on the planet surface as he ventures into the past of the 1930's to repair history, and this seems quite sufficient plot-wise without the addition of a pirate Enterprise.One thing that would have been nice to see preserved from Ellison's script occurs in the scene where Edith Keeler has been allowed to die in order to correct history. This is not exactly word for word, but Spock comforts the shattered Kirk by telling him that ""no woman was ever loved so much, for you were willing to give up the whole universe just for her."" It's a very touching, romantic sentiment (coming from the Vulcan no less!) to end on, and represents one of the best aspects of Ellison's version that didn't survive the re-write. While much of what did make it into the finished episode was undeniably Harlan Ellison's, the changes that were made to his script do seem to have been appropriate and helped to make this exceptionally well done episode, arguably, even better.",
2,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The City on the Edge of Forever (TV Episode 1967)",The Perfect Confluence,"""City on the Edge of Forever"" is usually considered one of the best (if not the best) of the series. The praise is well-deserved.During a meteor storm, McCoy accidentally injects himself with an overdose of cordrazine, which leads him to paranoid insanity. He beams himself down to the planet being orbited by the Enterprise, escapes through a time portal, resulting in the obliteration of the Enterprise's world. Kirk and Spock go back through the portal to try and intercept McCoy (who has interfered with the past), and land in the New York City of the 1930s. They are taken in by Edith Keeler (Joan Collins), a pacifistic social worker, and Kirk begins to fall in love.As the summary indicates, this episode is the perfect confluence of superb science fiction writing (Harlan Ellison), well-honed directing (Joseph Pevney), and sensitive acting (Shatner and Nimoy in particular). The script is incredibly well-written by one of the best science fiction writers of all time, and uses modest humor (e.g., Spock's clueless insistence on securing platinum, Kirk's explanation of Spock's ears to a policeman, etc.) to keep the story from becoming overly maudlin. For those who believe that William Shatner could not act (i.e., those who had never seen him in his early TV days), his nuanced and sympathetic performance clearly shows how good of an actor he could be. Likewise, Joan Collins acquits herself quite well, and Nimoy is, as always, marvelous. Spock's final line in the 1930s world alone is worth the viewing.",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The City on the Edge of Forever (TV Episode 1967)",One of science fiction TV's finest moments (so far),"Before you read any review of this, you should check out 'a l i e n's review - it's the one with the highest vote count, and it's entitled Ellison. This user does a very nice job of explaining Harlan Ellison's various issues with the way the script was handled.City on the Edge of Forever is a truly remarkable episode of Star Trek's original series. Written by now-veteran sci fi author Harlan Ellison (with help from Roddenberry and his writing team), and directed by one of the original series' most consistently excellent directors - Joseph Pevney - COEF begins with the Enterprise being bombarded by meteors and Sulu knocked unconscious. McCoy injects him with cordrazine and he is fine, but then McCoy falls on the needle and is injected with an overdose. Deranged, McCoy beams down to a nearby planet and the bridge crew follows shortly thereafter.The rest of the story involves time travel, a bit of romance and some great acting and directing. Kelley, Shatner, Nimoy and guest star Joan Collins give remarkable performances, and bring this fine story to life in a touchingly dramatic and satisfyingly logical manner.If you want to get somebody hooked on ST, this is a great place to start.",10
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The City on the Edge of Forever (TV Episode 1967)",far and away the best Star Trek episode,"It's somehow fitting that the best episode of 'Star Trek' should have taken longer, cost more, and had more controversy attached to it than any other regular season show. There are a number of things one can point to in 'The City on the Edge of Forever' as reasons it should be considered the best, primarily the quality of the writing. Harlan Ellison's original script was not used for several reasons and yet clearly much of what he wrote survived into the final version and it deservedly won a 1968 Hugo Award. The episode seems so much more than just that... it really feels at times as though you're watching a very good motion picture. The eerie beginning, the near-hopelessness of the situation, the interplay between the characters, and that heart-pounding next to last scene where Edith Keeler dies all combine to make 'City on the Edge of Forever' something very special, many times better than the average episode. And just as amazing, it is still 'Star Trek.' There is so much packed into the fifty-minute show and yet it doesn't seem rushed or forced. We actually sit through the opening and first act before Kirk and Spock even arrive in Earth's past. The pivotal character of Edith Keeler is played by Joan Collins (long before 'Dynasty') and it is a perfect bit of casting. The dialogue throughout is sharp and to the point. At one point in the 21st Street Mission where the two officers find themselves portraying homeless men, Spock says, ""I'll finish with the furnace."" And Keeler promptly adds, ""Captain? Even when he doesn't say it, he does."" There are many wonderful touches like that throughout the episode. I wouldn't want to take sides in any Ellison/Roddenberry dispute over 'City on the Edge of Forever,' because they both have good reason to feel proud of it. Ellison not only for the original concept and written version, but also for the literacy and magical sense of wonder he imbues the story with, and Roddenberry for bringing it to life within the constraints of a one-hour network television episode, and doing so with the rest of the 'Star Trek' cast and crew masterfully. 'The City on the Edge of Forever' stands apart from other installments in the series, and is a rare achievement.",9
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The City on the Edge of Forever (TV Episode 1967)",Probably the best of all...,"This episode has it all, a wonderfully written story, catchy title, superb acting, and an unhappy but necessary ending. I recall this story sticking with me through the end of the first season and into the second. The hallmark of a great story is it's staying power, and ""City"" certainly has it.First, the writing. As much controversy there is after the fact as to what Roddenberry did or didn't do with Harlan Ellison's original storyline, the fact remains that it is a dynamite story and incredibly well-crafted for the depth of character development and the continuity of the storyline. What can you say about Ellison as a sci-fi writer that hasn't already been said? The guy is a genius, pure and simple. I simply can't imagine a greater contemporary writer. He is one of a Pantheon of great writers, Heinlein, Bradbury, Clarke. That a series like Star Trek would be able to tap his talents is a real feather in their cap.Regular actors Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelly deliver perhaps their finest performances of the series in this episode. Shatner doesn't miss a beat in his movement from dispassionate mission achievement to a genuine love interest in the Joan Collins character. And Joan Collins demonstrates here her depth as a serious actress. Her portrayal of compassionate social worker Edith Keeler is spot-on. She isn't just another pretty face, another attractive female for Kirk to conquer. She draws him in with her passion for helping others and her gifted insight into the necessity of forging a better destiny for mankind, one individual at a time. Her tragic fate is a mirror for the seemingly senseless and avoidable tragedies of the 20th century. A person dedicated to the service and well-being of others must die prematurely to prevent a greater tragedy. Certainly the eternal question and mystery of our lifetime.Anyway, ""City"" is probably my favorite of many favorite episodes of this classic series. Many thanks to Harlan Ellison and Gene Roddenberry for such a masterful presentation of a great story.",10

Kirk and Spock must go in after him and prevent him from doing something in the past that could alter the future. Kirk finds a love interest, played by Joan Collins, but comes to find out that she will play a key role in determining the outcome of Earth's future. Without spoiling it, lets just say it appears Kirk will never have a steady love relationship as long as he is captain. Great job by Shatner and leaves you numb at the end. He even uses the word ""hell', which was probably a big deal on television in the late 60's.",

This episode provides the most dramatic (not to mention sad) elements in all of Star Trek - and one of Shatner's finer performances as he as to make an ""emotional choice"" at the end of the episode, literally a life and death situation.

McCoy accidentally injects himself with medicine that makes him insane. Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock transport McCoy to a planet with a known time machine to transport him back in time and prevent the mistake from happening. McCoy goes through the machine without Spock and Kirk and lands in 1930's NYC. After Spock and Kirk join him in this time period ( they have no idea where McCoy is) they discover Edith Keeler, played superbly by Joan Collins. It appears that when McCoy entered this time period he prevents Keeler from perishing in a traffic accident. Because Keeler was a peace activist and survived instead of died as before she prevents the US entrance into WW II and the world as we know it is destroyed because Hitler is not defeated. Spock tells Kirk that Keeler must die for all of civilization on Earth to continue. Kirk ends up with a gut-wrenching choice to make; to follow his own heart or sacrifice for the good of mankind. The acting by the characters of Kirk, Spock, McCoy and especially Keeler is astounding. The best Star Trek ever. Don't miss it!",10
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The City on the Edge of Forever (TV Episode 1967)",Sister Edith,"Joan Collins guest stars in this Star Trek episode concerned with how the Enterprise has changed the course of human history by a simple act. So much so that the Enterprise ceases to exist and a landing party on a planet that contains a time portal leaves several Star Trek regulars stranded in time and space with said portal.A temporarily maddened Dr. McCoy jumps through the portal and lands in Depression Era Chicago and Kirk and Spock follow him. Kirk and Spock meet up with Sister Edith Keeler who is not a nun, but she is a woman of charity who runs a soup kitchen there. It is she who even in her drab clothing of the time shows off a lot of inner beauty and charisma. No doubt this woman has leadership potential.The story is a tribute to Leonard Nimoy's scientific skill as he constructs some device that gives them glimpses into alternate history. Edith Keeler becomes the charismatic leader of a pacifist movement which delays America's entry into World War II allowing for an Axis victory and all that means. Remember he's not on the Enterprise and has to do with the technology of the 1930s.It is the life of Sister Edith which is the turning point of time itself and in the climax there are some great closeups shots of Bill Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and DeForest Kelley each expressing different emotions to a tragic event. Worth more than 10 pages of dialog. Collins also in an atypical role registers well. Usually that woman is dressed to the nines in film and here the part doesn't call for that. But she carries it off beautifully.A classic for Star Trek lovers.",8
10,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The City on the Edge of Forever (TV Episode 1967)","Unforgettable, classic episode-perhaps Star Trek's finest hour","No one who has ever watched this fascinating, unpredictable episode will forget it. From the sheer imagination of the time travel storyline, to the genuinely funny dialog of Spock and Kirk as they attempt to fit in to the world of Depression era New York City, to the tragic ending, this is simply a great episode.Shatner's acting is superb, showing us sides of Captain James Kirk seldom even hinted at, with a vulnerability and sensitivity that make his doomed love for Edith Keeler extremely moving . Nimoy gives one of his finest performances as Mr. Spock, mixing dry humor with a real compassion and a depth of character that are amazing. We get to know both Kirk and Spock in a deeper way than in most other episodes, with a touching emphasis on their friendship. Edith comments on their obviously strong bond and tells Spock that she can see that Spock's place is by Kirk's side, as if he had always been there.Joan Collins is simply radiant as Edith Keeler, in a role very different from her usual bad girl image. No wonder Kirk fell in love with her, as even the unemotional Spock could understand the powerful effect she had on his captain.DeForest Kelley remains offstage for much of the episode, yet he is the focal point of everything that's happening. He does a terrific job portraying Doctor McCoy's paranoia and even grief because of the disorienting effects of his drug induced temporary insanity. One brief moment in his confrontation with the frightened derelict is especially memorable. When McCoy dimly begins to recognize that his surroundings look familiar from historical photos, he smiles and looks happy and excited for a moment, muttering that he'd love to see the hospital of this time period. Seconds later, he collapses into an overwhelming sadness at the thought of the primitive surgical methods used by Twentieth Century medicine, and weeps helplessly, as the bum looks on in a mix of fear and concern.Which brings us to the origin of all these fine performances: the brilliant story by Harlan Ellison. The ideas, the characters, the dialog so beautifully performed by the actors all began in the mind and imagination of Ellison, and even though he wasn't happy with the changes made in his script, it is still one of the finest pieces ever written for television, of any kind.City on the Edge of Forever has for years been one of the first Star Trek episodes I refer to when discussing the show with anyone, fan or otherwise. I saw it when it was first televised, and it has stayed with me for over forty years. Everyone connected with this production can be proud of having been a part of such a fine achievement.Addendum: I have watched this episode four times in the last few days, and each time, am more impressed with the quality of the story telling and the acting. The ending is simply devastating. You believe utterly in Kirk's pain and loss, and Spock's detached seeming, but totally understanding and compassionate attitude. Something draws me back again and again to this episode, even though I can hardly bear to watch the overwhelmingly sad ending. From the comments by many others here, it is obvious that that this episode has had a profound effect on most viewers who have ever seen it. If you have never watched it, see it and you'll understand why.",10
11,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The City on the Edge of Forever (TV Episode 1967)",Historically Incorrect,"While this was a very well-acted episode, I have to take issue with the premise that the United States' entry into World War II could have been in any way affected by pacifism. Were the writers in the 1960's not aware that the political leaders of the US in the 1930's knew full well of the atrocities being committed in Germany (the Holocaust), but were too anti-Semitic to care? The US didn't enter World War II until Pearl Harbor in 1941, when it was directly attacked by Japan.Yes, it's science fiction, and yes, I think too much.",8

In any event, I can't add anything to the excellent accolades already posted on 'City..', but I can't say I'm surprised, because, after all, despite its extensive re-writes (which I knew nothing about until now), it's still a Harlan Ellison piece, which is to say -- superb. I particularly agree with the person who gave kudos to Joan Collins. I'm not that familiar with her work -- she seems to be cast mostly in fluff roles, meant to extol her beauty -- but this was a terrific performance. Another post alluded to Shatner's acting ability, with which I also agree -- check out 'The Brothers Karamazov', and you'll see what I mean.

It has been so long since I have watched them on TV, many of them are new again.This episode though, is an outstanding exception. Not because I enjoyed it... I REMEMBERED IT from years ago because of the awful conflicts of ethics that still remain unresolved. Supposedly, if Kirk did not take action, life as he knew it would not exist.Still, it could have been wrong or right. We just don't know. The story was softened so we would feel it was right.. but, what could have become of the bigger picture if time is expanded and we are not locked into our Star Trek box? Maybe it is because of my particular age that this is an indelible episode. Similar concepts have been indulged in other shows. The original Star Trek to me remains a life-time keeper, and this episode a stand out.It offers an end to a particular evil in its box, so we are satisfied. But it still leaves questions. It makes XXXX travel a four-letter word, (even for a Dr. Who fan).",
16,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The City on the Edge of Forever (TV Episode 1967)",One of the very best episodes of the original series,"We're all wired differently, so I expect we all have different takes on and tastes in things. Still, many regard ""City on the Edge of Forever"" as the best of the original ""Star Trek"" series, and it may well be. However, the two-part ""The Menagerie"" (creating a framing story around the scrapped pilot film ""The Cage"") has far more story (and colourful settings/situations) to chew on, and ""The Naked Time"" makes some definitive characterisations of the main cast, as well as being a 'nail biter' of a suspense yarn in the second half of the episode. I suspect Ellison nicked his ""We were successful"" line of Spock's in ""City on the Edge of Forever"" from ""Naked Time""---if not the whole premise of time travel in a ""Star Trek"" yarn. Also, the Guardian's statement, ""All is as it was,"" was already spoken by the Thasian in ""Charlie X.""""City on the Edge of Forever"" is beautifully written and acted, as has been stated by volumes of fans. Some even give kudos to director Joseph Pevney (who said he intentionally shot this episode in the style of a movie rather than a TV show). However, after perhaps a dozen viewings of ""City"" over several dozen years, it becomes apparent that the MUSIC is also an essential ingredient in its success, and Fred Steiner composed the new cues (using a few old ones by Mullendore and the usual Alexander Courage ""Star Trek"" theme song). Fred Steiner, just as Max Steiner (no relation) did with ""As Time Goes By"" in ""Casablanca"", weaves the theme of ""Good Night, Sweetheart"" into various portions of ""City on the Edge of Forever"" to great effect, even in a minor key in the final portion. Very, very effective blend of audio-visual from many contributors, though screenwriter Harlan Ellison (and script doctor Gene Roddenberry) is usually singled out, and deservedly so.Minor quibbles: watching this episode on DVD without the original commercial interruptions causes the story to progress a bit too quickly. The advertisements actually seem to 'spread out' the progression of time a bit, without which the central love story rolls forward a bit too fast (but we're only talking about a 50 minute episode, folks). Also, it is supposed to take place in New York City of 1930, but the buildings just aren't tall enough. Shatner and guest star Joan Collins even pass by Floyd's barber shop (from ""The Andy Griffith Show""!) in a night scene. Matte paintings to heighten the buildings would have helped.Nevertheless, working with a very limited budget and some very creative people, this absolutely sublime episode captures lightning in a bottle. Watch it and see why.",10
17,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The City on the Edge of Forever (TV Episode 1967)","""Captain's Log - no stardate"".","'The City on the Edge of Forever' ranks near or at the top of most Star Trek fans' fave lists, due in large part I'm sure to Harlan Ellison's original script for the show. I found the episode compelling, mostly because of the poignantly sad ending as Captain Kirk realizes that Edith's death is 'necessary' for the time stream to play itself out properly. Most time travel stories, Star Trek and others, usually manage to maintain that discipline whereby characters are not allowed to influence past or future events.Since most other reviewers touch on this and other aspects of the episode, I'll switch gears to some other observations. I find it very curious that in this one, Dr. McCoy exhibits a lot of the same manic tendencies as the Lazarus character in the preceding episode, 'The Alternative Factor'. Both experience delusions of assassins, annihilation and 'Kill, Kill' that make it seem quite coincidental to have been used in successive airings. In fact, I find this to be quite often the case so far in the first season, where similar elements seem to be repeated. Another example would be the theme of surrendering one's individuality to the cause of a greater good as explored in 'This Side of Paradise' and 'A Taste of Armageddon', two other back to back episodes in the first season.Also, considering that these shows go back four decades now, it's interesting to speculate how they might have been filmed if made today. For example, Kirk and Spock landing on Earth of 2010. How many passers-by on the street would have recorded the event on their cell phones? Talk about affecting the time line.And speaking of Kirk - when speculating about where McCoy might re-enter 1930's Earth, he wonders aloud to Spock where that might happen, mentioning Boise as a possibility among other more renowned cities on the planet. Boise? Would a starship Captain, even someone as sharp as Kirk, recall a place like Boise from the perspective of a few centuries in the future? Fascinating.",9
18,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The City on the Edge of Forever (TV Episode 1967)",Star Trek: The Original Series - City on the Edge of Forever,"While not my personal favorite Trek episode, I do consider it as many, many others to be the greatest of the series. It just simply does everything right. McCoy's accidental hypo injection results in stark raving insanity causing him to beam down to a planet the Enterprise is orbiting which features a time traveling ""guardian"" that shows Kirk, Spock, and the away team their own earth's history. Bones leaps into 30s New York causing time to change, resulting in the upsetting of Earth's history. Kirk and Spock will attempt to interfere with whatever McCoy has done to change time by trying to go to NYC themselves and find him. They meet humanitarian Edith Keeler (the stunning Joan Collins), who runs a soup kitchen, and offers them a place to stay in return for assistance. Spock in NYC is enough to warrant essential viewing, but the Collins and Kirk romance and the tragedy that must befall Keeler, a pacifist who saw a future that Kirk and Spock now live (or hope to again), truly give this episode it's heart. Time travel is sci-fi royalty, always producing the goods. No different here.Having to defy the future where the Nazis win the world war, but make the ultimate sacrifice with love denied him, Kirk's pain is palpable. His overwhelming sadness at the end doesn't leave you after the episode ends. Bones not realizing Kirk's stopping him was crucial to time returning to its place gives extra potency to the awfulness of the situation. Spock having to convince Kirk he must not prevent Keeler's fate, after a near fall down the stairs she almost suffers, you see that this isn't an easy dilemma to circumvent.One of those episodes where casting and good recreation in the sets and wardrobe add great value to the content. From top to bottom, a Cadillac episode of the series. Keeler's speech and how Spock and Kirk listen in silent astonishment, knowing how right she is about the future, and her walking in on Spock while his makeshift radio wave mechanism (developed to ""awaken"" his tricorder and see important details needed to recognize the catalyst in what causes time to change) is in operation are a treat. Kirk trying to explain Spock's ears to a cop while bagladies look on is hilarious.",10
19,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The City on the Edge of Forever (TV Episode 1967)",touching and solid (for the most part),"Spock is a bit too emotional, and more people beam down in one trip than there is space for but other than that this is a pretty solid episode. This is (to my knowledge) star treks first look at altered history or of WWII and they pull it off fabulously. Storyline is as follows: McCoy is shot with something that makes him mad (as in insane) and jumps though what turns out to be a living time machine. Of course he alters history so kirk and spock go back to the approximate date of his arrival to fix things. They arrive early, befriend Edith Keeler, who shares many of their ideals, and kirk falls in love with her. Spock meanwhile is trying to find out what McCoy changed and how to fix it. The first glimpse he gets shows that Edith is involved (and the possibility of her death) but not how. At this time neither kirk nor spock know what caused the change; they only know they need to prevent it. By the time the figure it out, Kirk doesn't think he can go through with it.The episode is especially good because here McCoy has some very good dialog (funny and serious and some that is both) not involving spock! And although spock seems more emotional, he is as logical and dispassionate as ever. kirk on the other hand has quite the battle for values. Most of the drawback comes simply from this being an early episode. They still have some flaws to shake out. But it's all good. 4 out of 5 stars and you can skip the Guardians dialog in my opinion.",7
20,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The City on the Edge of Forever (TV Episode 1967)",Peace actually was not the way.,"This is a fairly decent episode, and in at least one Trek documentary Leonard Nimoy (the famed Commander Spock, first officer of the U.S.S. Enterprise) stated that he was always deeply moved by this episode.I actually do like the episode, so you have to hold onto your seats regarding my review of this episode, and what my comments on the theme are; Time Travel was not often used by the creative forces working on Trek, but an idea used here for a ""what if..."" tale regarding Earth's past (1930's USA). So it is that we get introduced to the Guardian of Forever, who offers a solution to a dilemma. The mood is borderline spooky. There's an etherealness to it just prior to the story proper that sets a very uncertain and almost scary, or frightening kind of mood to the unprepared viewer (non-Trek fan). We're treated to ruins and artifacts of ages past, perhaps of some other world as Kirk and crew search for a lost comrade who may alter the future and their very reality.The story dictates (note; it does not suggest a question, but dictates to the audience) that war was not a solution to the world's political turmoil, save for this one instance in Earth's history. This is something that the viewer really needs to stop and think about. I encourage the viewer to think about the founding of the nation that gave us Star Trek. I encourage the viewer to contemplate freeing the slaves and ending slavery in our nation; to contemplate the expansion of the original thirteen states, and to further contemplate our military interventions elsewhere, and to judge for themselves when and where peace was the right alternative. You might shock yourself.The episode gives us a very beautiful Joan Collins playing a character who has had a calling to help mankind (Joan Collins' own words). Edith Keeler is a ""do gooder"", but she requires a tithe. She's the kind of woman who could have been a model, or married into wealth and set herself up for life, but instead chooses to go into the societal trenches of skid row to see if she can make a difference. To her the world is wondrous, and full of challenges that she is going to face. But is that her fate? Enter the crew of the starship Enterprise, Star Fleet's finest (or will be after her five year mission comes to an end). The unholy psychological trinity of Kirk, Spock and McCoy encounter Earth's past, and as such some very profound changes take place in the crew's attempt to reclaim a colleague who has fallen ill. Will his illness, and his inherit nature, cause a shift in reality? To find out, you have to watch the episode.Captain Kirk is his usual gallant self, and turns on the charm when needed. But will Miss Keeler submit to his masculine wiles? There's a bit of a contest there, and a definite chemistry between the two. We witness it. We see it. We feel it as they look upon one another.Ah, but the harsh reality of the era and why the crew of the Enterprise is there is brought to the fore by the ever implacably logical Mister Spock, who acts as the catalyst and cold hard reminder of why they are there, and what has to be done. He invokes the plot when the romantic story begins to over take the overall story.It's too bad there wasn't double the budget for each episode to add more exterior shots with lots of extras, but the episode works as is. In fact the usual good humor and high drama of the characters presenting us this story is what carries it forward and sustains us throughout.But we have to come back to the story's premise. Again, there is a dictation here, not a question, put to the audience. In essence, without revealing anything, the author, Harlan Ellison flatly states that this is the only time in US history to fight a military conflict of any kind whatsoever. He doesn't ask the audience to consider what would happen, but flat out tells us what happens, and gives us a moral message of how perhaps, according to this episode, someone must be sacrificed to save others. I actually disagree that these are the only options, and I would ask anyone who reads this review to contemplate the story a bit more beyond the commentary offered by Nimoy, Ellison, or any of the other creative team who worked on this episode.In the end Kirk and Spock set things aright, and we head out with them to our next adventure, but not before we get another heady dose of this planet's reality. Again, it is moody, it is surreal, it is an uncertain place that invokes the frightening spirit of ""what if"". It is almost as if we have Charles Dickens' ethereal and unforgiving spirit of Christmas yet to come casting some kind of ethereal contrivance onto this planet to give it its very disquieting atmosphere. For one is given to wonder if the Enterprise and her crew could handle another dilemma posed to them from the one character in this episode who has no heart for the whims of human, but offers them a passage to alter what could be.So in the end I acknowledge the artistry of the episode, but I think it gloss and a sales-pitch for a premise that I disagree with. Or, in Spockanian Vulcan-English; ""There are always alternatives."" Make of that what you will.Enjoy, but do so guardedly.",

This is the one issue that always confounds the time travel stories. When Ray Bradbury wrote his story, ""The Sound of Thunder,"" where a man stepping off a path and crushing a butterfly, caused the entire destruction of what would have been a peaceful, benevolent society, he threw this out there. Going back in time requires incredible imagination for a storyteller. The charm of this story involves the rescue of McCoy versus the budding love affair of Kirk and Keeler.

The crewmen who beamed down to look for McCoy before he used the device remain--as if the time change doesn't affect the planet itself but everything else. So it's up to Spock and Kirk to try to use the device to get there just before McCoy so they can prevent him doing something to change time. The problems are timing this exactly right AND figuring out how he impacted history.Yeah, there seems to be a lot of agreement that this is among the very best (perhaps the best) episodes of the original Star Trek series. And I don't think this is undeserved. Writer Harlen Ellison came up with a dandy script about time travel that is also well-acted and compelling. Guest star Joan Collins is both radiant and a big plus---proving she really could act when she was given a decent script. All in all, a very haunting and moving experience--one not to be missed by anyone--even non-Trekkies.",10
23,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" The City on the Edge of Forever (TV Episode 1967)","He knows Doctor, he knows",One of the best lines in TV history. This episode still gives me chills. If you only watch one episode of Star Trek then make it this one. The relationship between Kirk and Spock make this a great episode. It's humorous in a few spots that will bring a smile to your face and it has its spots where it will bring a tear to your eye. Joan Collins may have been miscast but she pulls it off. This could have easily been a two hour episode because of how much they crammed into 40+ minutes. You'll feel numb after it ends and you will think about it for a long time afterwards but it's a great episode. Must watch TV.,10

(TV Episode 1967)",Bad Day On Deneva,"When the Enterprise arrives at the planet Deneva they discover the population has been attacked by creatures with the ability to control humans using pain as a motivator. There are a number of things to recommend about this episode which, in lesser hands, could easily have turned into just another dull exercise in sci-fi mediocrity. The futuristic architecture of the Denevan capital for one is a fine example of the show's use of outdoor locations. The striking design of the place (which is actually the old TRW Defense & Space Group Campus in Renondo Beach, CA. and thanks to Maverick-154 for that info) is vivid, well constructed and definitely a cut above the usually unconvincing indoor sets that producers so often had to make due with.The alien invaders in the story (resembling some sort of pulsating tumors) are quite repellent, especially with the sound effects enhancement of insect buzzing and repulsive sucking noises. Certainly an unpleasant thing to have landing on you- which is exactly what happens to Mr. Spock here and the viewer feels real sympathy for him as he suffers with the pain of the alien infection. At the same time however we eye him with suspicion as he may just become another unwilling slave to the alien invaders and threaten the safety of the ship. Spock eventually calls upon all the Vulcan will he can muster to contain the alien influence, and here it becomes especially interesting to watch all the little indications of his inner struggle for control. His sporadic facial twitches, an especially stiff gate when he walks, and his fluctuating vocal tones all clearly indicate he's engaged in an internal war. Plus, with Spock being the type of character he is, you understand it's a struggle to maintain personal dignity as well as his self control.Also worth noting is the inclusion in the story of Kirk's sister-in-law, nephew, Peter, and his brother, Sam, the only family members Kirk ever encountered during the 3 year run of the ""Star Trek"" series. Sam- or rather Sam's body as he's already dead when Kirk arrives on the scene- is also played by William Shatner wearing a little mustache.One of the more compelling aspects of this story is the way the characters are faced with making difficult choices that will be costly for some but may accomplish the greater good for all, and this is very much a recurring ""Star Trek"" theme. Unable to find a method of destroying the alien presence on Deneva, Kirk must consider the cold blooded option of annihilating every living thing on the planet (including Spock and his own nephew) in order to keep the aliens from invading other worlds. When they hit upon a method by which they might destroy the creatures with intensely bright light, Spock volunteers to test that method knowing it may come at the cost of his eyesight. This story is not just about icky space creatures. It's also about moral conflict and brave sacrifice, and it's a most interesting episode all around with a terrific emotional payoff that's worth waiting for.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Operation - Annihilate! (TV Episode 1967)","Flying, Buzzing, Telepathic Jellyfish Body Snatchers!","The Enterprise is going to investigate what appears to be a very slow-moving viral form of mass-hysteria which has, over centuries, brought several thriving civilizations on many different planets down. Spock reviews the epidemiology of the phenomenon at the beginning of the episode, revealing that the trajectory of the epidemic places a Federation colony directly in its path. Sam Kirk, his wife and their son, live in this colony.Captain Kirk is directly affected by his family's involvement in all of this, and Shatner does a very nice job of portraying a captain whose professionalism and rational judgment are threatened, and whose usual rational support structure (Spock) is also imperiled and unavailable. In a scene which was, unfortunately underexploited by the mediocre script, Dr. McCoy rises to the occasion and, surprisingly, fills both his usual role and that of the great first officer.Herschel Daugherty directs this memorable episode of TOS, and does an admirable job with a somewhat weak script. The Stephen Carabatsos script creates some problems for the acting (particularly Nimoy, Barrett and Kelley), and - like his previous effort ""Court Martial"" - makes the pace a bit inconsistent. Kelley and Shatner are truly remarkable despite these challenges.The episode also uses setting very nicely, with a very minimal use of backdrops and carefully chosen locations for rare open air shots. Additionally, Spock's character is very nicely examined, the developing rivalry and friendship between McCoy and Spock is enhanced, and the powerful - though unresolved - relationship between Christine Chapel and Spock begins. Finally, this (and the great earlier City on the Edge of Forever)is one of the first episodes to exploit the (unfortunately largely overlooked and unrecognized) subtlety of William Shatner's acting ability by placing Kirk's personal life in the way of his professional practice. This became a major theme as the series continued into its 2nd and 3rd seasons.",7

The art direction here is vivid, well constructed and definitely a cut above the usually unconvincing indoor sets they so often had to make due with.""In fact the location of this episode's set was the old TRW Defense and Space Systems Group campus in Redondo Beach, CA at Avaiation Blvd and Marine Ave (also adjacent, and just N. of old Redondo HS campus) where I used to work in the late 70s. It was called Space Park or Research Park (address was 1 Space Park, RB, CA) back then.

3,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Operation - Annihilate! (TV Episode 1967)",Freaky Flying Alien Things Kill Kirk's Brother,"Call them the flying pizza-things from hell. Or the rubbery suckers from another galaxy. But, whatever you do, don't let one of them attach to your back, sticking you with its alien stinger - you'd be in for some painful days. The final episode of the first season is a straight-out action adventure, a crackerjack alien invasion thriller. It starts out strong, with some ominous mystery on the nature of the threat, escalating to far-out alien monster attack mode. Though hampered by the standard cheesy TV SFX of the sixties, you gotta give the storyline some props for coming up with an unusual alien invader: it's basically a huge brain, but each cell is not physically connected - each cell flies about on its own, causing havoc. The low budget was also unable to show thousands of these things flying around, but that's what must have happened on this colony of Deneva (an actual futuristic city on display here, not just a matte painting - zowie!).There are some clumsy moments in the script and direction as the story jumps along. In one instance, after the landing party hears a woman's scream, Kirk orders everyone to 'fan out!' - but they run grouped close together. But, this is minor compared to some serious lapses in logic later in the episode. Spock, McCoy and everyone in the dozen science labs aboard the starship can't figure out a way to damage these alien suckers after hours of testing, despite being given a great clue by way of the sun; then Kirk idly latches on to a way at the last minute - maybe he was the only one being objective? Then they rush Spock into another test, with Kirk in full agreement, and blind him seconds before McCoy finds out it wasn't necessary. Kirk gives McCoy a 'if-looks-can-kill' stare and stomps out. Incompetence is really spread around in this episode. The writers tried to capitalize on the main trio's established relationship to create some extra tension, but it doesn't really ring true. Even Nurse Chapel becomes uncharacteristically testy during an operation, questioning McCoy on his methods. Well, she did become a doctor herself by the time of ""Star Trek-the Motion Picture""(1979).In a way, the most fitting aspect about this being the last episode of the 1st season is that we're given the only glimpse of Kirk's real family (and its demise), outside the Enterprise. It's not much - Sam Kirk's only appearance is as a corpse and Kirk's sister-in-law dies soon after. Meanwhile, Kirk's nephew remains unconscious the whole time. It would have been nice to see them reunite at the end instead of the now-silly repartee on the bridge, as if Kirk doesn't even remember his dead relatives by this point (contrast this with the superbly grim ending of ""The City on the Edge of Forever""). As mentioned, this is strictly alien invasion thrills, no more. Spock ends up with the best scenes, exerting Vulcan control over the obviously intense pain he suffers. I believe this was the only time Shatner played a character other than Jim Kirk or a Kirk-android or a Kirk impostor during this series. Even though the part was very brief, only as a corpse, he seemed to put every actor's effort into the part.",7
4,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Operation - Annihilate! (TV Episode 1967)",Attack of the Flying Space Pancakes,"This was always one of my favorite episodes as a kid: The Enterprise crew investigates an epidemic of ""space madness"" and traces the latest outbreak to a local human colony that just happens to be where Kirk's identical twin brother has been assigned as a research scientist. The fun really begins when it becomes apparent what the alien menace is, which are an invasion of flying interstellar space pancakes that make up a collective gestalt creature looking to spread it's way across the galaxy. It needs humanoids who can fly space ships to spread from colony to colony, and Kirk has to face the decision of his career when choosing between whether or not to just go back to the Sulaco and nuke them all from orbit. It's the only way to be sure ...Just kidding. This was one of our favorite Star Trek adventures to act out when we were kids because you could use a bean bag as the pretend space pancake and smack each other on the back, beaming it with your wooden shop class phaser to save each other. The architecture in the city is also pretty rad, looks a lot like the State University at Albany campus I used to study at, which lo and behold was built at about the same time that the actual location (some sort of aerospace company's campus center) was made. It's a great episode for Spock and McCoy fans too, they have more to do than usual which may have been the result of Leonard Nimoy's surprise popularity with fans writing in -- much to the chagrin of William Shatner, who considered himself the focus of the show and resented any major actions that didn't center on Captain Kirk.This one doesn't, and so it sort of sticks out. One of the best of the ""overlooked episodes"", and actually rather violent & filled with more physical suffering than usual for Star Trek.",8
5,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Operation - Annihilate! (TV Episode 1967)","""You've been so concerned about his Vulcan eyes Doctor, you forgot about his Vulcan ears"".","While re-watching the entire series in episode order, and now that the first season has come to an end, I have to comment on something that's bugged me from the start. You would think that with thirty second century technology, the Federation would have been able to figure out how to construct an ergonomically comfortable work station for Uhura. Even Spock chooses to stand when he has to make one of his calculations, probably figuring it's not worth the effort to pull over a chair. Every time I see Uhura splayed across the communications console, it drives me crazy that they couldn't have built a work station that might have been practical. Of course if they had done that, you wouldn't have been able to track how Uhura's skirt shrank with each successive episode, to the point here of being virtually even with her waist. Check it out - in the earliest stories, her skirt was somewhat above the knees, but gradually went higher and higher throughout the first season.Now for the story. Up till now, the cheesiest Star Trek monster would have been that Horta from 'The Devil in the Dark'. Well he still might be the cheesiest, but these goofy flying amoeba-like looking discs looked a lot more scary back in the Sixties before I had a chance to catch the show in color. Someone else on this board had it right about their resembling those plastic barf toys you could fool your friends with back in the day. In fact, the first time I saw someone pull that on me as a kid, I thought THAT was pretty real compared to these things.The concept behind the story was pretty good though, a mass wave of insanity spreading across the galaxy and wiping out civilizations. Captain Kirk's only known family falls victim here without too much fanfare, and it would have probably meant more if his brother Sam's character had been developed over the course of the season. He was mentioned once before, but that was your only inkling that he might show up one day. When he does, he's already a goner. Oh well.You know, sometimes the resolution to these unsolvable problems is something so simple it should have been thought of before. Just as in ""War of the Worlds"" where the invaders are brought down by common bacteria, the alien brain and the flying barf-rays are done in by, who would have guessed - bright light. The resolution provides for some momentary angst over the loss of Spock's eyesight, but you just knew this was all going to work out alright. Good thing about that Vulcan inner eye lid.",7
6,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Operation - Annihilate! (TV Episode 1967)",Pretty good,"I thought this episode was reasonably well done and competent. Nothing spectacular, but a solid story overall and much better than some of the other first season episodes (like ""Charlie X"" and ""The Enemy Within"").The premise is that alien beings, who resemble gigantic brain cells, have spread like a plague, attaching themselves to humans and controlling their nervous systems. The dilemma is figuring out how to eliminate the aliens without killing the human hosts.This episode got a little extra mileage than usual from two emotional elements-- Kirk's family is involved (his brother's family), and Spock is also put in mortal danger. Spock's ""infection"" turns out to be a sort of blessing in disguise, as it allows the Enterprise crew to more directly study the nature of the aliens.My only minor complaint is that there was no attempt of any sort made to communicate with the aliens. I understand that they were hostile and dangerous, and perhaps it was indeed a ""kill or be killed"" situation, but negotiation wasn't even explored as an option. I thought it should at least have been tried. Was it because the aliens don't ""look"" humanoid, or some other recognizable form? Even the brutal man-creatures in ""Galileo Seven"" were given more respect than these creatures.",7

Yes, they do have to stop a madness plague of sorts spreading from planet to planet via these creatures who look like that fake rubber vomit you could buy out of the back of comic books when you were a kid, but ""Operation: Annihilate!""? Really? Starts off pretty strong, with the planet in question being home to Kirk's Brother and his wife and young son. Kirk is naturally in ""To Hell with protocols"" mode in an effort to reach his family, and that's always been my favorite Kirk. The middle section gets a bit wonky, with the crew hunting down the critters at what looks like a So-Cal Community College before setting up the episode's strong suit; Spock. Specifically, Leonard Nimoy. Spock is infected with one of the vomit aliens, who cause such great pain as to drive their hosts mad. Spock naturally uses his Vulcan half to control his emotions, even under extreme pain, and this provides Nimoy something to really sink his teeth into. I don't know if Nimoy was a great actor, but he is certainly great in the role of Spock and clearly relishes the opportunity to do more than arch his eyebrow and deliver pseudo-scientific babble.Kirk's solution is a bit too deus ex machina, but this rather flimsy episode is held together thanks mostly to Nimoy's strong performance.",6

It also just so happens that Kirk's brother, sister-in-law, and nephew reside on Deneva. It turns out that the insanity has already reached the population. Kirk's brother & sister-in-law die; his nephew is hanging on by a thread. The crew discovers that the virus is spread via strange flying manta ray-like creatures that latch onto its victims and sting them. Spock gets bit but due to his Vulcan pedigree is able to mentally fend off the creatures enough to maintain control of himself. After much experimentation, it is discovered that the creatures hate direct sunlight. But it will require a lot of it. Spock is cured but temporarily blinded. The Enterprise uses local satellites to flash the surface with the light, destroying the creatures and putting everything back to normal.So are we just going to forget about the nephew then? Okay screenwriters... We never see him and Kirk reunited. Instead we end the season with some gentle ribbing. Kirk doesn't even seem affected anymore by his brother's death. It all felt like a very sloppy conclusion. Making Spock blind for 8 seconds didn't really feel necessary either.Besides this though, it's an okay episode. It's got a decent amount of action but the dialogue and plot is a bit clunky at times. My favorite aspect of it was watching Kirk wrestle with the consideration that he may need to destroy the entire planet (his nephew & Spock included) in order to stop the virus from spreading further. That's a heavy cross to bear and you can feel the relief from Kirk when he doesn't need to exercise this option.Note: This is kind of in the same category as the Borg since the amoeba-like creatures seem to share a hive-like mind. Just thought that was an interesting tidbit...",6
9,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Operation - Annihilate! (TV Episode 1967)",A personal favourite,"Various colonies have been lost due to outbreaks of mass insanity and Deneva, where Kirk's brother and his family live, is next in line. The Enterprise heads there to investigate but they get no reply from the surface; it would appear they are too late. One person fled Deneva but he didn't last long; he flew his ship directly into the sun, claiming to be free just before he was killed. Kirk leads an away party to the surface and finds his brother dead and his sister in-law and nephew are infected. He takes them back to the Enterprise were she manages to speak of what sounds like an invasion before dying. Back on the planet strange creatures are discovered; they are immune to phaser fire and one attacks Spock. They return to the Enterprise where Spock is treated; the creature and injected something into him which has become entwined with his nervous system; causing great pain whenever he resists. Using his Vulcan pain control methods he manages to keep working as they struggle to discover a way of destroying the creatures; the only clue being the final words of the man who flew into the sun if they can't find a solution Kirk will have to eliminate the planet's population of over a million to stop it spreading!This episode has always been a personal favourite possibly because I remember seeing it as a child and being rather scared by it! The creature effects might be a bit cheap and cheerful but they are effective. The idea of creatures taking over a person in such a painful way is enjoyably unpleasant and the idea that each of the creatures is actually a cell in a larger creature is interesting. Using a real location for the futuristic city on Deneva rather than a set or painted backdrop makes the setting more believable. The moral dilemma presented to Kirk makes things more interesting than just having a creature that must be destroyed to protect the ship or some people. The ultimate solution is nicely linked to the opening scenes although the way Spock survived unharmed thanks to a previously unmentioned Vulcan characteristic is certainly an example of deus ex machina although it was necessary to raise the tension without losing such a fine character. The cast do a solid job; especially Leonard Nimoy who does a fine job portraying Spock's attempts to overcome the pain the creature is inflicting. Overall a pretty good episode.",8

The audience is posed with Kirk and Spock trying to unravel the mystery of an alien collective intelligence that enslaves infected hosts to do their bidding (think the Soviet Union here).The theme here is designed to illustrate the slavery that the collective mentality imposes on the human condition. One might find themselves tempted to look up ancient Greek philosophy to explore some of the deeper allegories that are cleverly coded and illustrated in this episode. Note the beginning and the ultimate solution near the end.Production value wise the creative forces knew they had a turkey when it came to their alien of the week, and so addressed that aspect in some of the dialog from one of the landing party crew members. Otherwise it superbly acted (as are the super-majority of this 1960's gem TV show), and the story, if one is sharp and well educated enough, should strike a chord for anyone who's felt the heel of of an oligarchical power.",

Sam is dead, and soon the madness takes his wife when she attempts to tell Kirk what happened to them. Even worse is when Kirk and the away team find blob-like flying creatures which attach to people, inserting a stinger that infiltrates their mind and body, enforcing their will, causing the madness...with one of them landing on Spock's back, stinging him! And, it gets even worse: Kirk must find out what can kill the creatures, destroy their influence on host organisms, or else possibly have to annihilate the colonists before the creatures spread out of this galaxy elsewhere! The planet, Deneva, needs Kirk and Bones, with Spock fighting what wants control inside him having went to the surface again to retrieve a creature for study, to get an answer. The sun plays a unique role in this answer as a ship from Deneva traveled right into it with the captain of the vessel speaking about being free...it is so bizarre when first seen at the beginning of the episode but later proves valuable. The plot makes great use of Spock - Spock battling the madness of the stinger coursing inside him while trying to figure out how to defeat them, including losing his sight during a ""light experiment"" and nearly disrupting operations on the Bridge before being taken down by multiple officers! Again, to face such developments, Kirk is lucky he didn't endure anxiety attacks and constant stress evaluations! The ingenuity and cerebral analyzing that is needed to escape so many perils; this show thrived on how Kirk and company would combat such situations as the one on Deneva.

Whereas shows in the 1950s and early 1960s focused on Western and Variety themes, Star Trek introduced mind-bending plots and alien (literally!) concepts to viewers.This show focuses on the mission the U.S.S. Enterprise and her crew as they explore the vast regions of the galaxies (or show creator Gene Roddenberry's very creative imagination!). The main characters include William Shatner as the swashbuckling Captain James T. Kirk, Leonard Nimoy as First Officer Spock (a human/Vulcan mix) and Deforest Kelly as Chief Medical Officer Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy. There also exists a strong ensemble cast (whom I will not mention here individually) that support the ""main three"" in various episodes.As I mentioned earlier, by exploring the ""distant reaches of the galaxy"", Gene Roddenberry was able to introduce new and thought-provoking concepts into the minds of his viewers, who would then tune in again the next week to see what mind-bending adventure was in store for them. Though each individual episodes have their own supporters and critics, here are a few of my favorites of this First Season:The Enemy Within: Kirk's consciousness is split into dual personalities...one evil, one docile. Which will ultimately prevail?Shore Leave: Strange things begin to happen on the crew's vacation. (This episodes showcases the comedic presence of the entire cast brilliantly!).Space Seed: The Enterprise encounters a ruthless dictator from another world.The City On The Edge of Forever: When McCoy travels back in time and alters the entire course of history, the Enterprise crew must also go back and set things straight.To conclude, as a kid I loved this show because of its action/adventure plotlines. As a more seasoned TV viewer, I can now appreciate the show for being the first vehicle in which certain plot devices were ever used in TV drama. If you are a seasoned sci-fi viewer who wants to relive the ""good old days"", or a sci-fi newbie who wants to start ""from the beginning"", this is the perfect show for you!",10

Oddly, you do wonder why the Enterprise could figure all this out so quickly and yet the folks on the planet were totally screwed! This is an episode that seems to be aired less often than average--perhaps because it is a pretty weak one with a few plot problems. The creatures were pretty cheesy and the plot not terribly exciting, but probably the biggest shortcoming of the show is the gimmicky way they resolved the ending of the film when Spock was blinded when trying to kill off the space barf that had infested him.

Amazing, how, in all the thousands of people, Kirk manages to find his dying relatives on this miserable little planet! It looks like it was filmed at an old office building! (It was!) Otherwise a fair story, but so similar to too many ""B"" grade sci-fi and ""Outer Limits"" stories. A terrible end to Season 1. A terrible title as well. As usual, not enough ""extras"" populate either the Starship or the planet, to make it all seem more ""real"".",7
19,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Operation - Annihilate! (TV Episode 1967)",OK episode,"But, why, oh why did they insist on close-ups of those RIDICULOUS, cheesy-looking blobs!!!! Almost ruined the whole episode. If you are going to have cheesy special effects, no close-ups should be allowed!!!!!!",7
20,"""Star Trek: The Original Series"" Operation - Annihilate! (TV Episode 1967)","there's something wrong, jim..","Star TrekOperation - AnnihilateA cultural hub and by far one of the most loved and respected tale, Star Trek is created by Gene Roddenberry who wrote this brilliant concept, ahead of its time and is probably why it still doesn't fail to entertain us after these many years. It was written ""for the future"" in many aspects as it even though is smarter, wiser and powerful it still seeks for emotion and the force that binds it all. The relation between Spock and Kirk; despite of its premise, is the most human thing in this majestic tale where the adventures are endless. Encountering this original series, at this stage makes the execution look petty and a bit loose (the small technical aspects can be negotiated) but the writing is smart, gripping and hence completely overpowers it. Unlike any other hit series, it only has 3 seasons so luckily it means that they will be covering up all their ideas within it until they are satisfied. As it often happens, the first season is always promising and has potential (or else it won't lift up for further more seasons) in it and is utilized with fine detailed work like focusing on different new breeds and characters bonding through this journey.There was no such finale episode drama or cliffhanger, they just focused on another one of their mission focusing on Spock this time and him surviving and defeating the vulnerabilities that he suffers in this episode and how he surpasses them.",
