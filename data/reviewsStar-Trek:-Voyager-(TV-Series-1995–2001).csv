0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Unimatrix Zero: Part II (TV Episode 2000)",A good start to the final season,"As season Six came to an end things were not looking good for Janeway, Tuvok and B'Elanna; it looked like their plans to infiltrate the Borg cube had failed and the three of them had been assimilated. We soon learn that this was all part of the plan to give them full access to the cube and that they have been inoculated so they won't become part of the collective for a few hours. As their deadline approaches Tuvok finds himself being drawn into the collective. When the virus is released it has the desired effect; freeing members of Unimatrix Zero from the collective. By the time this has been done however Tuvok has been assimilated and the other two are captured. In an effort to force Janeway to tell her how to cure the virus the Borg Queen shows her just how far she will go to kill off the freed drones leaving Janeway with a dilemma.Season Seven certainly got off to a good start with plenty of action, an interesting moral dilemma for the captain and a surprise or two that I won't spoil here. Guest star Susanna Thompson did a good job as the Borg Queen; managing to appear friendly and threatening at the same time.",9
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Unimatrix Zero: Part II (TV Episode 2000)",How'd That All Happen?,"The Borg queen is bent on keeping things her way. It's interesting. She is really an individual, thinking pretty much for herself. When she is in combat with Janeway, it appears that her reasons are personal. She is at the center in decision making, hence, individual. This is a good episode with a lot of close calls. One advantage is that the Borg have enemies throughout the galaxy, and so finding comrades is not so hard. One problem with this series is the Doctor's ability to seemingly come up with devices and substances to counter almost anything.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Unimatrix Zero: Part II (TV Episode 2000)",An excellent finale.,"This is the second of a two-part episode involving the Borg. In episode one, Voyager learns that there is a virtual world called Unimatrix One where a small number of Borg drones can somehow live during their time recharging in the alcove. In other words, during these sleeping hours, they live as non-drones in a happy world. Because they have individuality during this time, the Borg queen ain't happy and is determined to find this place and wipe everyone out.By this episode, Voyager is not only encouraging the drones in Unimatrix One but is trying to find a way to get the drones to become individuals during waking hours as well. That way the hive can be destabliized. However, Janeway isn't content with JUST destabilization--she's hoping that they can destroy this hive. To do so, she and some other crew members allow themselves to join the Collective! How can they do this and maintain their individuality? See the show...and the thrilling finale.Excellent. Violent, creative and deliciously evil--this one is a show to see!",10
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Unimatrix Zero: Part II (TV Episode 2000)",A Borg Civil War,"Beta Borg Queen Suzanna was the happiest Borg Queen of them all, she has successfully assimilated not only Kathryn Janeway but B'Elanna Torres and Tuvok to boot.So why can't she hear these valuable new acquisitions? She had monologued in the Cliffhanger of the last episode that she expected something ""More Cunning"" from Janeway.Well, if she knew what Janeway was really up to, she would have been satisfied. Janeway had found a way to be assimilated but keep her Hooman Identity intact and avoid being sucked into the Collective.Because Janeway, Tuvok and B'Elanna had been ""Assimilated for Bear"", each of them containing NanoViruses that will hide all of the Borg with the Mutation that allows them to get into Unimatrix Zero. Their Goal? Just walk right into the Central Plexus and use The Borg's own Assimilation Tubules to inject the NanoVirus into the Plexus.And it works great, except for this one flaw: They did not give Tuvok enough of the Dope that is preventing the three of them from being completely assimilated.Big Problem, Suzie-Queen can now hear Tuvok, and has his Tactical Access Codes to Voyager.Meanwhile Seven of Inverted-Nine-and-Nine goes back to Unimatrix Zero to monitor when the NanoVirus is dispersed. She had found out that she had been part of Unimatrix Zero for 19 years, six of them in an Intimate Relationship with Axum. This makes her uncomfortable and difficult to do her Job, Chakotay has to order her to go in there and set that difficulty aside.Starfleet has No Tolerance for interpersonal Problems- This is not the first time a Crew Person has been Ordered to do their Job despite not liking it. If The Senate in 2013 had been Starfleet Officers, they never would have tried to shut down the Government, holding the entire government Hostage. Can you imagine if the Maquis Members of Voyager's Crew had decided to perform a ""Voyager Shut-Down?"" - Janeway would have hung each of them from the Highest Yardarm (Or Starboard Engine Nacelle).So Seven sets her discomfort aside and gets involved with the people in Unimatrix Zero, helping them set Traps for Unwelcome Drones, and even falls into one of Axum's Traps. This was the perfect thing to happen, it forced Annika Hansen aka Seven to face the subject of her discomfort: Axum (Mark Deakins who does a lot of memorable work for LDS).She even gets Korok interacting and cooperating with the rest of the members of Unimatrix, and Korok gives Bat'Tehl's to whoever wants to try using them. Axum was given a nice, spiky club that would also do the trick.Janeway is successful in planting the NanoVirus, but not before Tuvok is assimilated, and gives Beta Queen their access codes, Voyager has to Haul Arse out of there in short order.And the Queen now sees the Virus and Mutates it to backfire, intending to plant it right into Unimatrix Zero, killing all of the Matrix Drones.So Janeway is forced to ""Compromise"" to Suzanna Queen, and tells Chakotay that ""Unimatrix Zero must not exist""- This secret Message goes over Suzanna's Head.And Voyager has some unlikely Help: It appears that Korok's Sphere is near Voyager, between his Sphere and Voyager, they destroy Unimatrix Zero and The Queen's opportunity to kill them all.But now, the Drones can remember who they were in Unimatrix Zero, and The only way for The Queen to eradicate these drones is to destroy the entire collective.Annika/Seven and Axum have a parting Scene, she will never meet him because he in in a Ship orbiting Fluidic Space in the Beta Quadrant. But Janeway's s parting words to B-Queen are ""I Don't compromise with Borg"".Mark Deakins is also in ""Star Trek: Insurrection"" - He is on a Roof yelling out some instructions while Picard evacuates a Baku Village.",10
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Imperfection (TV Episode 2000)",Seven Of Nine faces death.,"Voyager. Season 7, Episode 2. ""Imperfection"" Seven Of Nine faces death.Absolutely superb.There are many, many things to love here.1. Most of the screen time is devoted to the show's three best characters: Seven, Janeway and The Doctor. But it's not just that they get lots of screen time, it's that they get lots of good screen time. For instance, there's a wonderful, emotional moment between Janeway and Seven that is a huge step forward in their relationship/friendship (and it's perfectly played by Jeri Ryan and the amazing Kate Mulgrew). Impossible to watch this exchange and not feel tears forming. And it's a scene that is typical of many in the story.2. It's an emotional episode, all round. Seven's scene with Janeway is probably the best, but the final scene with Icheb is also a killer and the scene with B'Elanna is another one likely to generate a tear or two. And there's more. It's a very powerful episode, very sad and affecting. Uplifting and wonderful in the way that this show frequently is. Voyager's skill, indeed the gift that the Star Trek legacy gives it, is the ability to write on-the-nose about big topics and make it palatable. Seven might die. And it gives her pause to think and, eventually, talk about it. And it's epic stuff.3. There's some cool Janeway action. The episode (wisely) takes a break from all the stuff likely to make you cry and drops Janeway, Tuvok and Paris into the middle of a battle where Janeway jumps an imposing alien and holds him at gunpoint (sorta). It's fun stuff. Typical of Janeway when she chooses to wear her bad ass hat.4. It's funny. After seven seasons is there any need to say it? But, anyway... Robert Picardo is worth his weight in gold. Many of The Doctor's utterance's are hilarious. Usually, in scenes with Seven e.g. Seven's joke about her 'last meal'.5. The core values of Star Trek are in display in spades, here. Janeway's attempt to head off on a dangerous mission alone is scuppered by Tuvok and Paris in fine style, and once again we see that these people are a team through and through.6. Manu Intiraymi is a curious performer. Sometimes I find his delivery stilted and over-earnest. Yet, in all the scenes where it really mattered he totally nailed it. Totally. All his scenes from the last third of the episode are A+ material. It's taken 5 episodes, but I really like the guy now.ABriefingWithMichael.blogspot.com",10
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Imperfection (TV Episode 2000)",Excellent Acting/Touching Episode,"This is a really touching episode. The unflappable Seven is suddenly made aware of her mortality. She begins to have fears of leaving the earth unloved and worthless. Ichab is her salvation, but unfortunately she has quite the ego and falls into depression. For all practical purposes, she gives up. She can't ask for help because her Borg heritage is still holding on to her. The final scenes are very dramatic and uplifting.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Imperfection (TV Episode 2000)",Awfully good.,"This episode makes very good use of the Borg kids--specifically Icheb. When the show begins, one more of the Borg kiddies is reunited with their parents and Seven is seen crying. Unfortunately it's NOT because of a sudden appearance of emotion but because an important part of Seven's Borg implants is malfunctioning. It's a problem because without it, she will die. An attempt to replace it with a Borg node doesn't work so there is only one possible option--but the Doctor and Seven are loathe to try it. Icheb offers to give her his node. This probably won't kill him, as apparently he wasn't fully assimilated since he's a kid and his body SHOULD be able to survive without it. This is a very emotional and enjoyable show. I liked the moral quandary in this one and the show is quite memorable.",9
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Imperfection (TV Episode 2000)",Seven malfunctions,"After three of the four Borg children leave Voyager Icheb notices that Seven of Nine is crying, she claims that it is due to her ocular implant malfunctioning and initially the Doctor believes she is just trying to cover the fact that she showed emotion at saying good bye to the children but a check up reveals that there was indeed a malfunction. Initially Seven wants the Doctor to keep her problem secret but when she collapses it becomes apparent that her cortical node is failing and that if it isn't replaced she will die. Not being able to replicate the part Janeway leads an away mission in the recently repaired Delta Flyer to a destroyed Borg cube to retrieve the part from a dead drone. Unfortunately simulations show that the part is of no use and they need the part from a live Borg. When a possible solution is suggested neither Seven nor the Doctor are initially enthusiastic.While not as exciting as the season opener this episode had a good action scene where the captain retrieves the part of the dead drone and some nice moral ambiguity when Janeway suggests finding a live drone and taking its node.",7
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Drive (TV Episode 2000)",A good idea that suffers from choppy presentation...,"(SPOILERS) The idea of a ""race in space"" has never been introduced in the Star Trek Universe before, and so there was great opportunity in ""Drive"" for a truly exciting and unique Trek adventure. Unfortunately, the end result, while not terrible, falls far short of its potential.The main fault seems to be too many subplots (the race, warring factions & sabotage, AND Tom & B'Elanna's relationship problems), which require the viewer to constantly jump from one to another to the extent that one feels almost as if one is watching three different episodes at the same time instead of just one. In trying to be many things, ""Drive"" fails to by any ONE thing, and so the show ends up with a ""choppy"" and jumbled feel to it.I, for one, would have loved to have seen more emphasis on the race itself- the individual racers, the bizarre vehicles they were piloting, the potential unknown hazards along the race course, etc. (The pod race in ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" (1999) is a great example of how visually interesting- not to mention fun & exciting- a multiple species space race can be).Finally, I was rather disappointed that a major Star Trek Voyager event- the marriage of Tom Paris & B'Elanna Torres- happened off screen and was somewhat haphazardly tacked on at the very end! What's up with that? One would think that the marriage of these two major characters would deserve at least a token amount of screen time.Perhaps ""Drive"" would have worked better with a little more ""breathing space""- as a two part story arc, there would have been more time to explore & develop all the subplots. As it stands, it seems a little rushed & out of focus.",5
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Drive (TV Episode 2000)","Tom, the man-child, enters a race.","This episode is very reminiscent of the Star Wars movie where young Aniken Skywalker is in some sort of hovercraft race. Here, it's much the same sort of thing but the race is in space. However, Tom Paris is flying this craft--so the pilot is clearly someone LESS mature than Aniken!When the show begins, Tom meets a kindred spirit who loves to speed about in a shuttle. She informs him that her race and three others are having a big race to celebrate peace--and Paris is welcome to join in if he'd like. However, selfish Tom totally forgets that he's been promising B'Elanna for ages that he'd take her to the holodeck for a little vacation! Oops. This sort of thoughtlessness gets B'Elanna wondering if she really should remain with the man- child, Tom.Talk about light-weight plots! A race?! Still, it plays reasonably well but ends on a very unhappy ending--B'Elanna agrees to actually marry that schmuck! But I DID like the final scene of them in the shuttle--it's kind of cute.",6
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Drive (TV Episode 2000)",A race and relationships,"While out testing upgrades to the Delta Flyer Tom and Harry get involved in an informal race with an alien woman called Irina. It turns out that she is on her way to rally and suggests that Tom should enter in the Flyer. Captain Janeway readily accepts his request to take part thinking it will help crew moral. One person who is not so pleased is B'Elanna who had been looking forward to a holodeck holiday with Tom which she had spent some time arranging. Trying to save their relationship she persuades Harry to let her take his place in the race. After an audacious manoeuvre the Delta Flyer finishes the first stage in the lead although it might have caused an accident that injured Irina's copilot. It turned out it wasn't the Flyer that caused the accident but an act of sabotage. In the final leg Harry takes over as Irina's copilot largely because he has a bit of a crush on her. Once again something goes wrong with her ship and Harry realises why; she sabotaged it herself so that she would be well away from the finish line when the other ship she sabotaged exploded... that other ship being the Delta Flyer.This wasn't a bad episode and I enjoyed the idea of the Flyer taking part in a race it could have given us excitement without an antagonist or great peril; it was a pity that instead we got a clichéd plot featuring sabotage, it was also a bit of a shame that during what should have been an exciting climax we got a rather soapy scene between Tom and B'Elanna. The final scene where we see the words ""Just Married"" written on the Delta Flyer was pretty corny but earned a chuckle.",6
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Drive (TV Episode 2000)",Boooooring!,At no point did I have even the slightest interest in this epiode. I am so bored when Tom does his 1950's motor head stuff. Why not just play Fonzie in Happy Days. The other thing that is also incredibly boring is his relationship with B'Lanna. Their constant snuggling and shows of affection just become tiresome. I find them both tedious when they are together. Really weak episode.,4
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Repression (TV Episode 2000)",Who is attacking the Maquis?,"This was an interesting episode which started off much like a classic murder mystery, although the victims were being put into comas rather than being killed. The victims are all former members of the Maquis leading to a sense of paranoia amongst the remaining members. Tuvok who is in charge of the investigation makes a starling discovery; it turns out that the assailant had no idea that he was responsible, a message from home had triggered mind control programming which had been initiated years ago in the Alpha Quadrant. As the victims begin to wake from their comas and hear a trigger phase they seize control of the ship with the intention of abandoning the Star Fleet crew on a nearby planet; will any of them manage to break their programming before it is too late.I liked how this episode changed as it went along, I was expecting it to be a simple whodunit but we learnt who was responsible about half way through. Even though the attacker is revealed before the half way point I won't reveal who it was here as I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.",8
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Repression (TV Episode 2000)",Nigh unwatchable,"A lot of people consider the season 2 episode where Paris and Janeway turn into space slugs, hook up, and pop out a couple of space slug kids as the worst episode of Voyager, and even Star Trek history, but they obviously never made it far enough to watch this steaming pile of crap.We start off with some Bajoran witch doctor putting some space voodoo on Voyager, then immediately to the ""comic"" relief in which Mr. and Mrs. Tom Paris go on a date night to a 3D movie theater. On the holodeck. The irony is not lost on B'Lanna, who comments that it seems silly to watch two-dimensional technology using three-dimensional holographic equipment. Not seems, Mrs. Paris, IS. IS SILLY. The most sophisticated entertainment system ever created, and little Tommy Paris uses it to watch 400-year-old movies. That's like using my playstation to watch...well, nothing, because entertainment wasn't even invented until the 20th century.Back to Voyager - seems as if someone is attacking seemingly random crew people until it's revealed that it's not random, there's a pattern - they're all former Maquis! Hey, remember that thing that stopped being an issue in Season One? Nope, me either.It's been SEVEN YEARS. Why bother reminding the audience of a storyline so long-abandoned, so mundane, even the characters didn't care about it anymore?Somehow it's revealed that the Bajoran witch doctor is some kind of Dr. Mindbender, who did a bunch of experiments on Tuvok because he was jealous that the Maquis kicked him out of their club. What?! Why does any of this matter? Seven years ago, it might have mattered. This feels like another ""Friday Before A Holiday Weekend"" episode, where the writers just found whatever resembled a story and made them shoot it the next week.Shameful. Anyway, the Bajoran has been using Tuvok to mind-meld with the Maquis people, of which Chakotay states is about 1/4 of Voyager's crew. On the high side, Voyager has 150 crew people, so that makes around 32 Maquis. After Tuvok's mind-melds, all of the FORMER Maquis (because remember, THIS DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE) become all crazy mind-controlled and stage an insurrection, taking over Voyager. Why? Why is any of this happening? Turns out no one knows or cares. Best part? When Evil Maquis Chakotay tells Evil Maquis Tuvok that they still had around 21 of their people who didn't get the mind-meld, so they can't help. 21 of 32 are not helping them. That leaves 11. Eleven former Maquis took over all of Voyager without any pushback. More than 11 people get sick after eating Neelix's cooking on a nightly basis.All this stupidity ends when Janeway tells Tuvok to remember who he is, and then he does and something happens, the end.Just a dumb, dumb, useless episode. Which is a shame, because it started out really great with a Ten Little Indians kind of feel with the crew getting attacked one at a time.Eleven people. Give me a break. They even changed out of their Starfleet uniforms after they took over the ship. So, outmatched around 12-1, the Maquis jerkwads find a way to take the ship and stop by their apartments to change their clothes in the process.Poo. Utter poo. 2/10 and only because of that horror movie vibe that died around 10 minutes in.",2
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Repression (TV Episode 2000)",Kinda weird but pretty good,"Something odd is happening. Several crew members who were members of the Maquis have been attacked and are found in comas. They don't die and actually eventually recover but they have no idea who is responsible. Mr. Tuvok is in charge of investigating the matter and his results are VERY disturbing, as apparently some evil piggy used one of the letters sent through the pulsar in order to brainwash a crew member to do all this. Why? What is the ultimate goal? This is a pretty good episode overall. However, I did laugh when Tom Paris and the crew were all doing a recreation night where they sat and watched 3-D movies from the 1950s. This technology was CRAP and it's funny that the writer of the show didn't realize that the 3-D films which would come only a decade after the show aired actually DID look 3-D. In fact, my daughter and I love seeing all the 24th century gadgets that actually are possible NOW or in the very near future!",7
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Repression (TV Episode 2000)",Slightly Better Than Spock's Brain,"So many plot holes. Such a ridiculous premise. This two bit Manchurian Candidate plot goes nowhere. When we FINALLY get to the climax, most people would already be asleep. The old Maquis rebellion rears its head. Of course, Tuvok using only Vulcan evidence to solve a murder mystery (where no one has been murdered) is kind of interesting. I can't think of anything to say. Just awful.",2

He is understandable not happy that his program and mobile emitter were stolen but can't ignore the suffering of the many patients. After treating a few people he finds himself summoned from the Red Level he is on to the Blue Level; what he finds there shocks him; here there are a handful of patients with no real illness being given the drugs that are desperately needed by those on Red Level. He is told that the people on Red Level are deemed to be less important to the society. In an attempt to help Tebbis, one of the Red patients he takes medicine from the Blue Level, after a success he tries to help everybody there, unfortunately when the authorities find out they withdraw all the medication and Tebbis dies. Forced to stay on Blue Level the Doctor takes drastic action which puts the hospital's administrator in danger. While the Doctor is off Voyager the crew spend time looking for the trader and then Tuvok and Neelix use interrogation techniques that probably breech several Star Fleet protocols.This was an enjoyable episode with a nice moral dilemma. As usual Robert Picardo did a great job as The Doctor. There were also notable guest performances from Larry Drake as the administrator and Gregory Itzin as the doctor in charge of Blue Level who comes around to support The Doctor.",8

It seems someone stole his program and holo emitter and sold it! Until he can be rescued, he has to make the best of it. However, it's soon apparent that he's on a hellish planet and the medical treatment is allocated according to how beneficial you are to society. In other words, if you have a red designation, you get very little treatment--even if it isn't very expensive. But, if you're a blue, then you are in luck!I liked this commentary on health care--it has a lot of parallels to today and I am sure the writer intended this. In addition, it's a dandy episode and you'll like the way Neelix deals with the thief. And, if you do watch it, look for Larry Drake (a regular on ""LA Law"" and in the ""Darkman"" films) as well as Jim O'Heir (Larry/Gerry/Terry/Gary from ""Parks and Recreation) in one of his first roles. He's under a lot of make-up--so listen for his voice as he plays a man crying about losing his wife.",8

Barclay bringing news that there is a way that will enable the crew to get home in a few days by passing through a ""geodesic fold"". Janeway points out that they have considered doing this before but rejected the idea as the radiation levels would kill the crew. Holographic Reg reassures them that with changes to the shields and an inoculation they would all be safe.Back on Earth the real Reg believes that his messages have failed to get through, probably because it has been stolen by the Borg or the Romulans. This leaves the viewer wondering if one of these races has stolen the hologram and reprogrammed it before sending it onto Voyager or it got through as intended and Reg is wrong about it being lost. After he is told to take some leave Reg goes and finds Counselor Troi who isn't too pleased to be disturbed on her holiday. She agrees to a quick talk and comes to the conclusion that Reg might be right about the program being stolen when he mentions having had a girl friend who left him just after the hologram's program was lost. It turns out she was working for a group of Ferengis who are trying to get their hands on Seven of Nine's nanoprobes. The crew of Voyager are mostly oblivious that they are about to get killed meaning Reg must persuade the Ferengis to collapse the fold before Voyager can enter it.Initially I thought I wouldn't enjoy this episode as the Holographic Reg was so extremely confident as to be annoying but it is explained well enough. It was a nice twist to have the Ferengis be the antagonists rather than anybody Reg initially suspected. There was some humour thrown in, the best being when Harry is shown to be gullible.. again.",8

However, what no one on Voyager realizes is that he is also something else....EVIL!!! It seems that this hologram was NOT sent by Starfleet but was stolen by the Ferengi and they're going to use it to steal something. But what? And how did they get this technology? And, more importantly, how can they warn Voyager once the folks on Earth discover the plot?!This is a very good episode and is worth seeing.

Back on Voyager Tuvok has entered his once-in-seven-year mating cycle which leads to emotional instability, Tom suggests he uses the holodeck to relieve his tensions but this attracts the hologram hating aliens. Luckily their ship is no match for Voyager and after the Doctor transmits the details of the ship the Flyer is on Voyager mounts a rescue.This was a fun episode, while there are plenty of good action scenes the real highlight of this episode is Jeri Ryan's portrayal of Seven of Nine during her possession by The Doctor, it was delightful to see a normally very restrained character revelling in her senses.",8

This way, they can save him. Despite not finding the holo man, these folks take Harry and Seven prisoner. But with the Doctor inside, often Seven behaves a lot like him--and Jeri Ryan did a great job impersonating his manner. It's a bit confusing when the Captain of this ship, a guy, falls for Seven. And, a bit later, the Doctor finds himself falling for one of these aliens. All in all, very confusing but funny--and a great chance to see that Ms. Ryan really can act.

""You Murdered him, you decompiled him"" and they get tossed into the Lokirrim Ship's Hoosegow.But the reports of The Doctor's Decompilation are a little Premature, he stuck himself into Seven! So for the next 39 minutes, Jeri Ryan makes us utterly BELIEVE that Robert Picardo is LIVING in her Borg Implanted SKIN.Meanwhile, back on Voyeur, Tuvok is undergoing a Tarelian Mumps attack that he had about ""seven"" years earlier. Tom Paris sets him on a diet of Hormones and promises discretion, but it is not that all of the rest of the crew including Janeway don't know what's really happening.""Seven"" is called on by Captain Ranek to explain the Delta Flyer, Replicators and Cheesecake. So they gorge themselves and drink massive amounts of booze to top it off, while The Doctor in control of Seven blathers on about how much she owes everything to the most important person in the universe - The Doctor.She/He gets the Mobile Emitter back but has to agree to act as a Ships Doctor- When The Doctor is finally put back into The Emitter, Seven is VERY angry- But she can hardly stand, due to the 8 glasses of Champagne The Doctor indulged in. If you think back a few episodes, and remember what happens when she drank just ONE glass (It was in the episode where they tried to use the Quantum-Slipstream Drive from ""Hope and Fear"" ""Timeless"").After The Doctor agrees to behave, Seven plans to acquire Captain Ranek's command codes. Seems like Ranek is a little Intrigued by Doctor Seven as well, he tried to cram his tongue down Seven's Throat. To make matters worse, the Doc is also a little intrigued by Jaryn (Gallagher), who almost causes an unlikely ""Hormonic Accident"" while giving him a massage!Back at Voyeur, Tom creates a Holodeck version of Tuvok's Wife (Marva Hicks) - And we get to see, almost, what really would have happened to Spock in ""Amok Time"" had his wife decided not to go all ""Kalifi"" on him- But as Tuvok starts into it, Voyager is attacked by another Lokaran ship, because they detected the Holodeck. Janeway has to agree not to use the Holodeck for a while, frustrating Tuvok.When Seven confronts The Doctor about his becoming aroused, he gives us GUILTY look number 47-A: The jutting-out of the lower jaw. What a spot! There simply is no way of coming out of this conundrum clean, Er, Or, with clean pants at least.The Award of the Decade goes to Jeri Ryan, she has every move, every vocal inflection, every bit of The Doctor's personality. But with a bit of Femininity added. But he/she is still his verbose and bragging and irritating self.So She/He uses the ammo She/He's GOT against Ranek, and knocks him out, sends a message to Voyeur, and they are just as Confuddled by this Genderbent Doctor. But they get the gist, kick their escort ships Arse, and haul Arse over to where Ranek's ship is. Ranek tries to retaliate, but the real Seven shuts down their Shields, and Ranek is hurt. It takes The Doctor saving his life to get the whole Lokaran ship to drop their personal shields as well.This episode was some indication of the Photonic Rebellion that is explored in ""Flash and Blood"" parts I and II- At this time, Janeway had no idea - That she caused this as well.And as always this whole Episode is Tom Paris' fault - Or at least Robert Duncan McNeill's who directed it. Ironically, Paris whips up a Photonic solution for Tuvok' 7-Year Itch, and this plays out in parallel with the Photonic Phoreplay of The Doctor.",10

However, the Hirogen decided to make their prey more interesting--tougher, meaner, smarter.

And, these holo characters have all left the facility and have headed into space!!

The Doctor bonds too quickly with the killer holos and starts to over-identify with them. As a result, he's become more of a liability than an asset.

We also get to see old enemies who have been absent for several seasons... I think the past adversaries were my favorite parts! My only complaint about this episode is we do not see Kess.There was a lengthy part in the middle dealing with ""Captain Proton"". It seemed like it was meant to be comical, but it wasn't very funny, IMHO. If you are anything like me, then when watching this part you had the same attitude as Cpt. Janeway (get me out of here... with her appropriate rolling of the eyes!).Not perfect (see previous paragraph), but it was a mostly enjoyable trek down nostalgia lane (which I mostly enjoyed). And even if you aren't a Voyager historian, I think it was interesting from the ""lame"" time-travel aspect of the story... because it wasn't anywhere near typical time-travel (can you say ""non-chronological""?).",8

Chakotay is zapped and ends up in sickbay--and from then on whenever he moves about the ship, each section is in a different part of time. Why? No one knows and it never makes sense nor is it the least bit interesting...well, except for the part where OLDER Janeway encounters Dr. Chaotica. That is kinda cute. Otherwise, a tedious episode that represents the worst sort of show the series could give us.HINT: IF the words TEMPORAL or ANOMALY appear in a show, it will undoubtedly suck.

I did not feel like going through another round of Telanna fights. However by the end of the episode I was impressed by how they both have seemed to have grown and show that they care for one another more openly. Not only that, but this episode was constructed in such a way in that really pulled you into the characters' plight.When someone becomes a parent, they are often reminded of what they went through as a child. This happened with B'Elanna, and we were given a little more insight into why she hated being Klingon so much. While she did get teased a little, it was her interpretation of her father's departure being not only her fault directly for telling him to leave, but indirectly her and her mother's fault for being Klingon and too difficult to live with, as she overheard him complain about them.This whole portrayal was very realistic, minus the Klingons! It is very common for adults to still harbor illogical beliefs that surface when things happen to them as children exactly like this.In the end, you really felt B'Elanna's pain when she finally confessed all of this to Tom. Tom did a stellar job in comforting her and putting her fears to rest. I was impressed by both of them in this scene so far as being mature characters in a relationship. Due to their acting in this sequence, it was highly believable and moving. Also, knowing these events made B'Elanna's actions in the past when she denied her heritage a little more understandable.The episode ended on a very feel-good note when B'Elanna finally accepted her child as part Klingon and gave the most realistic heartfelt smile I have seen her give in the series.The idea of genetic manipulation arose as well. This is a timeless issue, and it was interesting to hear the arguments. There were comparisons made about how is it okay to correct one defect, but not another? As genetic manipulation becomes more realistic in future years, we may be revisiting these issues.",

Here, a child is in the offing, and the responses are at best silly, from them and from the crew. B'Ellana's confrontation with her father and her guilt are at the center here.

But it wasn't written into the script then. They had her character wear a smock/jacket over her uniform.I truly liked this episode. Because I felt it dealt with real life issues such as childhood abandonment by a parent and being bullied as a child and how these things affect a person.

Identity issues are common in today's world and fictionally in the inter-species world of Star Trek. I think that some Trek fans forget that Gene Roddenberry's original vision was not just of a fictional, Scifi world, but a world that relates 24th century life to 20/21st century life.

""Lineage"" does this very thing...it starts out with good possibilities, but falls flat very soon.Its failure has nothing to do with the energy of the actors- all the regulars give it their best effort, in particular Robert Duncan McNeill & Roxann Dawson, who turn in perhaps their most emotionally charged performances of the entire series. Rather, the major faults here include poor writing and poor guest star casting.With respect to writing, the plot moves at a snail's pace, with little or no action, and very little humorous interplay to fill this void. And the plot holes make the Grand Canyon look like a drainage ditch. In a series franchise like Star Trek that has time and time again passionately preached the message that ALL life is sacred, special, and worthy just as it is, B'Elanna attempts to have her baby surgically altered by using unethical and illegal means (commondeering ship systems, locking out Voyager's security team, reprogramming the Doctor) and yet she is not punished or reprimanded in any way.And, speaking of which, what ABOUT that very sneaky trick of diabolically altering the Doctor's program to make him an unwitting accomplice to an ""ethnic cleansing"" of the unborn child? True, she does apologize to him, but in the ""respect everyone's individual rights at all times"" world of Star Trek, shouldn't the consequences of her dangerous actions be a little more severe than her mild embarrassment at having to apologize to him? Finally, poor guest star casting makes the situation worse. The actor cast as B'Elanna's father is just too wimpy too be believable..he's a good actor, but he is simply the wrong choice for the part. We're supposed to believe that this rather effeminate & ""milk-toasty"" guy won the admiration of...and married.. a KLINGON woman? He seems more suited to play the mild-mannered Dad on some Nickelodeon show or perhaps The Disney Channel, not the husband of a woman from an aggressive warrior race that values strength and power above all else.The story and end result here mirrors many of Voyager's Seventh Season installments- good concept, but poor execution.",3

This gets B'Elanna thinking, perhaps she could get the Doctor to perform further treatments so that her child will not have Klingon features and will thus avoid the bullying she suffered as a child. Her husband Tom and The Doctor are both horrified at the idea of performing such a procedure but B'Elanna takes drastic measures to persuade the Doctor to do it.The story wasn't too bad but it did feel like an ""issue of the week"" episode where it was clear that we were meant to think B'Elanna was making the wrong decision but doing so for good reasons. There was far less excitement than in most episodes, in fact apart there was never any feeling of threat.

It has so many inconsistencies based on childrearing in the 24th century that it is pretty much ridiculous. I will now reveal to you the source of the inconsistency which forces each ST series to falter by season 7: ""Writers of the Week"" fill the bulk of the 170+ episodes in all the Star Trek series' since TNG. These writers, sideline fans seeking pay, are terrible at keeping consistency to the storyline or the universe in general. Take this episode for example ( although it is not alone by a long shot ) ...it's complete garbage. The flashbacks of B'elanna's past are filmed with such painfully bad actors that they are basically unbelievable and nigh unwatchable. Notice how all the good Voyager Episodes are written by Brannon Braga? The good writers come up with the show and make usually the pilots and cliffhangers ( beginning and ends of each season with a mid-season cliffhanger as well) all the other episodes are written by these hack ""writers of the week."" In the Star Trek universe, all, ALL crewmen and officers are sterilized (thru injections administered by the doctor as part of their medical regimen (checkups)) unless express permission to procreate is given by the captain, which in this case would never happen. Do you think Voyager could run for several months without a chief engineer? Answer, NO. Thus she would never let this happen. Secondly, Genetic Modification of ANY sort is expressly ILLEGAL in the Star Trek universe as was laid out for us (long before this series/episode came out that's for sure) in DS9 with the antics of our beloved genetically superior Dr. Bashir. Thirdly, no officers shall fraternize with another member of the crew. Fraternization leads to conflict of interest. Could B'elanna order Tom Paris to his death if necessary? They prevent fraternization for this very reason. An emotional wife is not going to send her husband to his death even if it costs the crew of 145 their lives. So besides being a complete waste of film, this episode was terribly written and inconsistency is the rule of the day. It's episodes like this that ruin the whole, they aren't just filler, they are rotten apples ruining the rest of the bunch. Please, if you ever make another ST series, and I believe you will with the coming tsunami that is the new Star Trek movie ( 2009 ), write the entire thing before the first episode is shot a la Babylon 5. Take a lesson from the pros. Get a real set of writers and stick with them. Sign contracts. Make them study and watch each episode of Star Trek from front to back and hell, create a rules handbook for writing ST episodes so that they don't make stupid mistakes. More importantly though, no one would agree to travel for 3 generations in a starship just to get home. They would land on the best class-M planet they could find and live there, creating a colony and hoping one day the Federation would come along. First and foremost, these ships are run by people. People with their own agendas, not just Starfleets. Are we to believe that these people just work every day for the rest of their lives? Even excessive amounts of shore leave and all the holodeck time in the world couldn't make these officers stay aboard. From the beginning Voyager was a bad concept. Don't get me wrong, it turned out OK... I LOVE the Doctor, but still...things like this should never go forward again. If I was the executive funding this giant I sure wouldn't put my life in the hands of ""writers of the week"" or certainly not this weak concept for a ST series.Rest assured, if the Star Trek Universe were real this episode would never of happened. Knowing that the STU is NOT real, this episode still should never have happened. Wonderfully convenient way to cover up Roxanne Dawson's pregnancy, though. Couldn't she wait one more year to procreate? Contracts people. Contracts. These episodes were filmed at a cost in excess of a million dollars an episode. Over the 170 episode series it cost them in excess of 170 million dollars to film Voyager. Don't let a rogue actress get in the way of all that money I say... This is business. They certainly built the Juggernaut that should have been Voyager on a foundation of sand.",3

A Human/Klingon hybrid would take massive amounts of genetic engineering to achieve The doctor makes ridiculous faith-based statements that Klingon components within B'Ellana's baby are natural. You can almost hear him say that ""God designed the baby this way, who are we to tamper with providence and nice naturalness"". The writer momentarily touches on his hypocrisy in wanting to modify the baby's spine. Unfortunately, one of the bugbears of the Star Trek world is the ridiculous stagnation of humanity and their strange ability to talk to aliens, even when their translator has been taken off them.

Although force fields are certainly more ""high tech"" (and allow a better view of the guest star prisoners for the television audience), from a practical standpoint they make no sense at all. Force fields require constant power, maintenance, and are always at risk of disappearing during a power failure (which is exactly what happens here, allowing the prisoners to escape and wreak havoc).Even in the advanced 24th century, wouldn't just plain old fashioned steel bars be much better for confining prisoners? They are relatively cheap, easy to install, require no maintenance or power source, and won't disappear during a power failure. Just a thought.......",9

One of the prisoners, Iko, manages to take Seven hostage in sick bay but he is soon recaptured and sent to the makeshift holding cells that have been constructed in one of the cargo bays. When serving the food another prisoner tells Neelix how their system of justice is highly biased; his minority race making up the majority of the prison population and even when the majority race is convicted they get lesser sentences. After Iko is badly beaten by the guards Janeway insists that only Star Fleet security will act as guards. Iko is taken back to sick bay where the Doctor treats him with Seven's nanoprobes, after this treatment his personality is radically changed and for the first time he feels guilt for the crimes he has committed. Later on when a Voyager is attacked and the prisoners escape it is Iko who saves his captor.I felt this episode was trying to say something about the US penal system with one minority being over represented in the prisons but later on it is shown that most of the prisoners were guilty as charged and willing to manipulate the sympathetic for their own ends. Perhaps showing two conflicting arguments and lettering the viewer decide is the best way to air an issue.",8

The result of that stroke is a total loss of memory and a personality change. When he realizes that he is going to be executed, he has no mental connection to his crime. Should we now execute the body when the mind is completely overhauled? It's an incredibly hard one to answer. I guess what we fall back on is the chances of such an event occurring are infinitesimal.

In order to further fulfil the prophecy they destroy their ship forcing Janeway to beam all two hundred of them to Voyager. Once over many of them believe that B'Elanna can't be the mother of the one spoken of in the prophecy as she is only half Klingon, the fact that the baby's father is human makes things even worse.

Feeling that the prophecy can't have been fulfilled a group of the Klingon's attempt to take Voyager.This was a fairly good episode of Voyager which contains both action and some comedy. It was funny to see Harry attempting to get away from Klingon woman with romantic intentions and Neelix helping Harry by getting the woman for himself. There have been plenty of episodes where B'Elanna has been forced to deal with her Klingon heritage, thankfully it wasn't overplayed here despite her being seen as the mother of their saviour.

Brown) beams over.These Refuges from Qo'NoS have been traveling for generations looking for ""The Kuvamagh"" - Some kind of Klingon Messiah, so they pick B'Elanna's unborn child to be this god!Suddenly, 200 Klingons are all over Voyager cos they blew up their ship. This Kohlar is the epitome of an Evangelical, Charismatic Preacher, even talks like one. Kind of sounds like The Sisko in that regard.Actually I liked it, a full Klingon that spoke like Martin Luther King. But Kohlar's side-kick ""T'Greth"" (Sherman Howard) has a smaller Faith than Kohlar's - At least in Appearance.Because as Kohlar orally and Visibly seems to expound a full Faith in his Klingon Religion, he actually just wants an End to the Wandering.It was convenient they came across the One Ship in the Delta Quadrant with at least one partially Klingon Crewoman who had been knocked up during the one month that the Kuvamagh was supposed to be conceived.So it seems that with Kohlar, in Losing his Faith, he found it. But this must needs be tested. T'Greth challenges Paris to a duel to the death, which Janeway immediately intervenes in to make it potentially less bloody.But these Klingons are all infected with ""The Tourette Syndrome"" and it infects B'Elanna and her Baby. T'Greth see this as yet another shortcoming with their new ""'IHrIStoS ngan voDleH"" and moves to take over Voyager. Fast thinking by Tuvok and Janeway prevent this, giving the Doctor the time he needs to find a cure for Tourette Syndrome.And it is all in B'Elanna's Child's Split Heritage Stem Cells. So they have found their Saviour after all.There is a little Side-Comedy when a large and beautiful Klingon Woman ""Ch'Rega"" (Peggy Jo Jacobs) gets infatuated with Harry - Aw, C'Mon Harry, this would have made up for ""Seven"" Years of falling for the Wrong Borg! But he's too Chicken, whereas Neelix is not!I'll say this about Neelix, that man can ADAPT. It seems he is another like Dax from Deep Space Nine, who although not a Klingon understands what a Klingon is and loves it. This is probably his finest moment on Voyager.Faith and Comedy, kind of an unusual mixture of concepts, but not too far fetched, because it is Faith that makes us believe in Trek just as much as it is Faith that drives our belief in The Prophets.Ironically, although this is a Fiction, this is precisely how Faith is. Faith is not the Blind following of one's Religion, it's when a person believes in where that Religion will take them, and sometimes we do things in frustration with that Faith that are the exact Steps we should take - In this story, Kohlar's frustration and seeking to end his ship's wandering - Or rather, his giving up - Was the very thing that brought him to his personal Goal. That is how Faith Works. It is not by blindly following a book of Rules, but by knowing in your Heart what is right, and sometimes that means going against what is written in the Rulebook.",10
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Prophecy (TV Episode 2001)",Not bad..but certainly a wasted opportunity...,"A fairly entertaining Season 7 installment- with a particularly funny subplot involving Neelix & an amorous Kilingon woman- but the rest is rather mediocre.The appearance of Klingons in ANY Star Trek show always brings the promise of high drama, action, and adventure...unfortunately here, the promise isn't kept. This particular episode features the Klingons spending much more time in staff meetings than in battle or in conflict.The plot moves along quite slowly. A great opportunity to explore a very old Klingon battle cruiser from Captain Kirk's(!) era is squandered early, and the main ""action"" of the piece..a battle showdown between Tom Paris and an aggressive Klingon challenger...is devoid of any real drama because all the actors- including Robert Duncan McNeill- are so nonchalant about it that no dramatic tension has a chance to build, and so we never really feel that Tom is ever in any danger or at risk at any time (which one would ordinarily expect when one is forced to fight an angry Klingon).The ""poor casting"" gremlin that seems to haunt Voyager's last two seasons strikes again here with the casting of Wren T. Brown as the Klingon leader Kohlar. Although a competent actor who turns in a sincere performance, Mr. Brown lacks the Klingon ""edginess""- (the simmering and chilling threat of barely restrained aggression that could burst forth at any moment)- that the best Klingon actors in Star Trek possess (Michael Dorn, Robert O'Reilly, Christoper Lloyd, Christoper Plummer, etc.) Mr. Brown's portrayal is quiet, subdued, polite, and soft spoken- not threatening at all, and certainly not Klingon. It should be noted that two of Mr. Brown's previous roles include a turn as Whoopi Goldberg's comic relief brother in Whoopi"" (2003-2004) and as a reoccurring character in ""The New Adventures of Flipper"" (1995). Hmmmm...I rest my case on the casting issue.Not the worst Voyager adventure by any means, but don't expect to be on the edge of your seat during this one..rather, you're more likely to be comfortably settled in it and possibly dozing off from time to time.",5

In a later episode ('Endgame'? - I'll find it soon...) the Bat'Leth on the wall is now a traditional Bat'Leth, not in the 'Kayless' style. Shame. Shame. Shame. Shame. Shame..... I love this episode. Its interesting to see B'Ellana's embarrassment at having all these 'musky' Klingons around. The part about the musk is funny. I like how Voyager puts them in their place, by using the sensors to see through the cloak and disabling them easily.

However, in this episode she delivers a brilliant performance. She demonstrates toughness in a very natural manner by showing confidence and leadership and having the big picture and imposing this view on a crew who are clearly overwhelmed by their seemingly hopeless circumstance. This was by far her best performance, she faces down Tuvok, Chakotay, and 7/9 who wanted to adopt a more barbaric strategy of survival by telling them at key moments, 'does it really matter if we last 7 days instead of 2?' Janeway didn't just spout federation rules, instead she dug deeper into the concepts to see why they work and how they can be applied even here.

Voyager's Supplies get swiped within seconds, and then the ship that had swiped the goodies gets vaporized by a ship of a guy named ""Valen"" (Babylon 5's Robin Sachs), who now has all of Voyager's Deuterium and some of their food.There is also a new Race, designed from Doctor Seuss characters, the main one played by Jonathan Del Arco who was ""Hugh Borg"" in Next Generation, his character in this is ""Fantome"" - Named by The Doctor for ""Phantom of The Opera""- They appear to be natural citizens of this part of non-space, they can hide themselves, and they can speak by chirping on Padds after The Doc shows them how.Where one ship cannot even come close to escaping this crappy area, several ships in tandem could, but this is a lawless area where personal morals need not seem to apply.Nevertheless, Janeway enforces Starfleet Principles and forms a small Alliance with some other stranded ships.But one of these ""allies' is a Beak-Faced Jerk named ""Bosaal"" (Michael Shamus Wiles who was a similar creep and cretin in The X-Files), who will not adhere to the standards that Janeway has set for behavior, he keeps attacking other ships so Janeway kicks his Beakfaced Buttocks out of the alliance, leaving them with only 4 ships total.The Googys, who are natural born Peeping Toms and Spies, spy on Bosaal and find out he is gonna attack with Valen, So Janeway elicits Help from the Dr Seuss Aliens to make it all backfire on Bosaal.There is also another pair of ships Captained by the Venture Star Chief from ""Avatar"", Scott Lawrence (""Garon""- He was also in ""Into Darkness"") and he becomes a stolid Janeway supporter - Because he likes Voyager's food more.So it just goes to show that a little Federation Morality will go a long way in getting out of jams. Janeway is kind to a group of Aliens who is kicked around by the other captains, and by saying true to who she is, this little act of kindness goes a long away in saving the butts of Four stranded Ships-And it is all because Seven of Sixty-Nine gives Jon Del Arco her food, shaming Janeway into doing even more for the critters.Ain't it interesting that Valen's ship looks like a Maquis Raider and ""The Nightingale"" that Harry Captained?",10

In order to try to escape the void Janeway tries to persuade the various other ships to form an alliance so that each can bring their own strengths to the effort.This was a decent episode which saw crew members question their captain's insistence on sticking to Star Fleet protocols even if that means they might not survive; of course ultimately the survive because they stick to their guiding principles.

The only solution is to steal supplies from other ships drawn into the Void.This, of course, goes against the principles of the Federation, but as we've established from watching seven years of this show, Janeway is a a fanatic who will stick to the Prime Directives even at the cost of her life and everyone else on board Voyager. She even directly states in this episode that she'd rather see the entire crew die rather than resort to becoming ""thieves and murderers""... in a situation where they would only need to become ""thieves""... by taking their supplies back from another thief, along with taking back what was stolen from other vessels.So Janeway is fanatical enough, cold-hearted enough, masochistic enough, and misanthrophic enough to deny her crew the bare necessities of survival if it means bending the rules JUST A LITTLE. She honestly doesn't care if her crew starves to death, so long as they don't steal food from a thief! Remember this, Star Trek viewers: One of the principles of the Prime Directive is for a ship's captain to do everything possible to save their crew, and here's Janeway willing to see them ALL die just to let a THIEF keep his STOLEN GOODS stolen from someone he more than likely KILLED ANYWAY.No matter your moral views on this, you HAVE to acknowledge that when you're lost in the wilderness and food is running out, you can't just risk your crew starving to death just because you'd FEEL BAD ABOUT STEALING FROM A THIEF! This is why Janeway is the absolute worst of all the captains of this era.Picard is someone who follows the Prime Directives, but recognizes that there are situations where it cannot be upheld without causing a severe moral, or even actual dilemma. He breaks the Prime Directives in order to save lives.Sisko is someone who follows the Prime Directives, and also recognizes that situations are not always so clear cut, black and white, and he's willing to break the Prime Directives for a greater good, typically because of his regard for sentient life.Janeway, by comparison, follows the Prime Directives, frequently at the cost of sentient life.So rather than deal with others, she outright REFUSES to deal with ANYONE who in ANYWAY goes against her authoritarian ideals. She forms an alliance with WILLING aliens caught in the Void, then IMPOSES her Federation ideals upon the Alliance. Certain things like not killing or stealing are obvious and easy enough, but it gets to a point where she KICKS OUT an ENTIRE ship because it's captain got components for their warp engine because they traded stolen equipment from a ship they destroyed earlier.And ever the tactless moron, she does this with intense hatred and rancor in her voice and tone and expression that it causes the other alien to GO AND HELP JANEWAY'S ENEMY! AND THE ONLY WAY THEY FIGURE THIS OUT IS BY LISTENING TO A RECORDED CONVERSATION MADE BY ANOTHER ALIEN WHO'S SPYING ON EVERYONE ON THE SHIP---ANOTHER VIOLATION OF THE ALLIANCE'S IDEALS! Ultimately the solution is solved by technobabble, a lazy hackneyed plot device, the new Deus Ex Machina for a terrible set of writers.",1

Previous to Voyager's appearance, the law of the land was raid any new ship that appears, and fight it out yourself.Janeway, using Starfleet principles, instead decides to create a mini star fleet, by convincing other ships to band together, share resources, in order to escape their situation.It shows how the more aggressive species hurt this concept with their behavior, and why the joining of forces works well.On top of that, it is a pretty exciting episode, with many good scenes, and satisfying from start to finish.

However, this isn't embraced by everyone. Some species are just jerks! And some of the jerks either want to betray their new 'friends', hold back on supplies they are about to share or take pleasure in killing off some native humanoids (frankly, I could understand as these dirty looking musical creatures did seem pretty annoying).Aside from the Doctor continually mispronouncing 'Fantome' (it was supposed to be French but his pronunciation was WAY off) and the annoying native creatures, this was a decent episode.

This came out as a joke and story he told about a hostile encounter with a man who tried to insult his father.

No, she and most other crew members had been captured by aliens and had their memories altered to believe that was where they belonged. The only members of the crew not taken were Chakotay, Harry and Neelix who were on an away mission at the time and The Doctor who is now the ""Emergency Command Hologram"".

They manage to beam B'Elanna back to the ship but as the episode ends Chacotay finds himself cornered by local security while Voyager must move away as it comes under attack.This opening episode of a two part story was pretty good, establishing the characters in their new lives and setting up potential villains or allies. It was nice to see the Doctor get a chance to use his ECH subroutines and his bickering with Harry about who was in command while Chakotay was on the surface was amusing.

Then, ships came to scavenge Voyager but the Doctor (acting as Captain) was able to evade them until the three crewmen returned. Here's the weird part.

In order to figure out what is going on and escape the planet the crew must both trust each other and local personnel.This episode provided a good conclusion to the story. I liked how the crew on the surface only gradually came to accept that they had been kidnapped, even then many other them were relying on the circumstantial evidence that they had all been employed on the same day and had had medical treatment.

Then, the crew have forgotten most of their past and are now happy workers at some giant industrial complex. In the meantime, Chakotay, Kim and Neelix were in the shuttle and missed all this. Now upon returning to Voyager, they learn what's occurred and are determined to get the crew back and de-program them. When the episode ends, an away mission to rescue B'Elanna ends with all sorts of crap going wrong.This episode has more of the same--more attempts by the crew to contact ex-crew members and bring them back to the ship. Additionally, I really liked that so many on the planet did NOT know that their new workers had been brainwashed and others did. This conspiracy aspect was pretty cool.

His pomposity is the side he manages to exude to the Crew, but when it comes down to One-On-One, he has always kept Doctor- Patient Confidentiality in Highest Regard, even if it is not a Medical ""Secret"".So when Seven-of-Nine (And I will not add 'Sixty' this time) goes off on her own and starts her personal study of Intimacy with her fantasy Chakotay, The Doc keeps her secret.When this episode starts out, we actually are fooled into thinking that Seven really had her Huge Borg Implants removed, and is donning a Starfleet Uniform (Which she looks great in) and is interacting with The Crew, becoming more Hooman than we have ever seen, even to the point of getting Crew Quarters and installing a Baby Grand Piano.Unfortunately, it's a house of cards, just like her paranoid delusions in ""The Voyager Conspiracy"", but it is a house of cards that is the result of her Cortical Array breaking down, just like when she downloaded too much Data into her Brain.And Janeway as well as The Doctor actually encourage her do go on these explorations, but it is just that her timing is off by a few nanoseconds, when she should be trying to figure out a dangerous Anomaly she is playing Chopin Chopsticks with Chakotay while eating Roast Chicken and teaching him the proper way to slice Carrots.Meanwhile, huge explosions are randomly showing up all around Voyager, they have accidentally strayed in to a Live Fire Testing ground for Alien Smart Bombs.And in the midst of this, Seven breaks Down. The Doc sees exactly what she is up to, and not one word of this leaks out of his Program.It seems that The Borg have built in a self destruct for any Drone that becomes too much of an Individual, it's part of her main Cortical Node.So we have to have a tacit Pause at the Coda, to be continued at some time before the Series ends. Her Holo-Chakotay was simply an experimental choice, but we see that Chakotay might really have a true interest and attraction to her. I've always agreed with this, even more than Tom and B'Elanna.

In a hint at things to come, Seven gets it on with a holo Chakotay (a shade of things to come in the series). However, in getting further and further immersed in this holo world, Seven slowly comes to realize that she's neglecting her duties. By the end, she's determined to be the same old boring Seven that she was before....This is a decent and entertaining show because you get to see Jeri Ryan greatly expand her acting skills in the show.

Unfortunately she is spending so much time there that it is impacting on her work. This is rather serious when Voyager finds itself in an alien weapon testing area with its warp drive off line. Seven is meant to be working on finding a way to locate incoming weapons before they can do further damage but instead she is spending more time having a relationship with a holographic version of Commander Chakotay. Ultimately her holodeck activities are stopped, not by the Captain but by her own Borg implants which unbeknownst to her were programmed to shut her down if she got emotionally stimulated.I think Seven of Nine is a great character but this was not her best episode, her Borg obsession with efficiency is one of the things that make her an interesting character so seeing her act like everybody else wasn't all that exciting...

A confrontation with an alien species leaves Icheb critically injured; to save Icheb he must accept responsibility for his actions even if that means suffering an undisclosed punishment.After a less than promising start this episode picked up nicely and proved my initial fears were unwarranted. Keegan de Lancie did a reasonable job as Q Jnr, and John de Lancie, his real life father, was fine as Q Snr. It was good that Jnr lost his powers so we didn't just have an episode full of Voyager being used as his toy. As the episode concluded both Qs had learnt a lesson which was well handled.

When Voyager's crew see what happens on The Doctor's fictional USS Vortex they are not impressed, all of the characters are clearly based on them with a few minor changes to names and appearance but their behaviour is very different, the captain's alter ego kills a wounded crewman because The Doctor wants to treat him ahead of a less seriously injured crewman and with the exception of Seven's character all the people on the Vortex treat their Doctor with contempt, thinking of him as a mere tool. The Doctor believes that nobody will think that his book is based on Voyager and the crew are being over-sensitive. When Tom tweaks the novel the Doctor is given a taste of his on medicine when he finds himself on the USS Voyeur where the EMH drugs patients to take advantage of them. He agrees to rewrite his work but his publisher releases the work anyway claiming that as a Hologram the Doctor has no rights so can't protect his work. This leads to a tribunal to determine just what his status is.I rather enjoyed this episode, finding USS Vortex to be an amusing parody of life on Voyager and I loved Tom's revenge with USS Voyeur.

""Author, Author"" is a great episode! What needs to be said, is said. And the resultant decision and consequences at the end of the episode are believable and well written. Just so you know, this is a funny and very touching episode, in equal measure. Seven gets to make more of a connection to reclaiming her humanity, too. So, it's not all about the Doctor.There are certain parallels occurring even now, in 2016, with regard to acceptance of certain sexual and gender orientations - which this episode strikes a chord with, if you ask me. Not that it covers these topics, per say, but its points can easily be carried through and onto such subjects, and highlight them (for anybody with an empathic enough, and wise enough heart/mind).When I saw this episode, it again served as a reminder and question of ""Just how many times does the Human Race need to make the EXACT SAME MISTAKES over something/somebody which/who is ""different"" or against ""the norm"" - how many times does it need to go on the ""Witch Hunt"" - before it finally grows a gosh darn BRAIN, and learns its lesson!?"". I highly recommend that you watch and enjoy this episode of Voyager (I am sure the latter is an inevitability). And hope that you give that question above some major thought.

For me, the funny episodes they periodically tossed in were among some of the very best--they provided some welcome relief from the otherwise VERY serious nature of the show.When the show begins, they've established a Skype-like system where crew members can make live calls to the Alpha Quadrant. Surprisingly, one of the most excited about this is the Doctor! Despite being a hologram, he has ideas about becoming a great author and his ego is stroked when a big publishing house wants his novel. Folks are shocked, however, when they see that this novel sure makes it look as if the Doctor is a great, great man and the crew, which is WAY too much like Voyager's, is full of evil jerks who couldn't get along without the Doc. It's VERY funny to say the least. But what is funnier is Tom Paris' re-write. In it, the Doctor is a jerk AND he sports a ridiculous comb-over! Overall, this episode is very slight but it's also very funny. If you don't mind a tongue-in-cheek episode, it's one of the better episodes of the final season. Well worth seeing--and it's a great chance to see just how far the Doctor's ego has gone!By the way, two of the guest stars in this ones are Barry Gordon (the blue publisher) and the arbitrator (Joseph Campanella).

And if anyone here has seen TNG's ""measure of a man"", where Picard defends Data's status/rights as a sentient being, they will recognize the court scenes as a direct rip-off; one that in my opinion was very poorly done.I like seeing the fate of the other EMH doctors brought up again. I had actually been hoping for it to happen, but not like this. I could not believe that the doctor had chosen this method for getting that point across. Living witness showed an evil version of the crew and I love that episode. But that was the history that Quarren had been taught. But I don't think that display was this despicable and it is despicable to have a crew member write it. The court scenes I mentioned are something you will have to form your own opinion on.

When they locate it on an apparently uninhabited planet an away team is dispatched to retrieve it. They find the planet is a radioactive wasteland but isn't as uninhabited as they thought; taken prisoner they are told that Earth is to blame for the suffering as the conditions result from the locals' attempts to use the technology used in the probe. The leader of the local populations tells Janeway that if she wants to get her people back she must find a new planet for them all to live on and transport them there. When asked to give a crew member back as a sign of good faith one is returned... dead having been executed just before transporting. While three of the away team are captured Chakotay and Harry capture a prisoner of their own and one Voyager he is treated for his radiation sickness and discusses an alternate solution to the problem.This was a good episode which showed how something done with the best of motives can have terrible unforeseen consequences. It also mirrored classic episodes from the original series where a group of regular characters would be joined on an away mission my a character we'd never seen before who's job was to die to show just what sort of danger they were up against, it is just a shame he wasn't wearing a red shirt!",8
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Friendship One (TV Episode 2001)",Responsible people are guilty for reckless people's terrible choices,"I have watched nearly all Star Trek Voyager episodes (indeed, nearly all Star Trek anything episodes and movies), and while I generally find them entertaining whether I agree with the writers' premise or not, this one is hopelessly irredeemable.300 years before present Star Trek time, Earth had sent out a probe, ""Friendship One,"" with much technical and scientific information (along with some artistic/musical samples). The probe made it to the Delta quadrant and was received/captured by a people who then proceeded to misuse the technology, ending up with the equivalent of a nuclear wasteland.Voyager, having established a real-time comm link with Star Fleet, is assigned to go looking for the probe, and they find the planet. The survivors are led by a bitter coot who blames humans for intentionally sending a device designed to destroy their civilization. Right, my blame man. The leader arbitrarily rejects attempts by the away team to help them and further they murder one of the unarmed crewmen right before sending him back to Voyager. And the ""big-hearted' Voyager crew convinces Captain Janeway that they are responsible for the problems these virtue-less but self-righteous dummies on the planet are facing.The creators of this episode were so busy preaching they sank into moronic myopia. One group of people can be recklessly irresponsible but they are totally innocent and another group of people must be responsible for themselves AND the first group? This is how we know that actors and the people that surround them must generally be drop-outs -- they have no capacity for critical thinking. This acidic tone of judgment against decency makes it impossible to just enjoy the story.Suppose I spend all my time watching these stupid episodes and lose my job? Are the show's writers then bad people responsible for my loss?Really, Voyager-Land, some amount of kookiness I can deal with but this is way over the top.

3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Friendship One (TV Episode 2001)",Cool make-up.,"Now that the Federation can have regular contact with Voyager, they ask that they look for the Friendship 1 probe that was sent to the Delta Quadrant a long, long time ago. However, when the shuttle team land, they find that the place IS inhabited (despite the sensors) and these people are really angry. They blame the Earth for their plight, as they used the technology that powered Friendship 1 (antimatter) and destroyed themselves. Sure, a few folks remain, but they look nasty and are suffering from the aftereffects of the antimatter explosion. Not surprisingly, these folks are very hostile and soon take some of the away team prisoner. Now they try to use the team as a bartering tool and things get even nastier very quickly.This episode features some very nice make-up effects. The sore- covered aliens look really realistic and nasty. While the baby didn't look great--the rest of them sure did. In addition, the story is pretty exciting and worth seeing.By the way, this story seems a lot like an episode from ""Space: 1999"" concerning a probe powered by a 'Queller Drive'. This system ended up killing things because of its toxic emissions--and soon folks effected by it come looking for retribution!",8

Voyager and her crew are victimized by a man who speaks for a culture that nearly destroyed itself by trying to adapt technology from an Earth probe. When people do outrageous things and don't look at the consequences, the first they to do is to blame someone else. After 300 years, how could Voyager have anything to do with this destruction. The probe could just as easily have brought prosperity these people. They made their own beds. And to make matter worse, this megalomaniac decides it's his right to deprive everyone else based on his own hatred. He talks about how nothing they do will bring back all the dead. That is such a ludicrous statement, designed for him to keep his hatred and venom intact.",6

While they attempt to avoid breaking the prime directive they find the Ventu are more helpful than they expected; helping them find the remains of the shuttle so they can lower the energy shield to beam out. In orbit Voyager also tries to find away through the barrier which they have been told was erected by aliens to protect the primitives from more advanced people, the Ledos, elsewhere on the planet who wanted to exploit the them. When Seven finally gets the shield down it is clear that the Ledos haven't given up their hopes of exploiting the Ventu and are willing to use force to prevent Voyager re-establishing the shield. In a light-hearted sub-plot Tom breaks local piloting regulations and is forced to take a pilot training course with an officious local.The main story was pretty good, I liked the Ventu who communicated through a sign language which Chakotay tried to learn the basics of. The idea of having an advanced civilisation exploiting a primitive one was admittedly rather cliché but worked well enough. The secondary plot provided a few laughs especially when he abandons his class to remove the Ledos from Ventu territory while under fire.",7
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Natural Law (TV Episode 2001)",Chakotay and Seven really do great justice to the Prime Directive.,"The Prime Directive is often mentioned on the Trek shows. Its concept is that the Federation should NOT interfere with native species and allow them to grow naturally. Here they play lipservice to it at times.Chakotay does some lousy piloting of the shuttle and gets way too close to an area they were told not to approach! The invisible shield above smashes their craft and he and Seven crash through the barrier and land below. There they encounter a very primitive tribe of nice tribal folks and almost immediately Chakotay starts interacting with them. I guess that the Prime Directive was recently repealed. Seven, however, thinks that the Prime Directive DOES still apply and disagrees with Chakotay. She then shows her devotion to the Prime Directive by losing her tricorder--something which she never recovers and they eventually leave behind. Later, with the help of the natives, they find a way to contact Voyager. Unfortunately, now the Ledosians plan to improve the lives of these tribesmen---and it's all made possible by the break in the invisible dome caused by the shuttle.There's another minor plot in which the always impulsive and child- like Paris gets in trouble with some locals due to his hotdogging while piloting his shuttle. They insist that he take a class on how to fly! The Captain agrees and even though he thinks it's beneath him, he takes the class--always looking for a way to skip out this. After all, he IS a man-child and being responsible just ain't how he rolls. Fortunately, his instructor is NOT wowed by Paris' lies and attempts to get out of the class or end it prematurely. In the end, after massive exposure of the Federation to the tribespeople, the Captain then decides to close this dome forever. This is sort of like deciding your daughter will remain a virgin after she's already had her baby! All in all, a confusing and morally ambiguous episode that just seemed inconsistent and odd to say the least.",5
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Natural Law (TV Episode 2001)",Missed an opportunity,"I loved Voyager, but some of the episodes were hit or miss. For me, this episode was a miss because you had Seven and Chakotay stranded on a planet, but nothing was done to develop the relationship that was dumped on us in Endgame just two episodes later.We already know Seven has a bit of a crush on Chakotay from the Human Error episode earlier in the season. Rather than allowing a relationship to build naturally over several episodes, it's sprung on us as an afterthought.The episode itself was kind of meh, although I did enjoy the performance of a young Autumn Reeser as one of the natives.I'll skip all the Prime Directive dialogue that's been discussed in other reviews, but yeah- there's that too.",6
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Natural Law (TV Episode 2001)",(in The Simpsons' Comic Book Guy voice) Worst Episode Ever?,"OK, I am intentionally exaggerating in the title of my summary. But this really is quite bad. For starters, the A plot takes a coma-inducing twenty-five minutes to start moving and in the end, the final five minutes (before the epilogue featuring Seven of Nine and Chakotay) have been stuffed so full that the flash by in such a hurry that it's not worth the long set-up. And, of course, this is yet one boring Prime Directive episode. Then there's the B plot, a ""comedic"" story of Tom Paris having to attend flight school. It's so not funny that it makes me want to cry. Of course, it *conveniently* merges with the A plot in the end. So conveniently that it constitutes as lazy writing. The only saving grace of this episode is, of course, Jeri Ryan as Seven and an all too brief appearance of semi-legendary rent-a-dislike-able-elder-guy Ivar Brogger who's been in pretty much every TV show that amounts to something. Some interest may be also found in the fact that this is credited as Autumn Reeser's (the lovely Taylor in The O.C.) first acting work, but she's practically unrecognizable, a ten-year-old in alien make-up. So, in the end, a boring episode with only curiosity value.",4
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Natural Law (TV Episode 2001)","Janeway the Anti-Scientist, Liar, Cheater","Leaving aside the stale mediocrity of the episode, I'll get right to the stupid.The episode involves a planet in which there is a primitive tribal culture literally locked under a forcefield shield that was established by another alien species hundreds of years ago that has disappeared. These people are directly related to the highly advanced species that is currently interacting with Voyager.Naturally, Tattoo-boy and Seven of Nine get stuck in this when their shuttle crashes into it, all because Idiot-face wanted to look at the planet from the shuttle. They accidentally get involved with these tribal people, which Chakotay at first tried to avoid, due to the Prime Directives.However, his Prime Directive dribble goes right the hell out the door once they do find him, and he has the GALL to chastise Seven of Nine for NOT attempting to connect and communicate with the people, and FURTHER interfere with their lives.So towards the end, they manage to break open the forcefield using technobabble, and the civilization immediately comes down to explore and research the tribal peoples, a unique opportunity comparable to modern-day people not just of our own technology, but our ideals and policies of non-interference with a tribal culture.BUT JAAAAAANEWAAAAAAAAY HAS TO GET HER TYRANNIC SELF INVOLVED!!!~! Because this is the show that brought you ""Tattoo"", an episode so filled with spiritual love and respect for Native Americans, they established in canon-Trek that they were primitive, culture-less savages until they were touched by White Men from space, and who brought you Chakotay, a walking stereotype of Native American cliché's that often interfere with its own continuity (A man who fights the Cardassians in defense of his home also espouts that ""home is wherever you happen to be""), NATURALLY THIS IS A BAD AND TERRIBLE THING! Let's get this clear; these civilized people are not the ""Manifest Destiny""-era Americans, or Colonial Europeans. They do not plan to subjugate or exterminate these people, or study them while moving them to controlled environments and uprooting their culture. These are people who have been given a unique opportunity to witness FIRST-HAND the genesis of their own civilization, LITERALLY untouched by anyone.BUT JAAAAAAAAAAAANEWAAAAAAAY SAYS NNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! Because this goes against the New Age pseudo-hippie spiritualism, Janeway absolutely REFUSES this scientific opportunity, DESPITE BEING A FORMER SCIENCE OFFICER HERSELF, and decides to MANIPULATE THE PRIME DIRECTIVES TO SERVE HER OWN PURPOSES, by claiming that the technology used to open the forcefield is HERS, so she's gonna take it back because of Starfleet policy of non-interference with their planet...DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY ALREADY INTERFERED BY OPENING IT IN THE FIRST PLACE, MUCH LESS CHAKOTAY AND SEVEN OF NINE MAKING CONTACT AND COMMUNICATING.So what she allows by an accident born of pure stupidity in order to save the lives of one dimwit and one former Borg, she disallows in the name of cultural and scientific enlightenment of an ENTIRE CIVILIZATION! Naturally, since they go against JANEWAY'S point of view, these civilized people take all of 2.2 minutes to START FIRING ON VOYAGER! So Janeway escapes, denying an entire civilization the chance to study and better understand and appreciate their own past, for pretty much no coherent or logical reason other than fear.Yes, fear. Fear that these civilized people might destroy the culture of these tribal peoples. This fear would be well-founded if these civilized people showed anything BUT reverence, awe, and respect for these people already. Even then, it doesn't say much about the benevolence of Earth that they utterly shut down a huge opportunity for learning out of fear.",1

I thought it was very well written, acted, directed, and Ethan's performance was typically top notch! There was some good humor, suspense, excitement, and yes, a very touching send off for the character Neelix.Naomi Wildman also adds to this one, as well as Tuvok, who is particularly caring when it comes to the character Neelix and the tough choices he has to make.One reviewer complained ""(this episode states) you're only happy with your own race."" What an idiotic thing to say. He found a family with his same SPECIES which is a helluva lot deeper than just ""race"". Neelix really got to shine in this episode, and again, I found it a touching goodbye.",9
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Homestead (TV Episode 2001)",Farewell to Neelix,"While Neelix is leading the celebration of 'First Contact' day, a holiday of his own invention, the crew discovers a group of Telaxians living in a nearby asteroid field. When the Delta Flyer enters the field it is damaged my mining charges and makes a forced landing on the Telaxian's asteroid. After the landing Neelix is disappointed to find that the people there are suspicious of any non-Telaxians. As he gets to know them he grows to understand their suspicions as a group of alien miners are demanding they leave the asteroid so they can mine the minerals there. Voyager tries to help negotiations between the Telaxians and the miners but the latter are determined to mine the asteroid. It looks as if all is lost but Tuvok points out to Neelix that what the Telaxians need is a leader who can help them defend their home. Neelix then departs in his shuttle and helps them set up a shield around the asteroid. Having grown close to one of the women there he decides to stay with them and be the Federation's ambassador in the Delta Quadrant.This was a good episode which saw the first departure of a major character since Kes left at the start of season four. Over the years Ethan Phillips did a fine job as Neelix, a character who could be a little annoying at times but overall was a fun character. This episode is also the last to feature young Naomi Wildman, to my mind the best Star Trek child as Scarlett Pomers played her as a normal child. The final scene between them was quite touching.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Homestead (TV Episode 2001)",A necessary episode,"Voyager could not return to the Alpha Quadrant with a native Delta Quadrant resident on board. The whole point of the series is that Voyager's crew is trying to get home to their own people. Once it was determined that Voyager was not going to be renewed for another season, the producers decided to wrap up the loose ends: Tom and Ba'llana's baby, the Doctor's status, Seven's humanity, Harry's insistence to get home, and Neelix's future. This was a chance for the crew and for the audience to say good-bye to Neelix within the plot of an episode that would leave him with his people, yet still accessible to Voyager (as a permanent ambassador to the D quad). The final goodbye scene where Neelix leaves the turbolift and walks through the corridors lined with the Voyager crew is one of the most poignant in the series.",10
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Homestead (TV Episode 2001)",Touching,"Even when there is an inconsistent series like this one, one gains an attachment to it. The characters live and breathe and we get to know them. I have to say my reaction to Neelix is sort of the same as Tuvok's. He is sincere but can be so annoying and, at times, clueless when it comes to social interactions (he can't take a hint). Still, he provided color and flair to the show. I always had trouble because I thought his head looked like a slow-pitch softball, but that's another issue. I forgot that his ship was still in dry dock and available to him. He obviously had technical skills and expertise in the ways of he galaxy. When he is given responsibilities, he is able to adapt to situations, even dire ones. Here we have him reconnecting with his species. Remember that his family and a huge number of Talaxians were the victims of genocide. He has been willing to combat his loneliness out of gratitude for his situation. Remember, at one point he nearly committed suicide. Anyway, I found this an extremely poignant farewell to an interesting character.",9
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Homestead (TV Episode 2001)",Touching Farewell with missed opportunities,"NOTE: This is more of a criticism than a review, but I hope you find it useful!!I was pleased to see during the opening credits that this episode was directed by the famous ""Geordi La Forge"" from The Next Generation (real life = LeVar Burton).The Good: Neelix encounters his own kind, bonds with them, and ultimately leads them to stand against a greedy mining cartel. Overall a good episode, but there are 3 things which made it ""not great""...1. I always thought shuttle crafts were used too infrequently in the Star Trek series, and when they would appear, they would almost always be casually traveling through space (or rarely, an atmosphere). So I was pleased to see this episode using a shuttle for a good purpose (to investigate an asteroid field too dangerous for the ""large"" Voyager spaceship).I mostly liked the scene where the shuttle crash-lands on the asteroid. This seems very believable, and the FX are very good for the time, but somehow it still looked a bit fake. I am not sure if this a poor ""model"" shot, or ""sub-par"" CGI, but either way the shuttle crash scene ended with non-convincing visuals. On the other hand, I must say that except for the final seconds of the crash scene, the shuttle appeared very believable!2. Near the end of the episode, Neelix (who lost weapons on his ship) decides to heroically defend the asteroid colony by putting his ship in the path of an enemy torpedo. Sadly (my opinion), his heroism is nullified by a surprise appearance of the Delta Flyer which destroys the enemy's projectile. Sad because there was *no* need for Cpt.Janeway to magically come to the rescue... I believe Neelix's ship, which had undamaged shields (according to the story we see) could have survived the impact of the enemy (without outside help). Can you say anti-climatic? Or perhaps counter-climatic? Either way, Neelix was robbed of his heroic moment... FOR SHAME!!!3. The final scene shows Neelix walking through Voyager's corridors lined with Voyager crew members. At first (and overall), I found this scene very touching. The crew decided to give a standing ovation to a person who will be missed... my eyes got very teary in this scene! However, at the end of the corridors, he sees the senior staff and friends... Now I think this is typical for a dramatic TV show, but what amazed me (in a negative way) is that he didn't hug or kiss anybody goodbye! Well maybe Telaxians aren't like humans, but really, how could he leave without giving a heartfelt speech to young Naomi? Even a small hug or kiss on the cheek with a simple line like ""I will always remember you"" would suffice... but he just walks past her without a word. Cold...So the above are my 3 ""note-worthy"" criticisms. Now that I think about it, it was annoying that Neelix and his female Telaxian (Dexa?) often wanted (or so it appeared) to be intimate, but nothing happened until the very final seconds of the episode... where we get to see a hug. Hmmm....ANYWAY, I really enjoyed this episode for the most part, but those 3 issues mentioned above broke my sense of disbelief... the episode wasn't totally ruined because of those issues, but it could have been much better......so 8 of 10.",8
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Homestead (TV Episode 2001)",Neelix leaves and Tuvok is going to be crying his eyes out....inside.,"This is the final episode for Neelix. As the series was winding down, the decision was made by some writers to ditch this guy in the Delta Quadrant. My wife cried. I was a bit less overwhelmed by his loss.When the show begins, Voyager encounters a hidden group of 500 Talaxian refugees hiding out under the surface of some planet. Considering how few of them are left, it's perhaps the last chance for these people to avoid extinction. However, some race of bullies wants the planet and considering how weak and few the Talaxians are, things look really bad. That is, until Neelix comes to the rescue. Their plight is now his plight and he's not about to knuckle under to these jerk-faces. So he decides to help them and eventually stays with them and Voyager continues on to the Alpha Quadrant.This is a pretty good show--full of heart and one that fans of the series probably will find a tad upsetting.",8
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Renaissance Man (TV Episode 2001)",Too over the top,"The premise of this episode really does not quite make sense. The Doctor has now matured for seven years. He would not freeze away crew members and impersonate them to save the Captain from some alien traders holding her hostage to obtain a warp drive - and only the Doctor knows about it!The episode would not have fitted earlier in the series because the Doctor would not have had the attachment to do what he does here. It does not fit later in the series because the Doctor has a lot of experience and understands that such a situation is best resolved working with the crew. And no, the feeble excuse that the aliens can see what he sees and hear what he hears is not enough to explain it: he communicates with the crew in subtle ways at the end, so why not right away? He's not stupid, you know.The episode is still sort of silly fun as the Doctor tries to imitate B'Elana, Chakotay and other assorted characters he's stowing away in the ship's morgue as they catch on to his scheme to save the captain alone while sacrificing the warp drive. And it features those bumbling aliens from The Hive, who have decided to become highway robbers. So if you take it in the vein of a comedic escapade at the penultimate tick of the clock of Voyager's final season, it's OK. Hence still a 5.If you like The Hive and the Doctor, watch the ""Tinker, Tenor, Soldier, Spy"" episode again and see how it's done right.",5
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Renaissance Man (TV Episode 2001)",The Doctor disobeys orders,On their way back from an away mission Janeway and the Doctor run into a few difficulties. Once back on Voyager the captain tells Chakotay that they have accidentally strayed into the territory of a species which does not allow warp travel and is demanding the surrender of their warp core. He suggests making a run for it but she insists they must obey as the alien species has cloaked ships and superior weapons. Reluctantly he follows her orders but when she starts to act strangely he goes to see the Doctor so he can give her a check up. Later he claims to have seen her and determined that there is nothing wrong with her health. Chakotay goes to see the captain and realises that the person in front of him isn't Captain Janeway. Before he can do anything though he is drugged and hidden in the ship's morgue. At this point we learn that the captain was in fact the Doctor who has been working with two aliens to steal Voyager's warp core in exchange for the captain who they are holding captive. As he proceeds he impersonates further crew members until he finally gets his hand on the core. Once he hands it over he finds that the aliens have no intention of honouring their side of the bargain and ends up a captive alongside the captain.This was a fun Doctor led episode... although for the first quarter that wasn't obvious as he was impersonating the captain. Once we realised he was impersonating various crew members it was fun to see the hints he gave to who he really was; such as when he is pretending to be B'Elanna and tells Tom the food he is giving her is unhealthy. It was also fun to see him confessing his various misdemeanours when he thinks his program is about to decompile.,8

This starts with a sort-end-of the-road event, reporting the potential destruction of Voyager and the resettlement of its crew. A formidable adversary proves, however, to be anything but. Instead, we are reintroduced to those two fat guys from a previous episode. They are scroungers and have come up with a plan to get the warp core from our favorite starship. They have kidnapped the Captain and the Doc and are using the holographic talents of the transparent physician to manipulate the crew. Soon he is impersonating just about the entire main staff. This has some fun stuff in it, and the Doctor's confessions at the conclusion are quite hilarious. But the episode seems so out of place and so far fetched, even in the Voyager world, that it hardly seems possible. I look forward to the conclusion. It certainly has been a circumlocative path to this point.",7
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Renaissance Man (TV Episode 2001)",I think the Doctor was very poorly written in this episode....very poorly.,"I really did NOT like this episode as the Doctor's character really behaved irrationally. So much of what he did simply made very little sense. When the show begins, the Captain mentions that they'll be jettisoning the warp core and moving to a planet nearby! Her reason for this seems silly and through the course of the show, she acts batty. It's because down deep it ISN'T her but the Doctor posing as her! In fact, he then poses as several other crew members--all in order to steal the ship's warp core. Why he's done all this is explained but his logic sure seems faulty and stupid. Overall, this is a very weak episode--the sort that make you feel that it was about time to end the series--which occurs in the following episode. The only real positive part of the show is when the Doctor thinks he's dying and he makes some funny confessions.",4
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Renaissance Man (TV Episode 2001)",A clear example of how stupid decisions and insubordination are encouraged in voyager,"So, you're the doctor, an hologram.
You're with the captain in a shuttle, and it's attacked.
The captain is held hostage, and they're going to kill her if you don't do what the attackers want (two pathetic aliens). She orders you to not comply, and to inform the crew of their plans.
So, what do you do? Exactly the opposite of what your captain ordered you.
You attack several of your comrades, eject the core, rendering Voyager defenseless, and then you go to exchange the core for your captain's life, but instead of that, you're taken prisioner also.
The only thing that made sense, is that the doctor leaved a secret message with a way to find them, so they manage to rescue them with a shuttle (because Voyager is disabled) and a lot of luck.All of this could be avoided by simply telling the crew what was happening. They can kill the captain, but then nothing stops the Voyager from turning them into sub-atomical particles, so that would be a really stupid decision to be made by the aliens.So, what happens after everyone returns to the ship? No effective penalty for the doctor, that's for sure! Even if that's kind of a cout martial kind of behaviour, which endangered the ship and the lives of everyone, but hey! it's Voyager, what did you expected!? Not even restraining of the doc's program, nor disabling the ""command mode"" which gave him enough security autorization to eject the core!!So, this episode tells us that the doctor is just another time bomb inside Voyager, waiting to explode at any time. As if the incredibly violent delta quadrant wasn't enough!!",3
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Renaissance Man (TV Episode 2001)",Dreadful episode,"While I'm a fan of Voyager there are times when Star Trek really does make laughable story choices. This is absolutely one of those times. The poor writing and total lack of continuity in character development is a classic example of just how bad writing can get. The total nonsense of the storyline, that doesn't have a complete conclusion with there being no repercussions for the Doctor, makes for very painful, watching.

0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)","I was satisfied, I want more though!","The past few months I have collected Voyager seasons 4 to 7 on DVD (I only had 1 to 3 on video before that, because Kes is my favourite character) and have just reached the end. I saw them when they were originally shown on TV here in the UK but had forgotten most of it. Am I satisfied with the ending? I think I am. Naturally as I fan I would have liked to have seen more about what happened to the characters when they got home but that's left to our imagination. In many ways ""Endgame"" is similar to Next Gen's ""All Good Things"" The involvement of the crew in the future, but mainly the captain. A new romance starting in the finale (Troi and Worf in Next Gen and Seven of Nine and Chakotay here), which results in death in the future. I truly loved ""Endgame,"" fair to all characters, Neelix appears although he left the ship two episodes earlier. B'elanna gives birth to her daughter with loving husband Tom. Tuvok is ill but returning home means he can be cured. Harry has always been the most anxious and determined but admits the journey is important. The Doctor, in the future, is well respected by all and finally chooses the name Joe! But of course the Captain has the largest role, meeting her future self who wants to get the crew home earlier to prevent casualties. The Borg are involved, as they have played a massive part in this period of Voyager. Alice Krige plays the Borg Queen again fantastically, just her voice and acting method are magnificent. I feel sorry for Susanna Thompson though, the TV Borg queen replaced by the movie Borg queen. Maybe she wasn't available though. The special effects are fantastic, the Borg sub space hub and the Borg queen falling apart! It's very tense. Especially when they come out of the Borg subspace corridor and say their location is right where they thought they'd be after they'd said they'd have to go in a corridor that leads back to the delta quadrant. And what a wonderful idea to get inside a Borg sphere for protection, on the DVD special features they say it was like the Trojan horse. Voyager could have continued. If it was more popular they would have stuck with their original idea of the crew realising the ship is their home, like in Harry's speech and what Tom said because his wife and child are there. And then they could have got home in a film!Overall, Voyager was a bit hit and miss. The sixth season seemed to be one good one followed by one less than good one. The two episodes set in the Holographic Irish village are horrible! My perception of Seven of Nine was that she took over, it all revolved around her, which wasn't true. When she first appeared, season 4 was focused on her for too many of the episodes but it evened out after that. And her character is ingenious at times, 20 years as a Borg drone gradually rediscovering her humanity. I like her, especially in ""Someone to Watch Over Me,"" ""Imperfection,"" and ""Human Error."" When Naomi Wildman was scared of her initially but then became her friend often by her side, that was lovely. Chakotay became my least favourite character. Gone was the chemistry with Janeway (will they/won't they?) and you'd never think he was first officer, he's completely pushed aside most of the time. I loved seeing Tom and B'elanna's relationship blossom against the odds. I always liked Neelix a lot. Tuvok was good at times, especially when he lost his logic, gained emotion and was friends with Neelix. Harry was annoying at times but a okay character at other times. The Doctor is probably my favourite, seeing how far he comes and comedy situations he creates (""Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy"" is fantastic!). Janeway is my favourite Captain of any series and you can tell Kate Mulgrew is really enjoying it. I wish there was more, I love Voyager!",8
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",Thank you Star Trek for making Voyager,"I was not really a big fan of Star Trek until past 2-3 years. Thanks to the advent of Netflix and post 2000 video technology distribution, I am able to embark into the past of all the great Star Trek episodes. For those that don't really watch every single episode and know them by heart, through TNG, DS9, Voyager, etc., general popular consensus will say -- ""I like The Next Generation"" the best. That's because Captain Picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of Star Trek starvation. But to be quiet honest, I appreciate the creativity of Voyager's episodes more than TNG. Voyager's episodes also progresses through time unlike TNG. Granted Data from TNG is great but it eventually gets old but Voyager's doctor -- now that's creativity! Instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky, give him the freedom to express beyond anything you imagined. Not only is Picardo such a great actor but the premise setting for his expansive, self growth, as a doctor, self realization now that is science fiction at its best! Endgame portray him as a husband married to an ""organic"", inventing neuro-implant transceiver for human-machine interface, and even -- in the episode before Endgame, to disobey Captain's order and make ""human"" mistakes. Unlike DS9 which are blessed with 2 beautiful women right from 1st episode, Voyager has to survive 3 seasons without Jeri Ryan and I believe it is Picardo that carried them with his personality. Of course the rest of the Voyager's cast chemistry just flows effortless, Harry Kim and Tom Paris -- very natural. I love Tuvoc occasional humor, despite being a Vulcan. Finally, I'm so glad they got rid of that original female captain -- oh, if you get to watch the rare footage -- thank God for Kate! She has developed through the 7 years into an extremely confident, believable, and respectable female captain. What a GREAT job! Thank you Star Trek for making Voyager, I enjoy every episode, the creative exploration of possibilities, of morals, and of our Cosmic expanse.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)","One for the fans, sort of","""Endgame"", like most series finales, is an episode entirely for the fans..and yet in the last few minutes, the writers fail to give the fans a pleasing little coda that would make us all well up with tears. In a way it makes sense: the premise of the series is that the crew wants to get home and so it ends the moment they get home. But it still would have been nice to see Janeway gather everyone together for one rousing little moment.You should watch this episode when you're in a forgiving mood: the Chakotay / Seven of Nine romance comes more or less out of left field. Certainly the writers have hinted at it in two previous episodes (Human Error and Natural Law); now all of the sudden the two are having their ""third"" date. It's a little sloppy, like the rushed ending.The major plot problem, sadly, is pointed out by the Borg Queen in her final moments, which feels like it was the character getting revenge for being killed. She remarks that once her Borg cube has killed Janeway, then the future Janeway will never exist and hence everything she's accomplished will be erased. But the same thing is accomplished if the Borg Queen lets the younger Janeway get home: for of course, this means that she won't have any reason to go back in time to change her past. It's not that I care the writers chose to ignore the paradox of time travel: it's just funny that they would so blatantly call our attention to it.In a way this episode was quintessential Voyager: goofy, slightly illogical, and yet nonetheless engaging and fun. There were good episodes and bad ones, but on average they hit more balls then they missed. They also did much for the advancement of hologram rights: I mean, this episode shows the Doctor has married a human. This in itself boggles the mind and practically begs for a spin off series: I mean just think what you could do with their children.",8
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",A great ending to the series,"Some series finales stink, but this one is about as non-stinky as you can get. In fact, this double-length show is among the best in the series--something very rare for any finale.When the show begins, you learn that Voyager was gone a total of 23 years and has now been back on Earth a decade. The Captain is now an admiral and she's quite gray. However, she also has a secret plan-- one that is not acceptable to the powers that be because it's playing fast and loose with the temporal time directive. What her plan is eventually comes to light--she plans to somehow go through time to Voyager in the seventh year of its voyage home. Then, giving them technology from the future, it will allow Voyager both to kick the crap out the Borg AND use their technology to get to Earth 18 years earlier--and, in doing this, save several members of the crew who died during the 23 year trip.This episode has everything going for it. This older Janeway is NOT the touch-feely nice lady she was in the rest of the series--she was VERY willing to play fast and loose with the rules. Plus, she seemed very willing to commit mass genocide against the Borg. This is EXACTLY what most fans of the series probably always wanted and it makes for a very exciting and fun episode that isn't to be missed.",10
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",The end of an era,"After seven years Star Trek Voyager comes to an end with this double length episode. The episode opens at a celebration to mark the tenth anniversary of Voyager's return to Earth after a twenty three year long journey back from the Delta Quadrant. There are noticeable absences though and we soon learn that Seven of Nine died in the Delta Quadrant, Chakotay made it back but was never the same after Seven's death and died on Earth and Tuvok has had an emotional breakdown due to an illness which could have been treated in the Alpha Quadrant but not in the Delta Quadrant. Janeway, now an admiral is working on acquiring a device that will enable her to return to the Delta Quadrant at a time when they are close to a Borg transwarp hub which could get them home in minutes. Once back the admiral still has to persuade her younger self that it is possible for them to go up against the Borg and get home, she must also convince herself to use the hub rather than destroying it. Ultimately the two of them come up with an idea which may serve both of these goals although it would call for an act of self sacrifice from the admiral. In a secondary story we B'Elanna gives birth to a daughter who will grew up to help the admiral acquire technology from the Klingons.This episode provided a good if somewhat rushed conclusion to the series, I was pleased that it ended as soon as the were within sight of Earth rather than showing us celebrations and discussions about what they each plan to do now they are back home. Kate Mulgrew did a fine job in the duel roles of Captain and Admiral Janeway, Alice Krige made a welcome return as the Borg Queen, the scenes between her and Janeway were great; I'm pleased that they picked a suitably iconic villain for the final episode... and even more pleased that they didn't mirror the more popular 'Next Generation' by having Q involved. I think that after seven years it was probable the right time to end the series, it left me with fond memories and wanting more not thinking it had dragged on too long.",8
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",A Great Ending Not So Great or...,"Well first of all, this comment concerns only the last episode which started great but ends so suddenly, like in 5 minutes, was a little telegraphic like a trailer of a movie or sort... and it left me in air for a while. I had the feeling like wasting time with the series. Probably the director woudn't like to end this nice saga with a cliché like many others with a nice homecoming party or something. But as i said, i shed no tears, i wish i would but i couldn't, like i did after seeing the last episode of TNG, i think it deserved a little fancy speech from the cpt. Janeway or other crewmen. Or in the other way, i wished i could be happy for them, but i couldn't. It was like the borg, no feelings induced.Now, what about the ""no harming other species"" phrase ? Janeway infected the borg with some kinda virus and kills or incapacitates all of them. Or not all of them ? What happens with them? It is somehow contrairing with her previous actions regarding the borg and other species. Or could it be because she is a little older now and she becomes more eager to redeem herself because she didn't want the crew of Voyager to spend another 23 years in the Delta Quadrant bicoz of her fault (or not). Again, this leads to her action against borg. At first she didn't want the caretaker's device to come in other hands and to be used against other species, and now he kills the borg. What about the Federation rules which she respects throughout all these 7 years like a religion ? In my opinion, Voyager series and TNG, i think it deserved a more elaborate ending which should be prepared with an episode or two ahead. I have no experience in making movies :) but after all of these years of hard work from their behalf, i guess it deserved more.",
6,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",So disappointing,"After eagerly waiting to the end, I have to say I wish I wouldn't have joined the whole series at the first place. The final episode was everything against the previous seven years. It has ruined everything. The journey was 23 years, but captain Janeway has the power to reduce it... let say, seven years only. Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? Crewmemebers were dying all along the journey. Why she wants to save Seven of Nine only? The others don't count or what? The most ridiculous part when the crew states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them. As the say, ""journey is more important than the destination"". Unbelievable. And at the finale scene the are surrounded by other Federation ships and the Earth is in sight. Nothing about landing, returning to the normal life.Worst ending ever.",1
7,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",A Great Ending to a Great Family,"This is a great ending to the show. The fact that Adm. Janeway was able to do a double switch on the Borg was great. The fact that she allowed herself to be infected, thus infecting the Queen with a ""poison"" that in, essence, ended the Borg was great. The way they ended it also left some, not a lot, for a reunion movie. However, they did bring them ""home"" and the way they did it was fantastic!! It was sad to say good bye to a part of my family. Ending it with Tom and B'Lanna having their baby just as they enter the Alpha quad. was a great way to show a new beginning. It would be nice to have a reunion movie of some type - just to see where their characters would be today.",10
8,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",Fitting end,"SPOILERS. Like other posters, I felt that the ending was a bit abrupt. I would have liked to have seen the crew adjusting to life back on earth after their return. I suppose the writers anticipated this problem by ""front loading"" some Voyager on earth sequences at the beginning of the episode. (Of course, that time line has been eradicated, so it's all moot.) I did like how Admiral Janeway died for the Voyager crew. As fans, we get to have our cake and eat it to, by having Janeway both make the ultimate sacrifice and live on. I admit that the scenes of Janeway and her older self having conversations was bizarre and so easily could have crossed the line into camp. Fortunately, Mulgrew(s) pulled it off.",8
9,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",Future Howlin Mad Broccoli and Janeway ram a show home.,"This show has a multiplex storyline - Janeway in the Future teaches Borg 101 at Starfleet Tech alongside Howlin Mad Broccoli. ""Doctor Joe"" has finally taken a name after 30 years and has gotten Married to a Human, and Tom and B'elanna's daughter is Future Janeway's access to a secret weapon she needs to use to get to where Voyager is in this ep. Janeway has to basically steal this thing from a Klingon named Korath (Vaughn Armstrong's 3rd or 4th Voyager Appearance).In Voyager's current timeline, they have found the treasure of all Borg treasures, and for this and only this episode, the main Borg Queen, Alice Krige, happens to be the Queen in charge.I'm sure Susanna Thompson could have pulled it off, But I've always seen Alice as the Queen of Borg Queens, so it was fitting for her to make this appearance. We know that these Queens can't ever really be killed, they'll just keep being re-grown. And maybe Queen B, Susanna, after fouling up Unimatrix Zero, was demoted for having Janeway kick her arse so much.But the question is, what has Voyager stumbled into? They find a nexus of what seem to be Wormholes inside of a Nebula - A Nebula riddled with Borg Cubes. Alice Queen is very protective of it, and won't let Janeway anywhere near it..Meanwhile, Seven of Sixty-Nine is actually dating Chakotay, despite the danger of her implants overloading due to Human Emotions. and B'elanna is about to drop a progeny, right in the middle of a firefight!This last Voyager episode has everything in it, I was pleased to see it when it was broadcast, I was shocked at the quality, and I still am. This finale is almost as good as Deep Space Nine's as far as wrapping up a bunch of little details, and Dwight Schultz was practically a cast member by this time.But the twist of all twists is the secret of what's really in the Nebula, we've seen it in use in Next Generation and in earlier eps of Voyager. Now we get to actually SEE how Borg can move about the Galaxy so quickly, and it's all based on an idea first referred to in Star Trek III- Something we never really got to see until Next Generation's 6th and 7th seasons.From the first time we see the Borg in Next Generation to this episode, no other Trek show handled the Borg as well as Voyager: They had become more than Mindless Automatons, due to Seven's addition as a crewmember. So I salute this series, as it went out with a much bigger bang than it made when it came on the air with ""Caretaker"" - Even Next Generation and Deep Space Nine end at their beginnings, so to speak. But Voyager never pointed to anywhere else but the Future, which is where Trek should have kept going instead of backtracking it's own past in Enterprise.",10
10,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",Nice to Be Home but Don't Think Too Much,"For the last time in this series, time travel is involved, and the consequences of the mutation of time is ignored. Because of Admiral Janeway's unhappiness and the loss of Seven in her time, she steals some Klingon technology and goes off to change the past. Once again the Borg are the bad guys, and need to be dealt with. One of the critics says that Janeway commits genocide. I think that is simplistic as the Borg are on a mission of conquest to destroy and assimilate everyone that exists. Although I enjoyed the closure, it would take a book to go through the errors that occurred here, starting with two Janeways being on board the same ship. Just focus on that. I think Einstein would be put to the test. The crew has spent all those years trying to get home and yet they make a pact and ignore the biggest gift horse ever. And are the Borg really gone since they seem to be done in by a futuristic Janeway. Oh well. It was certainly fun anyway.",8

The show deserved a better ending.The overall two part ending had the right pacing, tension and drama, and kept the story exciting. However, I feel for a show that had been running for 7 full seasons the final segment fell pretty flat. I was really expecting some sort of awesome all out battle between the Federation's armada and the Borg sphere; maybe have a happy reunion of families and friends. Instead they popped back into the Alpha Quadrant. And that was it. Roll credits.I could have also absolutely done without the forced romance between Seven and Chakotay; especially since there was a much, much better and more natural chemistry between him and Janeway. I felt it was extremely cringe worthy and read more like a basic 'fan fiction' level of writing. I binge watched this show so the change in romance interests for Chakotay seemed really out of the blue.Overall, the show is amazing and by far one of my forever favorites – but I can't get over how unsatisfying and underwhelming this ending was.""Set a course, for home""",9
12,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",Lackluster hooray........,"I love this show. It is my favourite in the Star Trek world except the original series. Too bad the writers went the ""we don't want to fall into the sappy, captain gives a heroic speech, ticket tape parade trite ending"" that most shows would naturally do. They went the Sopranos ending route and tried to change it up and not form to convention. yes, you can be bold and take that route but you also have to pay the piper if that route fails. I doubt David Chase can go anywhere even years later without a fan coming up and saying, ""WTF guy! I felt stiffed!"" When you have a 2 or 3 hour film you can play that card BUT when you have the finale show after a 7 year run that is ALSO part of a huge fan based universe for the past 40+ years, you have to pay off some debts buddy. Like it or not it is emotionally satisfying having those moments and when you cheat your audience by not showing them at all because you don't as filmmakers want to present the same old same old, then you can't complain when you are dragged out on the carpet for it. Your job is to present it in in a non-sappy way by use of writing, acting and directing skills to satisfy an audience, not to re-invent the wheel.",5
13,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",a rushed finale!,"It appears the writers got the information about the termination of the contract for the series on a very short notice!They not only produced an episode that was clearly rushed but also contradicted many of the past episodes involving time travel, and commits a time travel paradox (also recognized as such in past episodes) which by definition would be impossible: if Janeway was to be successful in her reckless plan as it appears to be the case at the end, how could her sad self exist to get back in time to execute it in the first place? Besides, where are time cops from 29th century to stop her?I enjoyed the series very much but the finale left a sour taste that I still cannot forget; hence my review here to vent.",4
14,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",Janeway commits genocide and breaks the Prime and Temporal Directives,"And so Voyager finishes almost as badly as it started, in which Janeway once again shows her flexibility regarding the Prime and Temporal directives, and commits genocide to further her own ends. Where were the Time Agents in this episode? How could Janeway have become an Admiral after this? Like much of Voyager this is an ill-considered, inconsistent mess. There was also no real closure for the characters, in ST:DS9 this was somewhat over the top in the final story, but at least it was present.Having the Borg as the villains at the end was a good idea squandered with an awful plot. Good bye Voyager, and good riddance.",2
15,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",Merely Acceptable,"After 7 seasons, I was expecting a fantastic ending, but this two-part finale was merely acceptable. Overall it was a decent story, but the directing and writing was both derivative and lacking...It is derivative because of its extreme similarity to TNG's finale ""All Good Things"": the show opens with a future version of reality (which will never occur) then we (the audience) go back in time with the Captain (now Admiral) and change things ""for the better"" (while ignoring the temporal paradox this creates).So the future (about 25 years after the current time) Admiral Janeway steels federation technology and travels to Voyager's past. She argues with the current Captain Janeway about directives/morals, and gives the old/current Voyager advanced technology. Note I think this is (so far) pretty good story, even if it is derivative.Next the Janeways agree to invade a nebula controlled by the Borg. This would normally be suicide for Voyager, but thanks to future technology, Voyager shakes off all Borg attacks and arrives at a ""trans-warp hub"". Again, this is pretty entertaining...But once Voyager arrives at this important Borg hub, the two Janeways enter a moral/ethical dispute... which is dramatic (and understandable) but also stupid... they spend several minutes near a vital Borg resource without being attacked! Did the Borg suddenly loose interest in Voyager? Does Voyager have some kind of cloaking device that the cast and writers forgot to mention to the audience? Anyway, Admiral Janeway is captured by the Borg Queen, while Voyager and Captain Janeway proceed through the trans-warp hub. The interesting thing (to me) is they are just picking a route at random... any conduit that takes them to the Alpha Quadrant. (I find this entertaining sci-fi...) The Borg Queen assimilates Admiral Janeway, but the future Janeway anticipated this, and is carrying an infection that kills the Borg Queen (and presumably infects all Borg in that sector).Meanwhile, a Borg Sphere chases after Voyager through the trans-warp corridor, and Starfleet amasses an armada of ships to intercept the Borg Sphere. It was kind of cool to see all those federation ships, but it was totally stupid because they had no idea where Voyager would emerge in the Alpha Quadrant (also there was not enough time to amass such a fleet).The series finale ends with Voyager emerging from the conduit in the Alpha Quadrant with debris of the Borg Sphere flying everywhere. That is: Voyager destroyed the sphere, the federation armada never fired a single shot. Kind of lame... Then in the final scene we see Voyager approaching Earth.That's it... there is no final ""welcome home"" or ""congratulations"" speech. This is most disappointing to a fan like me... after 7 years, it would be nice to have a few minutes to ""decompress."" The ending was sorely lacking in an emotional way...In summary, a mostly entertaining (if derivative) story with a lack-luster ending. Many series end without a proper finale, and those with a finale are often poor. So I wish this would have been better, but I still view it as acceptable.My problem is Voyager deserved better than acceptable.",8
16,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",Great Ending,"This is a top-class episode. It has the right amount of tension, the story and pacing are interesting and exciting. Its difficult to pin down exactly what makes this such a great episode. Kate Mulgrew's acting is truly superb as she plays her Admiral self with such confidence and daring, its a treat to watch great acting like that. Its fun to see B'ellana's child as an young (hot) adult. Perhaps its always fun to get a skip ahead or see an alternative version of the people we are used to. The plan is daring and exciting, and its great to see the Borg get kicked around a bit. 'All good things...' (TNG) was a great end episode also, but this one is a little better. I preferred Voyager's more overarching story line to the single episode premise as was TNG. I always wondered why they didn't do more of a continuing story and was very disappointed to find out its the Ass Hats that wanted the single-episode story format for future syndication purposes, so they were more concerned about selling the show as a by-product in the future than actually making the best and most out of the shows potential... ick.",10

18,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",At last!',"At long last this series was coming to an end. I thought this show had far too many low points. It had flashes of brilliance once or twice every season but should have ended at season 5 or earlier. This end episode was a little too similarly themed to Next Gen's colossal 'All Good Things'. In saying that it was an action packed show with a welcome return for Alice Krige as the Borg Queen. The action was first rate and the crew were at their best and ended in the way the viewer would have wanted. In my opinion this show would have gained so much more respect if Seven had, at the last moment turned on the crew and they were all assimilated and the closing scene had Seven and the Borg Queen standing over the crew, in full Borg mode saying 'We are Borg'!!",6
19,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",The ending you would expect for this series... not a good one,"Ok, so the episode goes like this:It starts on the Earth, 10 years after the Voyager arrives, which took 23 years.
They're home, but not everything is ok, Tuvok has lost his mind (neurodegenerative disease), Chakotay is dead, and so is 7 of 9.So, future almirant Janeway has a plan: she gets some time-traveling gear, and goes back in time with her shuttle.Back to the present, Voyager encounters a nebula with a lot of wormholes inside, so they investigate, but there are a lot of Borg nearby, so they go away.Future Janeway makes them a visit (they play safe by checking that this is for real, and not some impostor), and gives them the tech to protect Voyager from the Borg, and just get into the nebula and take the wormhole home. The Borg simply sit there while they upgrade Voyager, instead of taking the tech for themselves and assimilate the heck out of everyone there, for some reason.But when they're inside the nebula, they find that the wormholes are part of the Borg transwarp grid, which is composed of 6 ""wormhole balls"" like this one. So, young Javeway gets indignated with her older self for not telling her, and orders the ship out of the nebula, with the wormhole to get home just in their noses. The crew obeys for some stupid reason. Old Janeway outranks young Janeway after all. I must mention here that Voyager took quite some damage to his new anti-borg shielding, so retreating wasn't the best idea in the world, because there were still a lot of borg cubes in the vecinity, and also because they have anti-borg tech with them and an individual with knowledge from the future which would be a great addition to the Borg.Also, we get to know that Tuvok already has this sickness, and the only ones that could cure them are other Vulcans from his own family, but there's a time frame to do that, that's why he couldn't be saved in the future, because they took a lot of time to get there.So, what's the plan now? Young Janeway has her usual delusions of greatness, and now want to take out the whole Borg transwarp grid!!! WTF?!?!? The crew agrees, by saying that that will save a lot of lives (but won't the Borg just rebuild this and then go to destroy the threat of Earth anyways?) . So after discussing some more with old Janeway, they decide to go with a plan that old Janeway discarded for been too risky, but what the hell, her encounter with her young version has grown on her nostalgia, and now she feels like going with this insane plan.So, Voyager goes for the wormhole at the same time B'Elana is giving birth, because who needs a chief engineer in the middle of a battle with the Borg after all? Had they escaped before, they would be on Earth already, but now she's on labor while all of this transpires. The plan is to take the grid out from the inside by firing their new torpedoes, but for that to work, Old Janeway went to her shuttle before, and uses some deus ex machina chip in her brain to communicate with the Borg queen, offering her to give her the way to resist the new torpedoes, if she promises to get Voyager safe to Earth, and that she don't try to find her, because she's using new tech and she wont be able to do it. The queen finds old Janeway anyways, and begins to assimilate her, but that was the plan all along, as she carries some anti-borg neuro-tech virus that destroys even the queen and everything borg in sight. It's difficult to say for sure, but i think this is supposed to take down the entire borg collective. So they seemed to do what Picard didn't when he refused to commint genocide, even if the Borg are a threat, they're just another species.At the same time, Voyager was inside the wormhole, and was chased by a Borg sphere. As Voyager was damaged before, now it's in danger. The wormhole exit appears on Earth and Starfleet sounds all alarms, and sends some ships there, fearing a Borg invasion.The queen says to old Janeway that the sphere will destroy Voyager, so her young self will die, won't have a future, and so what old Janeway did won't happen anyways (that's probably the only accurate time-paradox sentence in the whole series).Voyager is unsure if it can make to the Earth exit, and considers to take an early exit to the Delta Quadrant (but why? the Borg would pursue them anyways), and to prepare to change course, but the borg sphere opens it's bay, and seems ready to engulf Voyager. Next thing we see, is that the sphere arrives at Earth, and Starfleet shoots the hell out of it.We're with Voyager again, they mention that they're ""where they supposed they would be"", and after some silly seconds, we realize that Voyager changed course to position to the back of the sphere, and is actually in Earth too.THE ENDA far cry from Deep Space's 9 ending when we get to see what happens with every important character.And the worst of it, is that as the Borg Queen said, now there's no need for Janeway to go back in time, so this is a paradox, and will unmade itself. But of course this doesn't happen on the series, either because the writers didn't realized it, or they subestimated their audience.There wasn't any need for all this cheesy ill-executed time travel stuff, not to mention the genocide.

I really don't know how anyone can say the finale to this series is 'good' when it first came out it broke my heart how awful it was. I thought it had to be a joke, some kind of parody, and the real ending to the series would probably be released at a later date but no such luck.If you look very carefully at the end when Voyager is being chased through a Borg ship, the Borg ship is destroyed for no apparent reason and Voyager makes it through the wormhole.

So, many times I will watch a series and the last show ends up being a cliffhanger with no proper ending. I am left hanging after investing quite a lot of time in a world that is so busy that we have less and less time TO invest. Anyway, I loved how Janeway blasts through Borg cubes like they were made of cardboard with the new Quantum Torpedoes, and the addition of armor was long overdue for the entire series. I liked the going back and forth through time plot, and the aging crew members makeup was believable and the acting competent.The unbelievable portion was the Borg sending only one cube. Bullsnot.

I hated the fact the Janeway was apparently more of a bad guy than the bad guy she was so heck bent on tracking down. The only thing that made it watchable was Ransom's transformation from the person we saw who stopped at nothing to continue, to the person who stopped at nothing to end things. In a previous episode(Scorpion) Janeway had stopped and listened in time to prevent a disaster; here she had to stop and watch the disaster unfold before she finally listened.Anyway on watching it a second time as it were, I realized there was a reason and a story to what was going on. It was a look into the lack of black and white ethics: the ""bad guy"" has a conscience and the protagonist seems to have left hers behind. There really is no black and white absolute when it comes to morals and ethics. Where do we stand on the issue? Personally I stand by the captain, when she has her head screwed on right that is. Nod to Chakotay for being respectful even as the single crew member to stand up to this.Question: level 10 authorization is captains eyes only, shouldn't the first officer have level 9? is this some sort of odd mention of former lack of trust? Or did we not know of level 10 yet?",
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Equinox: Part II (TV Episode 1999)",Excellent two parter.,"Voyager finds another Federation starship, the USS Equinox, stranded in the Delta Quadrant. Equinox is a gritty dark episode directed By David Livingston with some excellent sets, good visual effects and weighty acting notably from John Savage as Captain Ransom and Kate Mulgrew.This episode continues edginess, people dead or dying and you get the feeling things may not play out well. There's action, Wrath of Khan-like double cross with creepy and vicious CGI-created aliens. Writers Rick Berman, Brannon Braga and Joe Menosky entertainingly offer a synaptic stimulator (a personal version of the holodeck) where Seven appears to Ransom without her Borg implants, two Doctors one whose ethical subroutines have been deleted and Chakotay and Janeway fallout. There are several character relationship arcs which give Equinox depth.With the grim tone, it's interesting to see USS Equinox stuck in the Delta Quadrant like Voyager but Ransom and crew have not responded the same way, unethically breaking the Prime Directive including mass murder.It's very satisfying film-like double episode in terms of how it looks and how the story unfolds.",
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Equinox: Part II (TV Episode 1999)",Janeway Goes Nuts,"I've thought for a long time that Kathryn Janeway's character was portrayed as unbalanced. But most of the time she comes to her senses and banks on her training and acumen. In the entire episode, she is shown to be an obsessed nut. I'd never noticed before how the more erratic she is, the more her sharp chin sticks out. It was out a lot her. The problem (and lets not forget that this is just fiction) is that her response to the Captain of the Equinox is way over the top. She throws away all those years of respect and concern for her own people to launch a vendetta against a man she had never met before. If one watches the series, we know that there are selfish scallawags all over the place. Yes, she trusted him, but she trusted Harry's judgment in the last episode. It's her judgment that shouldn't be trusted. Anyway, the final scene with Chakotay shows she has learned nothing. The crew has no choice but to follow her, but I would guess that trust not going to be easy.",7
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Equinox: Part II (TV Episode 1999)",A gripping start for the new season,"Season Six of Voyager starts where series five ended; Voyager is under attack from the nucleogenic lifeforms and the Equinox warping away with Voyager's shield generator. Captain Janeway is determined to catch the Equinox and bring her crew to justice... no matter what the cost. Looking at Captain Ransom's record she realises that he will seek somewhere to hide. She finds Equinox in orbit above a nearby planet and captures two crewmen who were seeking fuel on the surface. When she lowers the shields in the room one of the prisoners is in and threatens to let the creatures kill him if he doesn't give them information Chokotay steps in and finds himself relieved of duty. She once again crosses the line when she meets a group of aliens who enable her to talk to the nucleogenic lifeforms; she makes a deal whereby they can kill anybody on Equinox if they leave Voyager alone. As Voyager moves against the Equinox things are made difficult by the Equinox's EMH who has unbeknownst to Voyager's crew replaced the Doctor.This was a great season opener which included plenty of thrills and a sense that the Captain was going the same way as Ransom although not surprisingly by the end it looks as if she is back to her usual self. It was nice to see that Ransom got a chance to find redemption and those members of his crew who survived were integrated into Voyager's crew even if they were stripped of their rank. As with the first part John Savage put in a good performance as Capt. Ransom, believably portraying him as a man who realises the errors of his ways and seeks to find redemption.",9
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Equinox: Part II (TV Episode 1999)",Star Trek Voyager: Razor or Battlestar Galatica: Equinox,"I cannot help but notice the stark similarities between this two part actioner from season 5 finale and season six opener of Star Trek Voyager and the mini series of Battlestar Galactica: Razor.Two Captain's and their crews stranded in unknown space, trying to find their way home. One commander continues to uphold their protocol the other willing to break every rule in the name of survival.Adama/Janeway are the straight-laced captains while Cain/Ransom as the battle hardened prime directive breakers.Famed writer, show runner Ronald D. Moore was attached to both shows and I can't help wonder if this episode influenced Razor.Star Trek as a whole was an influence in the reimagining of Moore Galactica. No food or supplies at the ready with the aid of replicators. No beaming down to new planets with the gene scrambling transporters. Battlestar is hyper DiY and as grounded in physics.With all that said, anyone else see the similarities?",8

Janeway is horrified and has this crew confined to quarters. However the Equinox's evil holo doctor rescues them and they escape--leaving Voyager to deal with the wrath of the creatures Equinox has been killing!In part two, you see a wonderful change come over Captain Janeway. She becomes a bit like Captain Ahab and is determined to do just about anything to punish the Equinox crew--including abandoning them to the wrath of the creatures they've been killing. This is MEGA- cool as the Captain it too often too nice--here she is absolutely nasty--and deservedly so.

Seven doesn't know it, but the three later escaped the Collective and outside the Collective things STILL suck. This is because these three act as if they have one brain and are unable to shut out each other's thoughts. While they should have approached Seven about this directly, they instead try to kidnap her and force her to help them--but this is soon detected and they are stopped. However, Seven STILL agrees to help them and the four work together to recover their memories about why it is that they are missing memories of eight years ago AND separate. But, this has many unforeseen consequences.This is a very good episode and helps explore Seven's character more. An interesting plot as well makes this one worth your time.",8
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Survival Instinct (TV Episode 1999)",Apologies are Irrelevant,"For some reason, Ronald D Moore wrote two great Voyager episodes. This is his first offering.What makes Ron such a great Writer and Producer is his uncanny ability to completely understand all aspects of the Characters he is assigned to write for. He's got Janeway, he's got Paris, he's got Chakotay, Tuvok, Naomi Wildman and even Neelix - But he's got Seven of Sixty-Nine most of all.What we have here, is ""Attached"" times Three. Remember when Picard and Crusher were joined at the Brainstem by a paranoid alien race's gadget? Imagine if you had to live that way for a prolonged period - But not with just one other person, but with two others?Vaughn Armstrong (Lansor) and Tim Kelleher (P'Chan) are joined to Bertila Damas (Marika) in this fashion- All three share a collective of three. Because at one time, they are Borg, and so was Seven. They were all part of her original little subgroup of Borg. But wait, weren't all the other members of Seven's small collective dumped out of the Airlock in Scorpion, Part II? They were, but these original members must have escaped from The Collective before this. Let's just assume for the sake of Continuity, this is what happened- Or, perhaps, they stayed on the Cube while Seven took other Drones to Voyager. However it happened, it is just not significant.Naomi Wildman sees Seven as family. Are these three also part of Seven's family? They all share one thing in common - They are missing the exact same memories.This episode explores the processes which may occur when Drones are separated from The Collective and they each start remembering their Individual Pre-Borg Lives. All of them, including Seven, were the only survivors of the crash of a Borg Craft. They all remember what had happened while they waited to be re-assimilated, up to a point, and then it is just Blank. And even Seven had begin remembering who she was - But as she was a child when she was absorbed, she does not see this individuality as the boon the others do. And one encounter with a dying Drone Frightens her.Our collective's flashbacks reveal that P'Chan was a religious man, Marika was a Bajoran Starfleet Engineer on The Excelsior, and Lansor was a mathematician, who was Fellowshipping with other mathematicians at the time of his assimilation.These three have escaped the Collective and are trying desperately to become individuals - But this Three-Way attachment, this Collective of Three, cannot sever their link- So they were hoping Seven could help them. Why not just ask her? The Triplet considers this, they must have a consensus before they can act. So they decide to bypass Voyager's security protocols so they can connect to Seven in her Regeneration Kiosk.But this Mini-Collective had not considered Tuvok's scrutiny of the smallest glitches in the Security Net and he rapidly isolates where it is happening. And Seven herself ""Will Not Comply"".When the triad is captured and questioned, Seven decides to try to help them, she does not wish to prevent these three from becoming Individuals.What is found out is something shocking to Seven, and even more, if the connection is broken the triad cannot survive.The Doctor wishes to give them back to the Borg for Re-Assimilation - Because he values the continuation of Life. But Seven refuses, and explains to the Doctor the difference between extension of life and Quality of Life. This is one of the Rare times Seven is able to Instruct The Doctor from her Unique point of View.What this episode offers is that we care about these three former Drones- They were accosted, invaded, caused to act against what they wanted. But Apologies are Irrelevant.Only Family is relevant.",10

While Seven of Nine is settling down to have dinner with Naomi Wildman a trader approaches her and offers her some Borg parts which came from her unimatrix. After she leaves we learn that the trader was in fact a former drone, however unlike Seven he is still connected to two other drones. At first it seems their intentions towards Seven aren't good but we soon learn they just want to find a way to break the connection so they can live as individuals. As they work with Seven we get several flashbacks to their time on the planet when they lost contact with the collective and started to remember their lives before assimilation. They find that the part of their memory covering the reason they were linked to each other have been erased. When they find out the cause it is quite a shock and leaves the three of them in a coma. The treatment which could free them would mean they will only live a few more weeks, the alternative is to return them to the Collective. Seven is left to make the decision.This was a good episode which raised interesting moral dilemmas.

0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Barge of the Dead (TV Episode 1999)",Science fiction AND fantasy,"This episode is packed with Klingon religious mythology. While B'Elanna is in a near death experience, she has visions of the Klingon afterlife. She comes out changed. Tom Paris asks her ""Why have you become a born-again Klingon?"" If you are the kind of fan who hates fantasy or anything religious or mythological in your science fiction, steer clear of this episode. But, if you believe, like Chakotay says here, that, ""not everything in the universe can be scanned with a tricorder,"" you might find this episode worth a look.Without going into the storyline, it has some good dramatic tension in it. The reality of the mythic appearances is ambiguous; and at a deeper personal level, this episode is about B'Elanna coming to terms with her Klingon identity, as well as resolving—or at least making a decisive turn—on some big internal issues she has about her mother.In some ways this episode is a couple of scoops of the California Religion, but in other ways I found it interesting. While Karen Austin, as B'Elanna's mother, is given some really horrible pieces of script to deal with, we see Roxanne Dawson doing some of her best work, at least that I've ever seen. And I have to say, drawbacks aside, Ronald Moore & Co. were trying to deal with some big and serious issues here, and got a lot done in 45 minutes. I think that fans who dissed this episode by giving it low stars did so because of the Klingon religious elements; without that, I think they would have easily bulked the stars up to 8 on this one, for its acting, storyline, and even for the special effects.",8

When her shuttle is examined it emerges that the engine had ingested a piece of metal that had Klingon markings on it. The crew use this find as an excuse to throw a party celebrating Klingon culture which B'Elanna clearly isn't so keen on. Since getting back the crew aren't acting in a normal way... nothing too strange just slightly out of character. Things turn strange when the party is interrupted by Klingon warriors who proceed to kill everybody present. B'Elanna then finds herself aboard the Barge of the Dead, the ship which according to Klingon belief takes the dead to Gre'Thor where those who died in dishonour are doomed to spend eternity. While on the barge her mother appears then suddenly B'Elanna finds herself in Voyager's sickbay; apparently everything we'd seen up to that point was part of a near death experience. She refuses to accept that is was just imagined and is determined that she must save her mother who has been condemned because of B'Elanna's lack or interest in her Klingon heritage. In order to do this she must be taken to the point of death so she can return to the barge and offer to take her mother's place... When she gets there it is not what she expected the Klingon Hell to be like.This wasn't a bad episode and Roxann Dawson put in a good performance as B'Elanna. The scenes on the barge didn't really feel like they were aboard a ship at see although that may have been a deliberate move to show that this was in the slightly surreal world of the dead rather than in the normal universe.",7
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Barge of the Dead (TV Episode 1999)",Most surely my favorite episode of Voyager,"So this is most surely my favorite episode of Voyager, for several reasons.One, much like a lot of Voyager and late DS9, it's just trippy as hell, and I'm a big fan of trippy Star Trek.Which ended somewhere around the last disastrous episode of Voyager or when Enterprise jumped the shark by not only going back in time to fight the Nazis but by copying a virtually identical double episode of Voyager. What the f were they on then? The world may never know but it can't be good and TV Trek never truly recovered.Two is that this entire episode is clearly an allusion to Dante's journey through ""The Inferno"" circa the thirteenth century. Surely any modern art form that manages to faithfully pay tribute to another published 700 years previous is worthy of preservation in the Library of Congress.Unfortunately this would surely be lost on 95% of TV audiences when the episode aired in 1999 and 99% as of 2018. So this episode is at the same time a commentary on humanity's past, present, and future, by analogy to B'Elanna's Klingon past, present, and future, though clearly lost on most viewers so the producers really snuck one by Paramount's executive and test audience teams and for that I commend them.Few things in Trek OR film or TV history ever came close to this feat of production, and for that, I shall petition the LOC to include this episode in its collection of culturally significant American works of art.To MartinHafer I disagree 100%. Many people with spiritual traditions either derived from or similar to Native American spiritual traditions hold exactly the same beliefs, that one can both have a spiritual experience and accept that it did not occur within our familiar (at least) four dimensional physical or mathematical realm that we know as ""reality.""To many people, including myself though I am not of Native American heritage, what people recognise as ""reality"" is subjective, and this episode at least seems to me to explore the boundaries between objective and subjective reality to an extent only ever performed on U.S. network TV perhaps in TNG's ""The Inner Light"" or DS9's ""Extreme Measures"" the latter of which coincidentally or maybe not aired in 1999 as well. Too bad it was all downhill from there as far as ""Trek"", Science fiction, and Television in general are all concerned.""Wars"" never came close in at least 41 years. Good luck DIS.

It has a rather lengthy period on Voyager first where all the Federation members start going Klingon-crazy after they find a Klingon artifact in space. However, later you learn that it's all a hallucination! What follows is also likely a hallucination...or is it?! Suddenly Torres finds herself on a barge bound for Klingon hell!! However, after a while, she is brought out of this when she is revived by the Doctor--but just as this is happening, she sees her mom drop onto the barge as well. Does this mean mommy is also dead? To find out and if she can help, Torres asks the Doc to kill her...and then bring her back after she's had a chance of a family reunion.This is all very mystical and stupid. But what bothered me more is that it was so inconsistent. Mr. Chakotay is practically the poster child for wacky spirituality with his spirit guides, talking with dead grandpa and the like. And when Torres tries to talk to her about this, he mostly blows her off and pretty much says there's no afterlife! Huh?! Why didn't Robert Beltran at least say ""This ain't consistent""...because it wasn't. So what we have is a silly episode that doesn't make a lot of sense.

Also, when Miral talks to B'Elanna in the final sequences of Barge of the Dead, she says they will see each other in Sto-Vo-Kor or when she gets home, but when B'Elanna returns home, her father is talking a bit depressed, so it may be that Miral is dead.",8
6,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Barge of the Dead (TV Episode 1999)",B'Elanna the Forgettable,"I feel like we've seen several iterations of this rather unspectacular idea in Voyager: a spirit quest. Janeway has done it with some, what were they, afterlife aliens who devoured souls or whatnot, Chakotay and his spirit guides, etc.There is a good point in doing it once again though: Clearly, Klingon mythology is much more interesting than fake native american rituals or random one-off aliens. But this is where the episode misses the mark. Instead of dealing with Klingon hell and culture, it spends most of its time with B'Elanna being confused and trying to resolve issues with her mother - what's worse, the viewer is left mystified as to how they were resolved. In short, B'Elanna agrees to take her mother's place in Gre'thor, and then doesn't. And it's not that she achieves some kind of enlightenment or solves the riddle of Kahless, she pretty much declares ""I don't understand what you want from me"" and wakes up. Suuuure. You are shown the Klingon version of Charon, who also is the first Klingon, who killed the Gods (one of the cleverest bits of Star Trek lore)...and that's it. No insight. Just a guy. You have a Klingon NPC who first informs B'Elanna where she is - even he could easily become a memorable character, as a dishonored Klingon. He just never says anything again. And Gre'thor? A place of fire. Really? Come on.I don't care how random or unjustified B'Elanna's near death experience is, I don't care how unconvincing her total conviction in it is, I don't care that Chakotay, medicine man of the seven galaxies, suddenly distrusts visions. I'd forgive all of this in a heartbeat if they came up with some kind of redeeming heroic quest for B'Elanna and some insight into the guest characters. But this was done lazily.",6

His daydreams are hilarious and involve him being more like a super-hero than just a holo doctor. He repeatedly saves the day and in one case he destroys a Borg cube single- handedly and becomes a major chick-magnet!! In another, he sings a lovely aria with hilarious lyrics as he takes out a crazed Tuvok who is experiencing Pom Far. He also is a great painter in another and is trying his hand at painting a naked Seven of Nine! What's even funnier is that an alien race is secretly watching Voyager and they can see the Doctor's fantasies and believe they are real!! So, when they attack the Federation, they know they'll have their hands full with this holo doctor!!

2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Tinker Tenor Doctor Spy (TV Episode 1999)",I love this episode,"Star trek TNG and Voyager were my two favorite shows of the ST universe. And every once in a while I go on binges where I watch favorite episodes of both and this by far is one of my favorite Voyager episodes.Mainly because it just exploits things that aren't the status quo such that we get to see the actors so out of normal character, that and I love it when they bring comedy into such a serious show as this, and repeatedly throughout the episode. Robert totally stole the show, as he should considering this episode was all about him anyway. But what's great is it really lets him shine as he is such a fine and versatile actor, plus you get to see and hear him sing, yes that's his voice...Outside of the obvious comedic situations is the more subtle looks & gestures from the rest of the crew during such situations, in way too many scenes to mention, which makes an already hilarious episode even more over the top. I can only imagine how fun this episode much have been to film.ST universe is normally a pretty serious universe with humor spliced in here and there, which is what makes this episode so special, that and we get to see a wider range of acting from our family of actors in this show. Makes me laugh again and again every time I see this episode. 10/10!",10
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Tinker Tenor Doctor Spy (TV Episode 1999)",A Whole Race of Aliens who look like Googy Gress!,"I don't think these guys have ever been identified by name, other than ""The Hierarchy"". But every single member of this race looks like Googy Gress! So I suppose we can call them ""The Googys"". They appear to be a race of busybodies, spies and Peeping Toms.They also look a bit like an Illustration I saw by Rick Sternbach for a Book by Larry Niven regarding a bar on the Moon called ""The Draco Tavern"" - One of the Sternbach covers for that book showed a couple of Aliens drinking in a bar and I am positive one of them looked just like these guys - But I am not surprised, as Rick Sternbach has been one of Trek's Main Illustrators for decades, and has worked with Mike Okuda on at least 3 Trek Shows.So these guys and this episode have a special place in my affection of Trek, just knowing that most of the Ships in Trek were designed by Sternbach, I can look at any number of Del Rey Science Fiction books from the 70's and 80's and I see space ships that he drew used in Trek Episodes. So when I saw the Hierarchy Ships this call came back to me.The Doctor has created a subroutine that allows him to daydream. He is doing so as this episode starts, he is singing about the plight of Vulcan Pon Farr to the tune of ""Le Donna e Mobile"". Robert Picardo has an excellent singing voice, and this is probably the first time he gets to sing almost a full verse of Opera and not ""I've been Workin' On the Railroad"".But from this point the episode just keeps getting funnier, especially when they plug The Doc into the Holodeck and get to see exactly what he has been fantasizing about.Embarrassing to say the least, nobody would like to have their daydreams dissected the way The Docs are here. But I think Trek has hit upon something important that we all share, a healthy ability to Daydream, Woolgather and Fantasize.One member of The Hierarchy, ""Devro"" (Robert Greenberg) has figured out a way to tap in to The Doc's perceptual subroutines, but he is seeing only the Docs Daydreams, Devro thinks what he sees is real, so he becomes rather alarmed when he sees ""The Emergency Command Hologram"" Blast a Borg Cube into Microscopic Kibbles, Bits and Chunks with a ""Photonic Cannon"".But Devro's Peeping Tom gimmick has actually fouled up The Docs ability to sort out his own daydreams from reality, and Doc starts seeing all kinds of crazy stuff, and he can't control it or shut it off. B'Elanna has to turn him off and fix him.Unfortunately, The Hierarchy has approved a Level Three attack on Voyager. This is how The Hierarchy operates, each member has to submit a proposal to their leaders to be approved (or not).So Devro has to pull the wool over his own Overlooker, played by Googy. I wish they had used Googy for the Devro role, but he's great as The Overlooker. He does so with the help of The Doc.As Harry says, ""This is the part I like"" - When The Doc takes on the ECH guise, four Captain's Dots appear on his new red uniform.With Janeway's Permission, Doc becomes The Emergency Command Hologram for the first time and dodges a Level Four attack using a Bluff.The Hierarchy shows up twice more in Voyager, one time In ""The Void"" and one more time when the Doc becomes a ""Renaissance Man"". Each time they appear they look like Googy, even though Googy only played an Overlooker this one time. An honor, a signal honor to have a Trek Alien even partially designed using one's features.Too Bad they were only used in Three Episodes, they had a lot of potential.

As the daydreams continue they start to manifest themselves when he is on duty and soon he can't separate reality and fantasy. Based on what they have seen the aliens plan to attack Voyager and by the time the one responsible for hacking into the Doctor's dreams realises his mistake it is too late for him to tell his superiors without risking his job. After he has supposedly been fixed he has another dream, this time the alien who hacked him appears in it and tells him of the attack offering to help the Doctor prevent the attack in exchange for the doctor playing captain so that his superiors don't find out his information was erroneous.This episode was rather fun, it was interesting to see what the Doctor dreamt about, he is more human than one would expect of a hologram, the fantasied about being desired by female crew members, being highly respected and being given the opportunity to become the emergency Command Hologram... he even has a dirty mind; dreaming of painting a nude Seven of Nine.",8

It is never mentioned, no one ever comments on how ludicrous and illogical this is. And considering the ship was also haunting the trader, wouldn't he have been far more adept at finding parts for the ship and repairing it?If all the ship wanted to do was kill itself in a spacial phenomenon then why was Tom Paris so necessary? And if it was why didn't the ship make the trader take it to the 'particle fountain' long beforehand?.More to the point: the ship was capable of trapping B'Leanna Torres inside itself and attempted to kill her. The ship could do this on its own but it couldn't fly itself into a spacial phenomena? It needed to sacrifice a pilot for no good reason? Just illogical! I do like this episode, but the ships sole intent to destroy itself, with no explanation of why, was a very weak plot device in my opinion.",6

The effect takes the form of a beautiful woman who only he can see, she constantly urges him to get the parts needed to repair her even though this means taking parts from Voyager. When B'Elanna boards her and tries to access her systems Alice tries to kill her, Tom saves her but won't believe his ship tried to kill her, instead believing she must have touched the wrong button.

Once in space she integrates him into her systems and heads off towards a particle fountain, an anomaly which would destroy any ship getting too close. With the Doctor's help B'Elanna must access the interface between Tom and Alice so he can be saved.This episode was fairly enjoyable and Claire Rankin was good in the role of the personification of Alice and Robert Duncan McNeill did a fine job as Tom Paris as his personality changed due to Alice's influence.

However, if Tuvok is restored, what will become of his affection for Neelix?This is an incredibly satisfying episode.

Neelix begins feeling strong guilt about the situation about what he could have done differently and what he can now do to help Tuvok. When he speaks to the Doctor about this, the Doctor tells him of rare instances when external stimuli have triggered a reaction in the comatose patient. Neelix sets to this task with relish and starts bringing and doing things with Tuvok constantly to try and elicit a response. When Neelix does get a response from him after the Doctor becomes slightly irritated about one of his attempts, the result is more than either could have expected. Tuvok is suddenly awake and alert. However he is not his old self at all. Instead he experiences an almost child like simplistic view of the world. After a harrowing incident Tuvok is able to speak again, but still with this same more emotional and simple view of the world. Eventually he is restored to his former self but there does still seem to be some of the ""emotional Tuvok"" left.

Upon being awakened these people, known as the Vaadwaur, claim that they are the true owners of the corridors which they used for trade and that the Turei amongst others attacked them so they could gain control. Neelix remembers that the Vaadwaur were mentioned in ancient Talaxian legends and when he looks at those legends he learns they were a race that were feared, these legends also match information Seven finds in the Borg database. It soon becomes clear that Captain Janeway will have to decide which of the two aliens represent the greater threat if she is to get away from the planet.While this isn't the first Star Trek episode where the apparently friendly aliens turn out to be a greater threat than those that seem hostile it was done well; I wasn't sure whether the Vaadwaur were good or bad before they were exposed.

So it would seem that the initial ugly-aliens Voyager encounters were not really their enemy. Seven confirms Neelix's supposition by comparing his stories to what Borg History she knows.So Voyager's ""New"" best dressed for success allies spout Dragon's Teeth and attack, Janeway was able to get power back by inhaling the radioactive planet's atmosphere using the Bussard Collectors, while giving the original Ugly Aliens access to the Well-Dresser's secret Satellite.So once again, Voyager is able to escape by the skin of their teeth, all because Seven opened a refrigerator.Some of these Well Dressed Aliens escape into the tunnels, apparently to come back later to bite Voyager on the Arse, fortunately that never happened.

0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" One Small Step (TV Episode 1999)",A moving tribute towards space exploration!,"This episode isn't perfect. Mainly because Chakotay's attitude here seems somewhat out of character. Despite these flaws, the episode is chock-full of interesting and relevant themes worth exploring.Space exploration has always been a kind of a spiritual journey in my opinion. One of humanity noblest endeavors. And this episode pays tribute to that! I always loved Star Trek's attitude towards space exploration: it's not something irrelevant that just throws away money and resources, as many would have you believe in our contemporary world. It's the outward expansion of the human spirit. An expansion towards the Universe. Reaching out, discovering and redefining ourselves along the way. Even if it means to face failure. Because failure and success are just two sides of the same coin. You can't appreciate success if you haven't failed. And as the Mars pilot Lt. John Kelly says in his own words in the episode 'Don't see it as a failure..I don't'.I really liked that Seven, understands all this in the end of the episode, when she says that 'In a sense, we're more alike than one might think. In a sense, his desire to explore was not unlike a quest for perfection. His contributions helped secure humanity's future...and my own'.These are really very deep themes worthy of appreciation and reflection upon. And are very relevant also today, in a world fixated on being as risk-averse as possible, and dismissive of the value of exploration and discovery. And it has always been such a pleasure that these themes are integral to the Star Trek philosophy as well and this episode chooses to pay such a tribute to this.",9

She has no concept of the risk taken and what baby steps were hurdled as humans reached out to the stars. The Borg don't explore, they assimilate. Humans at this level of technology wouldn't have even interested them so the effort here doesn't register to her. As Seven listens to LT Kelley's tapes we see her gradually change her attitude. Normally a mission focused unemotional unit in a collective with no concept of risk, Seven begins to understand the concept of what it meant to be a true explorer and hero. She comes to appreciate sacrifice and selfless dedication exhibited by Kelley as he states his mission isn't a failure and continues to explore with the clear realization the fruits of his labor would never be seen as his life was going to end trapped in a little metal box with no windows. She comes to realize that Kelley was an individual that chose to take this risk for the betterment of humanity. He's not just a drone assigned a task in which he has no choice but to comply.Seven's comment to Kelley ""The Yankees, in six games"" during his memorial service is the culmination of this growth. Another baby step in her quest to become human again and understand humanity.Wonderful episode.",9

Anyone who has been in the service will know that the burial at the end is a high honor. The speech shows that seven is growing as an individual and connected with someone else.

However, when the ellipse appears once again, Chakotay might just get himself and others killed.This is a bittersweet and enjoyable type of episode with a lot of sad nostalgia associated with it.

Also, ""Requiem for a Methuselah"", ""Day of the Dove"" and my Favourite, ""By Any Other Name"". In fact Deep Space Nine's 7th Season 12th Episode ""The Emperor's New Cloak"" was also dedicated to him.He also wrote Gigaquads of Short Stories in the 50's and 60's, one of these was called ""The Holes Around Mars"" - Regarding an Anomaly orbiting Mars, one of the first times a conundrum was used in a science fiction story.This 24th Century Conundrum has also orbited mars in the 21st Century, and taken away an Orbiting Command Module The Aries 4 containing a Lt. John Kelly (Mission Impossible Alumni Greg Morris' Progeny, Phil Morris- Quite a resemblance), whose dedication saw him continuing to take readings on the oddity until he was sucked into it.This Graviton Ellipse, or Borg Spacial Anomaly 521, is following Voyager like an Excited Puppy, the Object likes to follow things (and ships) exhibiting Electromagnetic Energy. Voyager's On-Line History Books show Kelly's Command Module getting inhaled by this thing.So of course, they want to go in there and pick up relics. Seven knows a Borg way of doing this, and Joins the two Mars aficionados of Voyager, Chakotay and Paris in the Modified Flyer.They find plenty when they get inside, it has junk that has been accumulating since the Big Bang floating around in it. But Chakotay wants the Big Prize, the ""Aries 4"" command Module.But the Anomaly suddenly finds something it likes more than Voyager - A Dark Matter Asteroid. Janeway tells Chakotay to get the hell out of there but he disobeys, trying to tractor the Module but they run out of time and when the Asteroid Hits, they get sucked back in.I've read quite a discussion of this in these reviews, that Chakotay was a jerk, incompetent, but most great discoveries were also the result of ""Extreme Risk"" taking. Perhaps Chakotay was a bit too ambitious or maybe even greedy. But in all fairness, any one of us may have done exactly what he did.But Seven of Sixty-Nine does not agree, she is very angry that Chakotay had put them all at risk. But she forgets that at the beginning of the Episode, she was also disobeying Orders, trying to enhance the Ships Computer without Torres' Authorization and it caused a multitude of problems. So the damage is done, with 2 hours before the Ellipse gets snorted back into Subspace, they have to figure out a way to get power to their Propulsion systems.When Voyager sends a Probe in to the Ellipse and regains Comms, Torres shows them a 21st century solution to their problem, use a gadget that's on the Command Module that can do the same thing as a Plasma Manifold.With Paris trying to regain the Flyer's Systems and Chakotay injured, Seven puts on an EV suit and beams to the Module. While there, she starts recording Kelly's Logs. Even while facing death, he kept taking readings and doing his job. She finds this admirable.In the end she is able to save the logs, as well as the Plasma Carburetor and Kelly's body. They are able to exit the Ellipse with mere seconds (as usual, eh?)Regardless of these ""Cookie Cutter"" story elements, I enjoyed Seven's time on the Module and the short Vignettes of Kelly's last logs. A change in her occurs, she is able to understand why Humans will go to such extreme measures in the name of Exploration.Our own space program was fraught with accidents and unfortunate occurrences, but we keep trying even in the face of these and even Government Shutdowns. We should have stations on the Moon by how, but all we have is one measly International Space Station and a Hubble Telescope or two. Perhaps one day we will send Men to Mars, even if there is not as much as a Microbe there.

I thought the speech at the funeral was very out-of-character. And Seven brings the body back all for them to bury him in space. I think Kelly would've rather stayed with his ship, his dream. This episode just was all wrong from the start. It's like they had this great back story, great character (Phil Morris was great and so were his scenes) and they hurried to come up with a reason to go into the ellipse. Just leaves me chapped.

Seven thinks this is an unnecessary risk but Captain Janeway encourages her to ""volunteer"" for the mission. Once inside they find the module and try to tow it out using the tractor beam, unfortunately the anomaly is approaching a large dark matter object so they are ordered to get out of quickly. Chakotay refuses to leave the module behind and they are caught in the anomaly without engines with only a couple of hours to find a way to get out before the anomaly returns to subspace.This episode had a decent story although it seemed that Chakotay was acting out of character when he refused to leave the module and thus endangered the crew of the Flyer.

Her theories then start to get more and more paranoid; she tells Chakotay that she believes the Captain is on a secret mission to set up a Star Fleet presence in the quadrant, then she tells the captain that Chakotay is part of a Maquis plot to use the catapult to attack Star Fleet, she even challenges young Naomi Wildman as to which side she is allied with.This was a decent episode where Seven learnt that she can't do all the things she could when she was a drone.

So Seven runs the specs of the Space-Catapult into her brain while she regenerates, and therein is where all the fun, and paranoia begins.Her Sleep-Scan reveals that the Catapult ironically uses a power source similar to or maybe even the same as one on The Caretaker's array, The Caretaker who had Sucked Voyager into the Delta Quadrant, and reveals that our Alien of the Week in fact was keeping this information secret from Voyager. He gives a good reason, but Seven is on a roll. She views the old logs from the destruction of the Caretaker's Array and finds what appears to be a tractor beam from a cloaked ship. Then she finds a Cardassian Ship that had been sucked over (one with a cloak apparently, maybe one of the ones from the Orias Shipyards made by The Obsidian Order- But we can dismiss this, the Obsidian-Order ships were only used to invade the Founder's planet in DS9).From then on, the ""evidence"" keeps piling up, and one conspiracy after another is submitted to both Janeway and Chakotay, who are now wearing Phasers in each other's presence!The end effect is that new seeds of distrust have been sowed into the Voyager crew. This is the ultimate effect of ALL Conspiracy Theories - None of these things Seven finds can be proved, as it was all circumstantial evidence. But the effect can be immediately seen in the instant effect it has on the command structure of the ship.This is why I suspect all conspiracy theories, truth be DAMNED. They can only cause existing problems to become worse, and cause new problems where none existed before. A little Rumour? A Little Innuendo? You think proving a stupid point is gonna change anything? It's not.In the case of Seven, she had already dropped all interest in the original conspiracies she found, she keeps finding new ones- Because her Implant was broken.That was her excuse. We, as people have none.What happens in this episode, has happened recently in Politics in the US: And where the original ""Conspiracies"" fell flat (because they were all made up in the first place), they kept finding all kinds of new ones. See, this is how it works: You suspect someone of something, you try to prove it. Then you are proved wrong. You don't make up a new Conspiracy to take the place of original one you made up. If you do, pretty soon nobody believes anything you say anymore, even if you finally manage to find a real conspiracy (Which will never happen - Finding a real conspiracy I mean).If you consider all of the ""Evidence"" Seven gives to Janeway and Chakotay, which seems to be fact after fact after disconnected, unrelated fact delivered in rapid succession, it is all inconclusive, derivative. Some of these facts are interesting but not one thing Seven spits out can be proved to have any relation to any of the other things. In fact, they don't - And they don't have to be explained, they are, basically not worth explaining.Thankfully, Janeway and Chakotay come to realize this almost instantly, if only real people in the real world can see: You can't prove it, so just drop it. The other thing we can take away from this episode, is don't mess with anything that can affect your mind or your perception of reality- Like believing conspiracies exist in the first place.",10
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Voyager Conspiracy (TV Episode 1999)",This episode makes no sense at all....and they should have been ashamed of themselves for making it.,"I think ""The Voyager Conspiracy"" is one of the worst episodes of ""Star Trek: Voyager"". It just doesn't make a lot of sense but more than that, the characters simply react in ways that violate everything you've seen over the last five seasons. To me, this is very bad writing and would be akin to having Dorothy from ""The Wizard of Oz"" turning tricks or ""Superman"" joining the Nazis!! Because of this incredible inconsistency, the folks who made this SHOULD have been awfully embarrassed.Voyager finds some galactic weirdo who is working on some sort of catapult system in order to fly HUGE distances very quickly. While they are assisting, Seven of Nine begins putting 2 and 2 together and coming up with 147! She suddenly creates a bunch of insane theories and tells Chakotay that the Captain is working for an evil Federation/Cardassian alliance! Only moments later, however, she's telling the Captain that Chakotay and the Maquis are plotting and tells roughly the same story--but with the Maquis working with the Cardassians! None of these stories make any sense whatsoever and it's obvious that she is experiencing some paranoid delusions.The delusions isn't the problem with this one. After all, SOMETHING making Seven paranoid is an interesting story idea. What IS the problem is that any of her nutty ramblings pick up traction! How could Chakotay doubt Janeway or vice-versa?! Why not laugh off Seven's theories and confront her about them?! NOT doing this make this an absolutely crazy and stupid episode. Overall, this is a very frustrating episode because the writer didn't respect his characters or the audience. A HUGE disappointment and a show that actually irritated me!",3
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Voyager Conspiracy (TV Episode 1999)",Seven on a String,"Seven is so machine -like, so why would her erratic behavior be something totally unusual. Granted, her information is amazing, but she begins to notice things, but her zealousness makes behooves them to check the facts. It takes the total change of trust between Chakotay and Janeway to give an credence to her findings. She is constantly downloading stuff into her personal database--why couldn't she be off base.",6

After downloading a huge quantity of data into her implants, she begins concocting outlandish, contradictory conspiracy theories using the same data set. It's like mind-mapping while on drugs. The result of this is to make Janeway and Chakotay suspicious of each other. She even verbally attacks the little Wildman girl. One odd thing at the end is that Voyager seems to abandon the Delta Flyer in space! I rate this episode not for the story but for the quality Jeri Ryan time.",8
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Pathfinder (TV Episode 1999)","Howlin Mad ""Broccoli""","Reginald Barclay (Dwight Schulz) was a groundbreaking character in Star Trek: The Next Generation- Simply by being Neurotic. It showed us that People in the 24th Century can be as interesting as people in the 20th and 21st Centuries. It is Broccoli's multiplex infirmities that brought Next Generation to level Human Ground, in that he was probably the most realistic Human Character of that whole show- and his insecurities mix with his imagination to reveal a complex person. And in true ""Broccoli"" Style, Schulz slams a home run in this Voyager Episode. But there can be no Barclay episode without Counsellor Troi, and her ability to set Barclay back on his feet.This is Broccoli at his best, his eccentricities are what made him the best Diagnostician on the Enterprise D, and that same eccentricity serves him here, in his new Job.The last we saw him, he had Helped Dr. Zimmerman develop the Emergency Medical Hologram. I am assuming he did that ""job"" after the Enterprise D was blown to Smithereens and before he was assigned to the Enterprise E for ""First Contact"" (Confusing, Innit?). But he is now one of a Team working on a project called ""Pathfinder""- Which is as team of Starfleet engineers trying to Track Voyager's Movements through the Delta Quadrant.But Reginald is not your typical Engineer, and he has developed a new unhealthy attachment to Holographic Representation of Voyager's Crew. What I like about Barclay's Holo-Voyager are the differences to the Real Voyager- For example, Maquis Crewmen are still wearing Civvies, not Starfleet Uniforms. This is to show that although Voyager has been able to send a few messages through, Starfleet really does not know that much about Voyager's Delta Quadrant History, or it's current Command Structure. It is Barclay's Neurosis that cause him to think of a way they can successfully set up a 2-way dialog with Voyager.Reginald's Boss - Although not really being a Bean Counter or Pencil Pusher, is not as receptive as Geordi LaForge was to Barclay's ideas. He is just, well, ""Normal"", but more importantly, he is not used to Barclay's non-sequitor approach to solving problems. So he suppresses Barclay, which sends Barclay into more of a depressive and anxious state. How someone can be Depressed, Anxious AND hypertensive is a new mix for the Medical Journals. So Reginald's Boss, not knowing Reg, exacerbates the situation by no fault of his own - He just hasn't learned how Reg operates, and in his attempts at forcing Reg into his Jell-O Mold of Normalcy, pushes Reg fully into new ""Hollow Pursuits"".But one thing we know about Reg is that he won't give up. In a way, Voyager's crew helps him solve his current conundrum, it's just that they are Holograms. But one thing Reg is good at is designing Holo Programs- He has created a fully interactive Voyager Crew which acts in fairly close approximation to how they would act - Despite the fact that Barclay is everyone's ""buddy"". But this is just how the Holos are designed to act.After creating a nice sinkhole for himself, Reginald has a Tete-a-Tete with Deanna Troi, who takes leave from the Enterprise E to stay and help him.True to Form, this does Reg little good - He breaks Starfleet Protocol and performs his experiment without permission, resulting in a new Hollow ""Pursuit"" as Starfleet Security Pursues him through the Holographic Decks of Voyager. But he uses these stolen moments to aim his ""Micro Wormhole"" to the right spot where Voyager will detect his Transmission- Because Starfleet was not looking for Voyager in the right area, Barclay finds the right spot at the last minute.We finally get to meet ""Admiral Owen Paris"" (Richard Herd) - Tom's father.This episode had me cringing, face palming, and sweating as Barclay's situation just kept getting worse and worse, and the resolution of this episode in contrast to this, gave me a large measure of Hope. I don't know why it would affect me like that, after all, isn't Voyager in itself a form of Holodeck fantasy? It is for that reason I was uplifted. This episode deals with exactly that - How a fantasy can bridge the gap to reality and grant real hope to a person- This happens to the characters we care about in this episode, and it happens to us as it was Broadcast from the TV to our Eyes and Ears.And all it took was a Neurotic Character acting Neurotically. Dwight really outdid ""Howlin Mad"" Barclay here, this was one of his best performances as that character.",10
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Pathfinder (TV Episode 1999)",Voyager hasn't been forgotten by Star Fleet,"Unusually this episode is not predominantly set on Voyager or indeed the Delta Quadrant; it is set back on Earth where Lt. Reg Barclay is talking to Counsellor Troi about how has been relieved of his position in the Pathfinder Project, This is a research project aimed at contacting Voyager. In a series of flash backs we see how Reg has been using a holographic version of Voyager where he interacts with the crew, sometimes concerning work but frequently using them as surrogate friends who all think he is a great guy rather than the shy and bumbling character he is in the real world. While he might be bumbling he has an idea which he believes will allow a brief two way conversation with Voyager, unfortunately he has a record of unsuccessful ideas and is suspended after going over his commanders head to tell Admiral Paris of his ideas. Despite being taken off the project he breaks into the lab and tries to make contact with Voyager. When caught he retreats into the holosuite Voyager trying to buy time until the real Voyager can reply to his message.This was a decent episode with Dwight Schultz doing well as the bumbling Barclay. The things that stood out for me were the little details; for example his holographic version Voyager the details aren't quite right; he has the former Maquis crew wearing Maquis rather than Star Fleet uniforms. It was also nice to see Marina Sirtis reprising her ""Next Generation"" role as Counsellor Troi.",7
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Pathfinder (TV Episode 1999)",A few years have passed and Barkley is still a creepy kinda guy!,"Back when he was a semi-regular on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", Lt. Barkley was a creepy guy who was filled with doubts and spent all his free time in a holo suite living out a life of confidence, sexual appeal and competence. Outside it, he was a schmuck who stuttered a lot and avoided relationships. Normal, he wasn't. Now with this episode of ""Star Trek: Voyager"", he's pretty much the same pathetic and creepy guy. However, instead of having his way with the women of Enterprise, he sees himself as a stud living on Voyager. If you think about it, this is even sicker and creepier, as he's never even been on Voyager nor has he met these folks!Part of Barkley's fascination with Voyager is his insistence that he can somehow reach out to the ship and contact them...and perhaps one day help bring them back to Earth. No one believes him, as they just see him as a creepy guy to be avoided. Can Barkley rise to the occasion and help Voyager even though he's a bazillion light-years away from the Delta Quadrant?I am not a huge fan of the Barkley character. Had he evolved and become more competent and less a skeezy guy who annoys holo women, I would have enjoyed this one a lot more. Still, it was moderately interesting.",6
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Pathfinder (TV Episode 1999)",He Makes Me Nervous,"Barkley is a connection to TNG and is pretty much the same sad figure he always was. But he has technical competence and he knows how to get communications with Voyager. He is such a weird figure with some really dicey sexuality issues, and so when we see him sidling up to his holographic women, it gives one the creeps. I don't enjoy having characters from past series show up in newer series. I have to say it was sort of boring with a ""hopeful"" but predictable ending.",6
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Fair Haven (TV Episode 2000)",Something Different,"What a great episode. I know, some of the other reviews are upset about the stereotyping of Ireland, but they have completely missed the point! This is about the Captain and her solitude. It is also in the future and a made up holoprogram. The Doctor says, she can't have a relationship with anyone so it may as well been a hologram. Plus, it hints that the crew, and the Captain use the holodeck for ""special"" needs. It is nice to see that they centered the episode around a woman and her needs. According to Voyager, they have been in space, what? 5 years. 5 years!? That is a long time. I thought it was a sweet episode and something different. I love space and sci-fi, but it is nice to see an episode about the characters. Especially such an intimate look at Captain Janeway.",10
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Fair Haven (TV Episode 2000)",Irish heritage and the loneliness of command explored.,"I just read all five of the existing reviews. The British reviews were cynical and caustic. I didn't care for the negative attitude. It is obvious that the accents were off. I agree that the depiction of Ireland is not realistic. Apparently, the human resources in Hollywood are limited in this regard. The series has a whirlwind schedule and what can you expect? Miracles? I do believe that the production crew did the best they could to give the audience a hint of Ireland, and wouldn't this be the most likely creation on the holodeck given the background of the characters who created the program (Tom Paris and Harry Kim)? Recreating Ireland accurately is really missing the point anyway, the point of the story is to place Janeway in an idyllic Irish setting and explore the characters Irish heritage and the loneliness of command. The Twilight Zone series explored loneliness in several of its finest episodes. I believe this episode of Voyager handled both aspects of the story pretty well. Although some of the humor was predictable, sometimes that's what makes it funny. The scene with Seven was delightful and the doctors humor was very well written, as usual. I also loved the scenes with Janeway and Micheal Sullivan. This episode moved me; I loved it. I loved the Irish setting and especially the Irish music. Bravo!",
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Fair Haven (TV Episode 2000)",A fun episode,"I had trouble watching the series. It just didn't hold me like past series. I recently caught this episode on BBC. It was fun. I liked the small Irish town of Fair Haven. I'd want to visit there. The episode was well cast. I personally like the holodeck episodes, on any of the series.",10
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Fair Haven (TV Episode 2000)",Top of The Nebula To You !,Watched this episode last night and really enjoyed it.The majority of the episode is based in the virtual town of 'Fair Haven ' where we see the loneliness of Captain Jaynewaye finding solace in a holographic bartender.All the actors look to be really enjoying there ' r + r ' from space and the stand out scenes are Tom and Harry envisioning there perfect coastal scene and a somewhat seasick Tuvok struggling to keep his lunch intact.Although my fav is a small scene stealing clip of Seven frequenting the local alehouse.,9
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Fair Haven (TV Episode 2000)",Damn good episode!,"What a blast! The writers of the Voyager series consistently outdo themselves but this episode is above and beyond even for them. Tom Paris constructs a wonderful holo deck simulation reminiscent of 19th century southern Ireland, and it catches on with the entire crew, even Janeway falls for it's allure. The accents are a bit off in the simulation, but there are several wonderful performances by the ship's crew in the program. One particularly entertaining scene involves Seven getting hit on in an Irish pub after beating one of the locals at ""rings"". I don't wish to spoil too much of the show, but give it a watch!Best episode I have seen so far with the exception of Pathfinder.",10
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Fair Haven (TV Episode 2000)",And did Those Feet in Ancient times...,"Walk upon england's mountains green? And was the holy Lamb of God, On England's pleasant pastures seen?...NOPE!The number one rule of Hollywood is, they NEVER get details right, especially in TV shows. Also, Southern California Ain't Ireland or England. It wasn't in National Velvet and it wasn't in this Episode. The problem with certain people groups is that they want depictions of their fine green and pleasant land to be exactly realistic. Sorry, nope: It ain't all about YOU. Besides, it's a Holo-Novel. And it ain't gonna be realistic even if filmed IN that locale. I thought this show was about Voyager and her crew and how they cope with Borg on one side and unknown aliens on the other. So, every single negative review of this episode is invalid. What is this, Lassie come Home?I loved these Fairhaven Episodes, obviously they can't catch the exact look of the area, besides, it was an area that never existed even in the real Ireland. And Paris made it up, and he's as American as Apple Pie so if ya wanna blame someone, blame Tom Paris, it's always his fault anyway.This episode and it's sequel ""Spirit Folk"" are nice diversions from the grim storyline being told on either side of it. And it shows that Janeway is human after all.When I was watching the series while it was being broadcast I was hoping for more of these little escapades in Fairhaven. They collected quite a good array of character actors for the town people to populate the place, and they used them in 2 episodes. That was a feat. You see what makes these two Eps great are these town people. Who cares if their dialect is not right?Dialects and accents in UK change from one town to the other, so no TV show has never gotten that right, ever. Movies? Sometimes they got it right. It's just the basic idea. You see, I don't care how they depict the USA in UK media, they always get US wrong too. The funniest thing to watch are the War-Movies of the 1940's made in UK, when they show 'American"" characters, they flub it up beautifully. And it seems that the negative reviews all share that same tired complaint, ""It ain't like Ireland"" - So what and Who Cares.It was this idea, that they were to run the town 24/7 so it was there all the time. When ya do that in any Holo Novel, of course the people will start developing into something other than Holodeck Characters. And Janeway had been Celibate for 6 years, so it was about time.",10
6,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Fair Haven (TV Episode 2000)",One of the best episodes,"The Fair Haven holodeck program is just what a holodeck should be - wish fulfilment. Stuck in the Delta Quadrant with access to holodeck technology it's a wonder the crew don't spend even more time exploring Earth, their much longed for destination.Janeway is excellent in this episode and there is also fun from the Doctor, Chakotay and Seven. It is not an episode of high peril, but one that explores Janeway in a very satisfying way, presenting both the joy and disillusionment that comes from playing God with another personality. Janeway's choices throughout the episode struck me as entirely natural and reinforced her strong personality, without leaving her inhumanly untouched or uninvolved with the crew's only escape into fantasy.",10
7,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Fair Haven (TV Episode 2000)",Weaker episode,"I'm a fan of Voyager but this episode didn't do much for me; Tom has designed a new holodeck program for the the crew to relax in. This program takes the form of the 19th century Oirish village of Fair Haven. I can't imagine any village like it ever existed; while I didn't expect the story to go into the Irish politics of the time this place was so idyllic that if life in the real Ireland was half as good there would have been no troubles. Even accepting this as a deliberate error in 24th century history the story was fairly weak; after a visit to the local pub Captain Janeway falls in love with the holographic barman. As he isn't quite perfect she edits his program to make him more to her liking and to delete his wife. After three days she realises that she is behaving in a way that isn't exactly healthy, after all she couldn't change a real man so easily. When she stops going to the holodeck her barman becomes moody and takes to drink. Outside the holodeck Voyager is caught a storm which eventually threatens to destroy the ship, this means shutting off all unnecessary systems including the holodeck which leads to he program being damaged.I think this is a prime example of holodeck episodes being substandard, I never really cared about any of the holographic characters as none of them seemed real in the way the Doctor does. There were one or two nice touches, I liked the crews lack of sympathy when Tuvok felt space sick and the captain's ""delete the wife"" order.",5
8,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Fair Haven (TV Episode 2000)",Abysmal,By far the worst episode of Voyager.Hopelessly saccharine.This kind of fantasy about Ireland (the characters' and the writers') is incomprehensible to anyone not from the United States of America and particularly indigestible to those of us who actually know Ireland.The stereotyping is incredibly ignorant and the clichés come thick and fast.Diverse characters inexplicably find fascination in the society of a rather dim collection of locals. Why should Captain Janeway - supposedly an intelligent woman - suddenly find the most inane of utterances so amusing?,
9,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Fair Haven (TV Episode 2000)",Voyager hits a new low,"A lot of voyager episodes were pretty bad, it had the weakest cast of any of the the 5 series, But this episode is so bad i think it gave me cancer. First you have some of the worst Irish accents ever, this from a franchise that stopped Colm Meaney using his real accent. What makes it worse is the constant references the characters make to the authenticity yet this is entirely an American fantasy of Ireland that bears no semblance to any reality. The plot is generally substandard, but even this is too much for Kate Mulgrew to carry. Its an awful episode, rather than watch go watch the wind that shakes the barley or an episode of TNG or DS9.",1
10,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Fair Haven (TV Episode 2000)",A hollowdeck adventure....blah!,"One of the most annoying types of episodes on many of the Trek shows were the holodeck episodes. They often had NOTHING to do with the series and often went in crazy directions which seem to have nothing to do with sci-fi. Well, this is EXACTLY what you have in ""Fair Haven"". The show does zero to further the overall plot of the series and it just seems like filler.The show begins with the opening up of a new holo program by Mr. Paris. It's Fairhaven--an incredibly idealized Irish village circa 1900. Everyone is nice, the weather is always lovely and everyone acts like extras from the movie ""The Quiet Man""! Eventually the Captain enters this program and soon is intrigued by a studly holo- man. She isn't 100% impressed and alters his program a bit. Later, however, she has second thoughts. After all, it's rather yicky to imagine a woman getting it on with a pretend man.The show has very, very in the way of danger or excitement. There's a dull space storm and a bunch of Irish folk and that's all. Dull.",3
11,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Fair Haven (TV Episode 2000)",An inherent problem,"Fair Haven is another example (one of many) of Voyager episodes which mirror episodes of TNG. In this case I'm speaking of the TNG episode which deals with the Professor Moriarty character on the holodeck.These two episodes (and others like them) suffer, in my opinion, from a fatal and really stupid flaw: holodeck characters should NOT be able to reason and react the same way as living, breathing beings do. Sentience, self-awareness, reaction to crew behavior-- none of it should be possible--under any circumstances. Imagine playing World of Warcraft or some other online game, and your character turns to look directly at the screen--at YOU--and addresses you directly, knowing that you're not really a level-six mage or whatever. It can't happen in real life, and I have a hard time believing that the advanced engineers of the 24th century allow such bad programming to let it happen on Federation ship holodecks.For this reason, the fact that the entire premise on which the episode is based is faulty, I honestly can't 'buy' the action in this episode, and can't watch it.",5
12,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Fair Haven (TV Episode 2000)",Different Doesn't Make It Good,"What we have here is a romantic comedy in the style of some 1940's Maureen O'Hara movie. Paris and Kim create a holodeck program which takes place in an Irish village. It has all the stereotypical citizenry, including a barkeeper who looks like a fashion model. The Captain, lonely most of the time, takes a tumble for him, forgetting he is a hologram for a time. Perhaps we should have a comedy show where they occasionally dip into science fiction, like ""Mork and Mindy"" or ""Happy Days."" I normally don't have strong opinions. The story is sloppy and sentimental, but does nothing to carry on the journey home.",3
13,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Fair Haven (TV Episode 2000)",Sigh...,"An interesting episode that showcases Janeway's humanity through her natural desires, but yet again there's more of her arrogance that everyone seems to just ignore.

0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Blink of an Eye (TV Episode 2000)",My favorite Star Trek Voyager episode.,"As the title states, this was my favorite Voyager episode ever made. The story was perfect for an episode of Star Trek and the only thing disappointing about it was that it should've been a two-part episode giving more time to focus on the inhabitants of the world as they worship the ""Skyship."" At times I even think this could've passed as a Star Trek Movie plot. I am now learning from a previous comment that this episode was based on a book by Robert Forward and I will be checking it out as soon as possible. The Doctor's trip away from Voyager added a interesting history to the character and I think that they handled it well by just showing the doctor leaving and coming back without knowing what happened to him, then finding out later through dialog what did happen. This episode also should be noted for it's greatness because although there was a small bit of conflict at the end, this episode focused more on problem solving rather than space battles. Also it didn't rely on the return of old favorites (Borg, Q, etc.) to make it good.",10
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Blink of an Eye (TV Episode 2000)",Blink of an Eye,A very good episode although it appears to have its roots in an excellent book called 'Dragon's Egg' by Robert Forward. This concerned the discovery of a life on a Neutron star whose development was (compared to the orbiting Earth ship) hyper accelerated. The inhabitants (The Cheela) went from being a primitive civilisation to one that was far more advanced than the Earth ship in the space of a few days.This is mirrored by the Voyager episode. Perhaps the Star Trek writer did acknowledge Forward in some way just a Gene Coon did for TOS episode 'Arena'.Still it is very well done and at least the Doctor got to experience a long life down on the planet.,8
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Blink of an Eye (TV Episode 2000)",Excellent science fiction and one of the best Star Trek episodes,"I had very much the same reaction to this episode as some of the other reviewers. ""Blink of an eye"" is an example of excellent science fiction very well presented. The premise of a planet operating in an accelerated time field and its effect on societies living in it are exactly the type of thought-provoking topics science fiction was created to address. The interaction of the planet and Voyager takes place in interesting ways.The story reminds me of the cultural anthropological explorations of science fiction writers like Ursula K. Le Guin.Daniel Dae Kim gave a very strong and memorable performance as an astronaut from the planet. I'm glad to see he has gotten more opportunities to use his talents in other works.",10
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Blink of an Eye (TV Episode 2000)",Memorable,"This episode is a real grower and is, without a doubt, evidence that Voyager could rise above its predecessors with an intelligent plot.Fans of The Doctor will get an especially good kick out of this episode as he achieves some sort of humanity. It'll give you a warm smile, much in the way Data's quest for humanity did for many TNG fans.Daniel Dae Kim's appearance as Gotana-Retz is certainly welcome as is his acting which appears very basic on the surface, yet his style suits the universe so well. I could imagine him being a cast member of a future Star Trek.For me, the ending is the best part of the episode. It'll make you feel warm, happy and sad. An extremely great story that manages to put itself among the best of the Star Trek episodes.",9
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Blink of an Eye (TV Episode 2000)",Saying Goodbye to an Old Friend,"This kind of story has been told in many books and shows, most famously in an episode of The Outer Limits called ""Wolf 359"" - And in the Robert Forward book called ""Dragon's Egg"" which two other reviewers mentioned.In a way this was told in the Next Generation 1st season 17th Ep called ""Home Soil"" - But in this case, the life form is not silicon based and they are Humanoid. It was also touched on in the 2nd Season DS9 17th Episode ""Playing God"" - A Proto Universe is developing. That is probably the same story as this, but happening in a smaller Quantum- So all they can see there is the overall growth of the Proto 'Verse- So that story lacked the personal human element this one has, except for maybe returning it where it belonged.Here, we get a Donut Shaped Planet: ""The Weird Planet Where Time Moved Very Fast And So Did the People Who Lived There."" as Naomi Wildman describes it. Also - ""What we got here is a Problem with Communication"" - How do you talk to life forms that are living their whole lives in the span of a few minutes?But there are other things to deal with - As Voyager attempts to leave orbit of this unlikely orb, they get stuck. They appear as a Star in the sky of this planet, but as the planet develops they make Telescopes and can make out Voyager's Features. And, the same conundrum that has Voyager stuck like a Fly on Flypaper is causing earthquakes.But it is not Voyager's story of being stuck that makes this great or even interesting, it's how we are shown Vignettes of Life on the Planet as it develops through their centuries and Voyager's Minutes. But of ultimate interest is the story of the Astronaut played by Daniel Dae Kim and how he becomes an intermediary between his planet and Voyager. Basically it is the same as the Original Trek ""Wink of an Eye"" - Where we had aliens on the Enterprise that moved so fast they they sounded like Bugs when they talked. In this episode when Kim gets onto Voyager it's the same thing, but he is not there as an invader but as an explorer. Ironically it wasn't the change from his time to Voyager time that was a problem, but acclimation back into his own time-frame and society - Who scoffed at his return as the butt of jokes.So his return in fact stifles those jokes once and for all. It is as if someone says ""When the Sun sets down on the Moon"" or ""When Pigs Fly""- And then it Happens.This was the one time Voyager was not saved by ""Technobabble this"" from Torres or ""Borg Gadget That"" from Seven. They were at the mercy of a Civilization who was the victim of their unintentional gravitational effects for a thousand years- And this one Astronaut who was dead by the time they actually left orbit.How this planet could exist or why time is sped up on it's surface is not important, what is important is the story of the one enlightened being from the planet, the Astronaut played by Daniel Dae Kim.",10
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Blink of an Eye (TV Episode 2000)",Wonderfully Creative/One of the Better Episodes,"I remember seeing this the first time. It has kept me thinking ever since, what would happen if I or one of my kind were put in this situation. I do remember one of the original Star Trek episodes where the Enterprise and another entity were in different times. There was a whine that went on because one species was moving at incredibly high speed and sounds were distorted. For once, in this episode, there wasn't any religious gobbledegook or combative aliens. In the beginning the ""sky ship"" was seen by some as a sacred light that was responsible for many of their problems. I know it isn't perfect. There has to be some speculation, but as an absolutely gripping piece, it works very well.",10
6,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Blink of an Eye (TV Episode 2000)",A different time.,"After a weak episode Voyager is on top form again here. When a strange planet is spotted Janeway takes Voyager closer in order to investigate. As it goes into orbit Voyager gets trapped. Down on the surface a primitive race see Voyager's arrival as the arrival of a new deity which they dub ""Ground Shaker"" as Voyager's presence causes regular earthquakes. Looking down at the surface Voyager's crew notices that the seasons are changing very quickly leading them to believe that time passes much faster on the surface than it does elsewhere in the galaxy. The next time we see the people on the surface their civilisation has progressed from the stone age to their equivalent of the Middle age Europe. By the time they have developed to the ""1960s"" Janeway decides to send the Doctor to the surface to see if he can learn anything that might help them leave. It is intended to send him down for a few days; which means only three seconds should pass on Voyager. When they have difficulty beaming him back he ends up spending three years there. Not much later the people have developed rockets and send two astronauts up to Voyager which they now call the ""Sky Ship"". Once on board the two astronauts are initially still in their own time but soon change to Voyager time which only one survives. By the time he is ready to return the people on the planet have developed weapons and are attacking Voyager, he must persuade then to stop before Voyager is destroyed.This was a great episode, it was interesting to see the planet's civilisation rise while only a few days passed on board Voyager. Guest star Daniel Dae Kim, best known as Lin in Lost, does a good job as the astronaut who visits Voyager. The only weak point for me was that the astronauts stayed on planet-time for some time before suddenly changing to Voyager time; surely they would have gradually changed time rates as they ascended from the planet, this is a small quibble though.",9
7,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Blink of an Eye (TV Episode 2000)",A neat episode,"Voyager is stuck in orbit around an odd planet that is progressing far, far faster than time on Voyager. For every second on the ship, apparently a day passes below. So, the Voyager crew observe and see a society move from the bronze age to the rudiments of space travel during their short time there! However, when these astronauts arrive on Voyager, these folks see that the Voyager crew is stationary due to the time differential. I was surprised because I just assumed the locals would be on Voyager time when they entered the ship. What happens next you'll just have to see for yourself. Suffice to say, it's a really cool episode and the concepts are similar to ones shown recently in ""Interstellar"" where there is a huge time differential on the planet versus the ship in orbit. Well worth seeing and one of the better episodes.",9
8,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Blink of an Eye (TV Episode 2000)",Easily one of the best,"This episode is in a league with TNG's ""The inner light"". It is what sci-fi is all about. Great ideas, based on simple assumptions on the nature of our universe.The episode would have been perfect, if it weren't for some very annoying details:The ridiculous, uncalled for scene with the two astronauts on the frozen Voyager just proves how the writers would do anything for a 'cool scene', no matter how little sense it made. That idiot Janeway refusing to communicate with the surface after having completely violated the prime directive and refusing to defend her crew, are just more of the cheap gimmicks so often used in this series.",9
9,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Blink of an Eye (TV Episode 2000)",Great episode but...,"The premise of a planet in a accelrated evolution is interesting but not totally unique in the Star Trek world There is a episide in the original Star Trek there is a episode "" Wink of an Eye"" w a alien race that is a permanent seperate time differential. This episode is like that in reverse. Im kind of surprised no one has mentioned this. Even the title is similar. Also if you really think about this its mind blowing. To them they have normal lifespans but to us its a flys life but faster. So the blink of a fly.",9
10,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Blink of an Eye (TV Episode 2000)",Terribly Inconsistent,"(((VERY SMALL SPOILER)))Seven-of-Nine says that 1 second on Voyager is nearly a day on the planet. This means nearly 10 years would pass for every hour and roughly 230 years would pass for every day, yet many centuries pass on the planet while only a few minutes pass on Voyager. I don't know how someone could be that bad at math but that's one of the worst inconsistencies I've ever seen. This episode was very poorly written.",1
11,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Blink of an Eye (TV Episode 2000)",That was a fu**ed planet,"This episode had such an impression on me that I decided to comment on it, and I never comment on a specific episode. When I watched it I literally forgot what happened in the previous episode where someone finally realized how the grownups use the holograms. Problem is I watched it right before this episode.Time suddenly slowed down and I started feeling ill from the inability to process logic and plot holes (no, really). In fact all this time I have been thinking on the ""time is relevant"" theory. Did you know that density increases with speed (water for a speedboat is pavement)? Ever tried breathing concrete air at light speed? How about walking through it? That's one of the problems in the episode. Another is that the society is space travel handicapped – everything outside their planets time field travels so slowly, when (not if) they will run out of recourses they wont be importing anything fast enough.Encountering an organism with a faster perception rate (like a dog) is one thing, another is encountering a planet with its own time field around it. The questions left me ill and no doubt by the end of the week life on that planet was extinct one way or the other.This is an excellent example why the primary directive NEVER works – just by being seen as a shooting star you already intervene. Pray you never become a sign from destiny for a cult on a regular cargo run.",1
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Virtuoso (TV Episode 2000)",There's No Accounting for Taste,"I disagree as to the ""sub-parness"" of this episode, it was well- produced, and I agree it was well acted especially by Robert Picardo. Voyager comes in contact with a race of insulting small people. Ethnically, they dress like people from India, but lacking in the grace of those fine people from that fine country. Lacking in that grace, making up for it with rudeness. Paul Williams makes an appropriate guest appearance as the Leader of this planet, appropriate due to his many appearances in science fiction films starting with ""Phantom of the Paradise"".There does not seem to be much Voyager can offer these people - Until they hear The Doctor singing ""I've been workin' on the Railroad"".So Voyager is able to give these people Music - But they have no perception of, what is referred to in Music as ""Soul"" or ""Heart"" - Also, they will not accept Musical Input from anyone but the Doctor - When Harry Kim gives them an example of Jazz, they almost boo him off the stage - Until the Doctor starts singing.So the Doctor gives his first Large Scale Command Performance - To a whole Planet! To say he has the jitters is an understatement. But he overcomes this small obstacle, due to his huge Ego. Voyager's communications array is overrun with ""Fan Mail"" for the Doctor and this makes matters worse!I suppose, this episode was designed to explore this aspect of The Doctor, and this race are his perfect Patrons - He can do no wrong for them.The problem is, they WANT him! And in the Doctor's Photonic Mind, he wants to stay. But when he tenders his resignation to Janeway, she reminds him of what usually happens to Pop Stars on Earth - They are allotted 15 minutes of fame, in other words, until the next ""fad"" comes around.One of the Doctors Alien Fanatics, presents him with an un-singable musical piece. Also, a very poorly written musical piece. The Doctor is as diplomatic about this as he can be, but he is not able to convey to these people that Music is not just Mathematics, there is also emotion involved.So they make a new Doctor, in their image, who can sing the horrible cacophony this woman has written.The Doctor sings his holographic heart out in his farewell performance - But the whole planet likes the ""improved"" doctor much more. There is no accounting for Taste!After being brought down a peg or two, the Doctor resumes his duties in Sick Bay. But he receives one more Fan Mail - From Seven of Sixty-Nine.I suppose, it is not the amount of fans a Musical Artist has - But the Quality of them. and in Seven, he has all he needs - ""All the Live Long Day!""",10
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Virtuoso (TV Episode 2000)",Loved the Qomar!,"The Doctor is so susceptible to flattery. The Qomar, perhaps the snobbiest and hard to like aliens ever, hear the Doc singing, ""I Been Working on the Railroad."" Since they've never heard of music, they are utterly taken with his voice. This makes him put aside his animus toward them and embrace their compliments. He is soon the new Enrico Caruso of this part of the galaxy. It turns out, however, that there is more to his gig than simple adulation. Quite funny, but an oddity to say the least.",6
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Virtuoso (TV Episode 2000)","""Plot holes"" re: The Doctor","I've been ""binge watching"" Voyager, as I missed large chunks of it, when it first aired. In several episodes, this one being the most glaring example, there is a problem with the way that the Doctor's existence is dealt with.Okay, he has evolved beyond the parameters of his original programming, to the point of being a sentient being. Got that.However, his ""being"" or ""soul"" is still a computer program. The aliens in this episode, apparently, have vastly superior technology to Voyager. So, why couldn't they just ""copy and paste"" the Doctor to one of their computers? ... And their replicators appear to be superior to Voyager's, so they could replicate another mobile emitter.Are we supposed to believe that the advanced technology of this era in Star Trek has lost the ability to ""copy and paste""?In essence, clone him. How many other Sci-Fi shows have done the same, that you know of? The first case that comes to my mind is in Doctor Who. When a ""copy"" of the 10th Doctor went into an alternate reality to live with Rose.---There have been previous instances in the show where a simple ""copy and paste"" would have solved the crisis with the Doctor. I'm sure there will be more.",
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Virtuoso (TV Episode 2000)","First there was Beatle-mania, now there is Doc-mania!","""Virtuoso"" is a very slight episode, though it is enjoyable. It all begins with Voyager coming into contact with a VERY self-satisfied and smug planet. They feel that Voyager and its crew are beneath them...at least until they happen to overhear the Doctor singing. Suddenly, these folks are entranced and respond to him like he's Elvis or the Beatles in their prime! These folks are now begging him to put on a series of concerts. Heck, they'd even love to have him come live on the planet forever. But this serves to give the Doc a very, very swelled head and soon it's practically impossible to live with him. So what's next? See the show yourself.One very odd thing is that the famous singer/song writer Paul Williams appears in this one but his part is very small. I saw a documentary about the guy recently and apparently he was struggling with addictions until he ultimately got straight and is now an addictions counselor. Perhaps this was during his chemically dependent period, as this would seem the only reason to have such an impressive guest and barely use him. Oh, and good luck to you, Mr. Williams!",7

Voyager returns the aliens to their home world where the Doctor becomes adored like The Beatles when they first came to America. The Doctor must decide if he wants to stay on this planet where he is worshiped as a singer or remain with the Voyager. There is also the question of if he should be allowed to leave the ship, since he is in essence an Emergency Medical Hologram.Robert Picardo turns in a fine performance in this episode, and there are some great scenes with him and Kate Mulgrew, but this is one of the show's weaker episodes.It's still worth watching as it brings up some interesting concepts about exactly how to classify the Doctor now. Hologram property of Starfleet or a sentient being. In a way this is a courtroom episode, but instead of a courtroom it takes place in a concert hall.",5
6,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Virtuoso (TV Episode 2000)",A rather disappointing episode,"Oh dear, this was not a great episode; while Robert Picardo's acting as the Doctor can't be faulted the story about him finding fame as a singer on an alien planet was just boring. When Voyager picks up a group of aliens they aren't impressed with the Doctor as they consider him to be a primitive hologram with limited medical skills; however when he starts to sing while working they are enchanted as they have never heard music before. They can't get enough of his singing and invite him to perform a concert on their planet, he is an instant megastar with people queueing to buy a singing holographic image of him. Flattered by their invitation to stay he tenders his resignation to Captain Janeway. He has a disappointment in store however when he finds that one of the aliens has designed a new hologram with a greater singing range than his own.I know not every episode is going to be packed with action and danger, indeed some of the best episodes feature neither, they do all need to be interesting. The idea that the Doctor might leave to become a singer just didn't ring true, I could have accepted it if he had considered leaving to provide medical aid to a people in need but not to become an entertainer.",5

When they beam down to the surface they recognise the scenery but their is no sign of a recent massacre, they do however find what looks like a memorial and in the caves where Harry recalls killing two people they find two three hundred year old skeletons.This was a pretty good episode which kept me interested in finding out just what the four people on the away mission had been involved in.

4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Memorial (TV Episode 2000)",Was pretty darn interesting till they totally fudged up the ending...,"OK, firstly, I'm writing this to ""balance the books"", as they say. I noticed there were only two other reviews for this episode. And in spite of the fact the overall score was only at 7.0 at the time of my writing this, both those existing reviews (positive as they are) might leave somebody approaching this episode with an overly positive outlook on its supposed goodness, in my humble opinion.So, here are my thoughts on this episode. It was quite interesting. It was well acted, and dramatized, in my humble opinion...then the Producers had to go all 21st Sucktury TV Standard on us, and make Janeway into an IDIOT again...for a change. Now, I LOVE Janeway - WHEN the writers aren't turning her into a moron who makes questionable choices, and comes to make equally questionable decisions. And, oh yeah, behaves ERRATICALLY. As Seven might say, there's a reason ""erratic"" is over half way to spelling ERROR. OK, so maybe she wouldn't say that lol, I'm don't know. My point however, still stands.These Producers did this trick with Archer, in Enterprise - much to my utter disdain. But, in case you aren't familiar with this show, they occasionally did this with Janeway too - though perhaps not in as annoying a way. Maybe that's my liking for Janeway coming through. When they're not making her into a moron, it's my opinion that she's a sweetypie - and a VERY capable Captain. But they sometimes make her make STUPID choices. On occasion, said choices SEEM stupid at first, but then we realize she might be/is right. And is, in fact, being a good leader. This, is NOT one of those occasions.Now, some might say something like, ""But we all make mistakes, and we're all only human. Of COURSE she makes mistakes!"", but that's not what I'm talking about. I'm addressing those moments where an established character seems to behave out of character, and make a choice SO stupid that it's unforgivable. A sort of LOGIC choice where it's OBVIOUS what would be the correct choice to make. What they did here, at the end of this episode, is make Janeway make a choice which would result in bringing about suffering - WORSE SUFFERING THAN THE CREW THEMSELVES EXPERIENCED IN THIS EPISODE - upon others. And it was ALL done in the name of ""Avoiding future similar tragedies like this from ever happening again""....You know how you take a big butcher knife out of your kitchen drawer?...And you proceed to go up to your 5 year old kid, kneel down beside them, and say to them, ""You know how I say that knives can be very dangerous, and you have to be very careful when handling them?""?...And your child says, ""Yes""....And then you then say to them, ""Well, this is the reason why...This is what can happen if you don't treat them with respect, and great care..."", and you proceed to saw through your forearm, till the blood is free-flowing and they can hear the sound of the teeth of the serrated blade, sawing against the bone of your arm? YEAH? You know those moments when you do this exact kind of thing? Well, that's this show's ending. ;P When I say 21st Sucktury TV Standard, maybe that makes more sense now lol... ;) I do hope so. Cause this kind of idiotic talking down to the viewing public is common place in 2016. It's been going on for 20+ years now, but it's never been as bad as it is now.Sooooo, anyways...I do hope this review didn't bore you! I hope it shone a light on some important stuff, and was of use to you. I nearly forgot an important point most would-be viewers will want to know - ""Can you skip this episode?"". YES. The answer, thankfully, is yes - if you so choose. It won't have any real bearing on anything. You might wish to watch it once, then not bother again. Personally, I wouldn't have bothered, if I'd have known the manner of its ending in advance, though. But the choice is yours, of course.I rate it 8 for the acting (apart from Neelix's/Janeway's toward the end - which was, in fact, just cruddy script writing/Producing). Overall, I feel I MUST give it an Episode Score of 2, however. Live long, and prosper...",2

When Seven wakes she finds that Tuvok is badly injured and that she is expected to take part in the Tsunkatse matches.

A Hirogen volunteers to prepare Seven for this fight and back on Voyager everybody searches for the source of the signal. They find the ship as Seven enters the arena and finds out that her opponent will be the Herogen who trained her.This was a good episode which showed just how human Seven of Nine has become, Jeri Ryan does a good job in the role.

1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Tsunkatse (TV Episode 2000)",It's a lot of fun until it's someone you love,"Voyager is taking shore leave on some planet. Inexplicably, some of the crew, including Chakotay and Torres, enjoy going to a 'sporting' event that is a lot like the gladiators. Their enjoyment of this made little sense in light of how pacifistic and nice folks from the Federation are in the 24th century. Regardless, their enjoyment is cut short when they see Seven of Nine in the arena getting her butt kicked. But the ship cannot beam her out, as it turns out that the fighters are NOT right in front of them but are fighting remotely and their holograms appear in the arena. This means Seven IS fighting but not on this planet. Where is she, how are they going to get her back and what about Tuvok? After all, he was on a shuttle with her when she was kidnapped.The only thing that I didn't like was seeing Voyager crew members attending such a nasty thing. It just didn't make sense. But it was otherwise interesting and worth seeing.",7
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Tsunkatse (TV Episode 2000)",Between THE ROCK and a Hard Place,"There is a lot of great stuff in this little shenanigan - We start off by Seeing a Hirogen (J.G. Hertzler) beat the tar out of some skinny oaf. I liked the oaf, no cast listing so I suppose it was Stuntee Clayton J. Barber getting his Arse handed to him like a hat in the teaser of this gem.This show revolves around the sport of ""Tsunkatse"" which the crew of Voyager has been enjoying along with every other alien in the sector. It reminds me of some of the popular contact sports being played around that time, the Tsunkatse Arena looks like any contact sport that was ever played on UPN13 in LA. I remember they had a contact form of Football called ""XFL"" at the time that lasted for a few years- The biggest boost that form of football ever had was in the movie ""The Sixth Day"".Unfortunately, Tsunkatse was not just an innocent Monday Night Sports offering for your local Dive Bar - As Seven of Sixty-Nine and Tuvix find out to their pain. They are kidnapped by an alien form of Jeffery Coombs and forced to play Tsunkatse or DIE. So Seven agrees, if anything to save Tuvix from a ""Red Deth Match"".And her Opponent for this thing was interesting: This was the very first time I ever saw Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. He makes a GREAT Alien, his face in Profile was an Iconic view. That's when I KNEW he had a future as an actor and not only as a well built piece of meat (With Machine Guns added if you count ""Doom"" or ""GI-JOE: Retaliation).Unfortunately in the clips of the TsunKatse matches, JG Herztler gets skinnier at certain times, while he does some amazing kicks and spins, and Seven's whole FACE changes while she stiff-arms The Rock in a few pain inducing moves. Does the sport of Tsunkatse cause Shape-Shifting to occur or was ODO glad to see me?That has always been a problem with Trek, editing out Stuntwoman Monica Staggs's face in crucial scenes. But Jeri Ryan could do some great movements in closeup, so when the real Monica Staggs does the hard moves, the closeup makes you believe it was really Seven.And These Hirogen were some great fighters. Hertzler's Hirogen (He was never given a name) teaches Seven a thing or two about Survival and the art of Tsukatse: But in the end, he intended to have Seven kill him so he could have a death worthy of a Hirogen. Hirogens are great, from their Butt-Style heads to their Armor that could allow them to walk through a Neutron Star, they are by far my most Favourite Delta Quadrant Aliens- And Hertzler gives them a more likable personality.Of course, Voyager can't have their pet Borg beating up Hirogen on TV, so they cause a Media Blackout much like the Syndex (Exclusivity) Laws from the 1990's.Of Course, a lot of this is just plain Silly, but The Rock's little cameo and the Hirogen Teacher made this great Network TV in the late 90's/2000's. Personally, I think Seven could have ripped Dwayne's head off and fed it to the Hirogen while they danced playing Violins and setting Janeway's hair on fire, but I highly enjoyed this when it was first broadcast as well as now. God/The Prophets Love The Rock!",10
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Tsunkatse (TV Episode 2000)","The Rock and Spock Connection was an indeed a clever marketing ploy, but this episode was so crude and pointless.","Don't get me wrong, I get the idea, why the, then-UPN (United Paramount Network) cross-promote, their 'Star Trek: Voyager' show with that of then-WWF (World Wrestling Federation) 'Smackdown' show. After all, during the early 2000s, 'Smackdown' was the network's highest-rated program, while 'Star Trek: Voyager', by far, the weakest of all of the 'Star Trek: New Generation' spin-off shows, numbering in a few viewers each week. Thus, it seemed only natural to cross-promote it to increase the latter's viewership. The plan work, as 15th episode achieved a Nielsen rating of 4.1 million homes, and a 6% share, making it the highest rated episode of season 6. However, couldn't they make this episode directed by Mike Vejar, a little more sophisticated than what we got!? This Star Trek: Voyager episode written by Gannon Kenney was kinda dumb, only feeding our low brow animistic urges. Originally called 'Arena', before being changed at the last minute, because of the similarities of that title with Star Trek: the Original Series' Season 1, Episode 18 'Arena'. The story tells the story of USS Voyager crew member, Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) getting captured while on an away mission and being forced to fight in a gladiator-like fight competition. Without spoiling this hastily-written predictable episode, too much, I have to say, the story is nothing, but a rehash of the typical ""forcing a Star Trek character to fight against their will"", we seem before in Star Trek episodes, such as 'Star Trek: the Original Series' Season 2, Episode 1 'Amok Time' & 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine' 15th episode, season 5 'By Inferno's Light'. It wasn't anything new, nor does it give us anything special, beyond, seeing Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson in one of his first acting roles, even if he's pretty much, playing himself as Pendari Champion, with doing pro-wrestling style stunt moves like the 'Rock Bottom' & doing ""The People's Eyebrow,"" a typical Rock gesture. It was a bit disappointing, seeing how Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson was wasted. His character wasn't complex at all. His make-up work was cheaply done and his suit look like putty patrol on steroids. He was a bit shallow. Don't get me wrong, the episode was somewhat entertaining, due to the lowbrow action exploitation violence exploitation, but it doesn't match well, with the Star Trek New Generation smart pacifistic style of solving conflict. Isn't it, a bit weird to see the humanism and optimism aristocratic crew of the USS Voyager turn into blood-driven fanatics, by cheering for people beating up other people? I guess, human society in the 24th century hasn't evolved that much, if extreme animistic personality still existed. It totally sold out Gene Roddenberry's ideal society out. One thing I found a little shortsighted on the part of the Voyager crew was the notion that they weren't really aware of the extent of the Tsunkatse ring violence. How could they not heard about it? They had to see at less, one of these 'red match' in which the fighter, fight a battle to the death. After all, the episode told us, that those matches were very popular. It's doesn't make sense, even if we're to believe that the Federation banned such fighting from airing. Somebody would had told them. Plus, it's a bit preachy, to present the episode, where seeing two people fight to the death is fun to watch, based on the trailer, only to later, recount, how wrong, it was, in story terms. It's not very well conscious. It's a bit of guilt-shaming. Plus, I'm somewhat disappointing with the few guest performances that this episode had. They really didn't help elevate the material, any further than it turn out. First off, I found Jeffery Comb's cameo as martial arts fighting Norcadian promoter, Penk, somewhat offensive and demeaning to Asian Americans. Jeffrey Combs looks like Dana Carvey in really bad Asian Fu Manchu stereotypical make-up. I would rather see, Jeffery Comb play, yet another Weyoun clone than this over-the-top and shallow villain. The other important character here is the Hirogen warrior played by J.G Hertzler. He was a little better than Combs, as he had a commanding presence as he teaches Seven in the ways of the fighting, but somewhere in me, kinda wish, he was playing a Klingon or better yet, a Gorn. Jeri Ryan as Seven was alright for the most part in a physical role. She did some of her own stunt work, and pretty much, match well with both Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and J.G Hertzler. It's somewhat believable that her character could probably take down, both men if she really wanted to. Her dilemma of losing her humanity and going back to the Borg ways, was somewhat interesting, but it wasn't very compelling, because her fight scene took place, in what looks like an old American Gladiator set. It was very cheap-looking and jarring. This whole episode looks, pretty bad with the lazy make up effects, lightning and limited CGI. In the end, this episode felt very unnecessary.

Which unfortunately is the ""European"" Backlot of Paramount. It's a given that Tom got details wrong, remember Janeway shows Tom that he got the HARP backward on Sullivan's Pub Sign? Never in either of these Fairhaven Episodes does it state that Fairhaven is an exact dupe of any town in Ireland. Besides, it was made for Voyager crew, not you.And did Those Feet in Ancient Times, walk upon England's Mountain's Green? Nope. Besides, William Blake was referring to The Industrial Revolution aka ""Urban Creep"" which he hated. Nevertheless, Calvinists everywhere sing that song as a Hymn.So this Holo has been running for weeks now, remember- it almost got demolished by the Ion Storm and 70% of it had to be rebuilt. But there are still Ghosts in The Machine.Tom is driving around in his horseless carriage. The Town panhandler ""Seamus"" (Richard Riehle) causes him to crash it, and Seamus sees Tom ""repair"" his wheel. Then Tom changes Maggie O'Halleran (Henriette Ivanans) into a COW, and someone sees The Doctor change her back.Fairhaven like any town will be subject to Rumour, which will eventually ""Walk the Ground with Head Hidden in the Clouds"" (Virgil's The Aeneid).But the 'Deck is malfunctioning, the Holograms are reacting to things they ought not react to.

When the Doctor interrupts, they tie him up too and steal his Emitter.That's when the fun begins, Sullivan gets beamed to The Bridge and now Janeway has a Headache. Basically this is ""First Contact"" with a new Life Form, and now the crew has to earn Fairhaven's Trust, now that they know what they are.When I first saw these episodes I was hoping they would have more of them, but like Janeway's Davinci Program, they were a One-Season Deal. We did not see Da Vinci much after Seasons 4 and 5. Most of the Detractors of Fairhaven forget that this was not for our benefit, it was for Voyager's. If you take that into account, then the interactions that occur in these episodes can be enjoyed a lot more, including The Doctor's Pompous Sermons.

I've seen a few reviewers that simply give 9s or 10s to every episode. Well, I've got shocking news--some show DID occasionally suck! This is especially true on ""Star Trek: Voyager"". All too many episodes simply should have been ditched. In fact, instead of seven seasons of shows that varied tremendously in quality, I would have preferred five really good seasons. Had they ditched all the Fair Haven show, it would have been a great start!A few episodes back, Mr. Paris made the Irish town of Fair Haven on the holodeck. Within the program everyone is happy and everything is perfect. There is no IRA, there is no British occupation, there is no potato famine and there is no division between Catholics and Protestants. Here everyone gets along wonderfully and welcomes strangers. In other words, it's nothing like the Ireland circa 1910 like it's supposed to be!Here in the second Fair Haven another cliché appears--that these are all simple, foolish and highly superstitious folk. When one of them sees Mr. Paris doing things like talking to the computer or fixing a flat tire instantly or turning a lady into a cow for a joke, he realizes there's something amiss. Soon the others also catch on and the entire village is ready to weigh the strangers to see if they weigh as much as a duck!The bottom line is that this has as much to do with sci-fi as a lump of butter. The plot is ridiculous, clichéd and embarrassing. Another episode that never would have been made had the writers not been drinking a few too many pints of Guinness!Also, for laughs, try watching this with a few Irish friends.

This wouldn't necessarily be a problem if the holedeck characters were interesting or had anything interesting to do, but they aren't and they don't- not exactly a good recipe for exciting or meaningful sci-fi television.On the plus side, fans of the talented Robert Picardo will enjoy some very funny scenes with the Doctor playing an overly dramatic village priest. And the Voyager cast seems to be having a sincerely good time romping around in this colorful period piece (which features on location shooting at Universal Studio's European Village Backlot set, which the cast undoubtedly enjoyed). Unfortunately, the cast are the ONLY ones having fun, and the audience is left to suffer through it.The largest plot hole, in my opinion, is the fact that the Voyager crew spends an incredible amount of time, energy, and attention worrying about, and fussing with, this pointless holedeck program and its characters. Surely the crew can find better & more meaningful things to occupy their time and the ship's resources (like exploring the UNIVERSE, maybe?) than fiddling with a 3D video game. I know that if I was in a starship in the Delta Quadrant, I wouldn't be sitting sitting in my quarters the whole time focused on my XBox360.It's just a holedeck program.

Guest star Kim Rhodes was really good in the role making be care about what happened to the character.

The best thing about it is the make-up, as the Ensign and other of her new kind are simply gorgeous and among the best looking aliens on any of the Trek shows.

So not much can really be said about this episode, it explains itself as it goes.But it is an important episode as it gives us a possible explanation as to why there can be Queen after Borg Queen, recreated after being Blown Up, Vaporized, or otherwise completely destroyed. And the Kobali sphere of Influence must intersect the Borg Sphere in a few places.If you think of it, this episode elevated the Borg to Godlike Quality. If they have the DNA of every Drone they ever Assimilated, they can recreate those drones time after time.And it is not really too far out, even Cosmologist Frank Tipler shows how this can be done in one of his books. Eventually the Human Race will have the ability to re-create any life form from it's saved DNA. In the case of The Borg, they don't even need physical Strands of the DNA, they have the patterns stored in their massive Memory. And I stopped NOT believing that something like this could be done a long time ago. Tipler calls this Theory part of the Omega Point Theory, and it's even a small part of it at that.To me, it does not conflict with any Faith that believes in Resurrection, it confirms it. But when it comes down to it, Faith does not require knowing how something is done, just believing it CAN be done. Really, think about it: ""God made the World and Mankind"" does it really matter HOW?A little science fiction is good to explore ""How"" theories, and that's all it is anyway, a Theory.

When Janeway throws up her arrogant sass that everyone else seems to find so charming, Crewman Harran completely takes her down a notch or two and her facial reaction is glorious. The plot is going well. Janeway basically compares herself to Jesus and takes the 3 misfits under her wing on their first away mission to prove themselves. Off they go to look at some cool stars. Part of the hull gets sheered off by an unknown force, they lose warp drive, and send out a distress call.Then Telfer gets transported into Dark Matter world or something, and the episode goes off the rails. He immediately comes back with a worm inside him, which then proceeds to take control of his body, then launch of his body, and squirm on the environmental controls before Harran blows it to kingdom come. Janeway is mad that she missed having ""first contact"" with the worm even though it was about to decompress the ship. They make a run for some planetary to rings to try to recharge their warp drive a bit, and start getting chased by more invisible space worms. Janeway orders them to the escape pods and to make for a habitable moon to wait for help. Two refuse, but Herran says ""see ya!"" Turns out he's trying to be a hero by drawing the worms away. Janeway foils his plans and rescues him as they make a run for it.I called this episode a wasted opportunity because in the end everything just goes white and Janeway wakes up and sick bay. We don't get any kind of epilogue to show how the experience affected the 3 misfits. There's no real redemption. Instead Janeway just smiles smugly at how successful she was at being ""a good shepherd,"" and roll credits. I gave it 3 stars because, while it has some good visual effects, the story just crumbles once they encounter the worm things. How should it have gone? Perhaps they should have crashed on the moon she talked about later. Janeway is injured/unconscious, and now each of the three must face their shortcomings and overcome them to save their captain and themselves. Instead we got Janeway constantly pulling them out of the fire while they sheepishly smile in gratitude and supposedly learn things. Booo.",3

Normally none of them would have remained for long on a starship but being trapped in the Delta Quadrant that isn't an option. As none of them have ever been on an away mission Captain Janeway decides to take them on what should be a routine mission. Things go wrong when something hits the Delta Flyer, knocks off panel as well as putting the warp core out of commission. Unable to contact Voyager the captain and the three misfits must figure out what is wrong and find a way to get back to Voyager... this isn't made any easier when they come into conflict with strange space based alien creatures.It was nice to see that not everybody on Voyager is cut out for life aboard a starship, but not surprisingly when the chips are down they perform admirable and learn from their experience. While the problems they encountered were the sort of thing the regulars seem to deal with every week it was made more interesting for relying on less than stunning crew members.",8

This is a typical episode for Season 6, in which the writers focused on new characters (the Borg children (""Collective"", Lt. Barclay ""Pathfinder"") and interactions with new species (""Dragon's Teeth"", ""Virtuoso"", ""Blink of an Eye""). This makes Season 6 slightly disappointing, as the regular characters seem stagnated for much of the season.""Good Shepherd"" does little to advance or explore the regular characters but still succeeds, mostly because of the creative decision to make the three crewmen less than competent. This contrasts directly with the characters of ""Lower Decks"" and creates a more realistic impression of life upon Voyager: it always does seem rather convenient that the bridge crew never makes mistakes. Further, it introduces new conflicts, the sort that we were promised when Voyager began - this was supposed to be a starship where the crew had interpersonal conflicts all the time, remember.As a side note, this isn't the first time the show has been connected with ""Lower Decks"" - Ensign Vorek is first seen on that episode before reappearing in several Voyager episodes throughout the seasons.",7

We even have Seven doing unwanted and unauthorized studies of the crew that lead to friction among the regular characters (see also Seven's study of Tom and B'Lanna's relationship, ""Someone to Watch Over Me"", season 5).All in all, it's an okay way to pass an hour, but I think this is the point where we first saw that the series was running out of stories to tell.",5

So much for natural assumptions. Instead we have three crewmen in this plot being unwillingly groomed for higher Star Fleet aspirations. Despite these crewmen's respective talent (or lacking); they're not very ambitious or enthused about this Away Mission.An inadvertent problem occurs that will test them like they've never considered. Working together and utilizing each other's strength makes them a formidable foe, against all odds. It also makes this rare approach, on average, par for the course.

It was a nauseous, disturbingly sad scene.And so, via the Voyager crew, an age old religion, the group-cult, exhibiting a group-think mentality of which even the Borg must be envious is ever with us (ref: Carrie). Thus enter the religious tie-in of the Captain as a stand in for Christ himself.On first thought this was a heart warming episode of bringing back into the fold (sheep) the lost ones. But on second thought this is merely another instance of the co-opting a religious concept to enhance the current group-think more Borg than thou mindset currently in vogue.Great acting by the outcasts.

Roddenberry believed, as did others that great art, theater, etc, when done thoughtfully and meaningfully would emancipate the human race from all it's faults, that faults that bring humans to the brink of war. So much of the original series was about that very point, and here we have it played out beautifully, with B'lanna the ersatz Roddenberry and the play she and the playwright virtually improvise a plea for clear headed thinking that would lead to a peaceful resolution of a military conflict.

Not only that, but she was immediately ""replaced"" with someone who seemed to be nothing but eye-candy, as if there was an attempt to please with a titillation factor at the expense of getting rid of a truly good-hearted character on board. However, Seven really grew on me and in retrospect, I am very glad she was brought on the show as she is a great character.In reality, the actress didn't know of her being let go until she got the script for this episode. If Kes wasn't bitter when she left, I was. Some could be excited to see the character again. Was this going to be an episode to give her the proper goodbye or remembrance that she deserved? However she was definitely not portrayed in a graceful manner.In fact, throughout most of the episode, she is a villain. If anything about Kes was true during the majority of her stay on Voyager, she was an extremely caring, forgiving, and even wise person, despite her young age. This did not seem to jive with the bitter personality that she had in this episode, and her selfishness at being willing to sacrifice the lives of the crew to save her prior self. True that in the end, she had a change of heart.

For some inexplicable reason, they brought the character Kes back, which wasn't a bad idea, but how they handled this was a HUGE disappointment. When I first saw this episode when it debuted, I hated it. Now, after seeing it again, I realize that first impressions are often on the mark.When the show begins, Kes appears on the viewscreen and asks permission to come aboard the ship. However, she deliberately flies the ship into Voyager and then walks about the ship using her super- duper mind powers destroying things. She is impervious to phasers and she seems intent on destroying everyone aboard. However, the episode then does some stupid temporal crap and the episode goes back and forth in time--a sure sign that the show stinks. This plot device has been used way too many times and here it's used to give us TWO Kes at the same time--one which is evil Kes and the other nice old Kes. It's all very confusing and ultimately culminates with evil Kes once again attacking the ship in the exact same fashion but this time Janeway meets her and convinces Kes that Voyager loves her and she's mistaken to be so mad at them. Kes apologizes and disappears and everyone is happy!The episode is weary and dumb. There is absolutely no reason for Kes to be back and certainly no reason for her to be an angry super- being. This anger is inexplicable and must have really irritated many fans who liked this character. Why make her evil?! Why bring her back with a completely sub-standard plot?!

She changes her appearance to look like her former self before stunning her younger self and hiding her in a drawer. While nobody realises she isn't the young Kes she has an effect on Tuvok who has flashes of the future; in one he sees Naomi and follows her to the cargo bay where he sees Seven and the Borg children. At first it is assumed it is just an hallucination to when Janeway asks the Doctor she learns that Ensign Wildman is indeed pregnant with a girl. While this is going on Voyager is trying to keep clear of the Vidiians but Kes is giving them information so they can seize Voyager and she can take her younger self back to Ocampa.Kes was one of my favourite characters in the early seasons so it was great to see her again. It was interesting that instead of being full of happy memories about her time on Voyager she felt bitter and wants to change her past so she doesn't stay aboard and also make the crew suffer; blaming them for encouraging her to develop her mental skills which led to her having to leave the ship. Jennifer Lien was great in the role of Kes, it was a shame that she got dropped from the cast at the end of series three. I'm glad that her return was in an episode with a good story.

4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Fury (TV Episode 2000)",When Ocompans get Old,"They may get Senile as well as Humans do.My only problem with this Ep is that Kes would not be a Bag Ocompan at 6 years. As far as the other complaints that this is another Asskick to Jennifer, those are not valid complaints. The reason why they are not valid is because I never even knew that Jennifer had been let go without one word that she was being replaced by a Borg with huge cybernetic Implants. What do they do, spout streams of Borg Nanoprobes? Seems like the Borg would remove all gender identity from all drones. I never knew of this shabby treatment by a people putting on a show about an ""Enlightened"" Civilization like the United Federation of Planets, acting instead like a member of some kind of ""Red"" political party. One that uses that Colour not one that is called that Colour by the ones who USE that Colour. In fact, I don't blame the Voyager Producers at all, I blame United Paramount/BET Network as it was at the time. But as to why complaints about this Episode are invalid, is because who would know that but hard core Trekkers? Most people who casually watch a show roll with the punches. Most people and myself never consider the politics of Network TV.In fact I never knew why Kes suddenly vanished. All I knew is that I was bummed. So, when this episode was originally broadcast, I was excited about it because it was a Kes episode.And I liked it. We had seen Kes taken over by a Warlord and to get rid of that personality she had to use the same tactics the Warlord used- In the end of that episode, Kes worked with Tuvok to deal with the memory of that experience.So an aged, angry obsessed and possibly senile Kes was not too far of a stretch. She was old - She had been separated from Voyager for a few years. We know also that she was a very powerful being as well as a very strong person. So I don't believe she would have aged that much in only 2 years, and I don't believe she would do what she set out to do.Nevertheless I suspended my disbelief just so I could enjoy this one episode.Let us just assume that somehow, Kes after separating from the nurturing Voyager environment aged rapidly and started accepting more and more of the anger left in here by The Warlord. Perhaps that liaison with the Warlord was a trigger that seeped into her subconsciousness - She had been forced into inactivity while that entity took over her body and used her powers to hurt people. But she also interacted with that being, and even after he left that memory would remain, that evil would lie dormant.So when she rams her shuttle into Voyager, destroys a whole deck and causes the death of a crewman this was in fact not Kes at all but The Warlord's influence.Her goal? To return her younger self home. This seething angry person decides to give Voyager into the waiting and salivating hands of one of Voyager's most hated enemies.This was not Kes at all. This was not the act of the enlightened spiritual being that left Voyager and shunted the ship 9000 light-years across the main bulk of Borg Space. This was the act of a person who had been left alone and had aged more quickly than she would have aged if she had stayed on the ship, and in aging let bitterness take over.I think she was holding back, she could have vaporized Voyager, killed Janeway with one finger, who knows what she could have done to Neelix. But she always stopped short of doing even greater harm. I believe even in that distraught state she still had the kind Kes deep inside.That's why I could also suspend disbelief when all it took was a message from herself to shock her back to sanity. I think she had been there all the time.We all have the capacity to do things in great anger which we be instantly are remorseful for- The trick is to stop ourselves before this happens. If we can do it with ourselves in this life, then Kes could have done it to herself in that story.But if we have to blame anyone for this, we can blame Brannon ""Temporal Causality Loop"" Braga. But I don't, cos I enjoyed the story, was glad to see Kes and I love the very last line by Neelix. And, we forget, Voyager was a NETWORK show, and able to be canceled like any other network show. I don't believe that Jennifer's being let go was a choice the creators and producers of the show really wanted, the ""United Paramount Network"" handed this can of worms to Trek with the choice ""Or Be Cancelled""- Remember, at the time of ""Scorpion"" which was the 3rd year of UPN, UPN had canceled ALL of their original ""Dramatically Different"" shows, save Voyager, and were running very BAD ethnic comedies in their place. And I have said before I do not dislike Ethnic Comedies, just BAD comedies, which these where. So to keep Voyager voyaging for another four years, Jennifer was fired and a Borg with Huge... Implants had to be hired in her place.Just think of how great this show could have been if Both actresses could have remained, as well as Harry Kim who was the other Voyager member to be scrutinized by the Paramount crew-removing Hatchet.So I don't Blame Trek. I blame Paramount for Hosting a Trek show but not giving Berman full control over it.

It's a new twist on the old Campfire Ghost story.The director uses some unique angles for the scenes that are supposed to take place during Neelix's story, and there are some cool effects shots.We also get to see crewman Tal Celes, who we first met 5 episodes earlier in ""Good Shepherd"".This episode was probably done as a budget saver with the season finale coming up the following week.

Now considering it has Neelix AND kids, it seemed to have two strikes against it--yet it turns out to be a pretty good show. The story Neelix ends up telling isn't really a story at all--it's what's been happening on the ship. But he phrases it like a story and the kids relax. It turns out that the ship is experiencing lots of random electronic problems. However, after a while, it is obvious they aren't random at all--and soon IMPORTANT systems begin malfunctioning. How the Captain deals with all this is surprisingly intelligent and the episode, to me, is quite creative. It manages to combine Kids, Neelix and a ship-bound episode into a decent show and the ghost story style really helps.",8

When they immediately become bored, Neelix tells them he will confide in them the story of what happened to Voyager before they came on board. He launches into wild tale of a gaseous life form taking over the ship and pushing the crew to their very limits. We are aware that this may or may not be a story. We ourselves may have been left in the dark. The story is exciting and shows what a gift our imaginations are.

To pass the time he tells them the equivalent of a ghost story; this story is set shortly before the children came aboard and is shown as a flashback although it isn't clear if he is telling a story or relaying facts about what why they are entering the nebula.He tells them how Voyager had entered the nebular before in order to harvest fuel materials, unfortunately it harvested something else; a life form living in the nebula that enters Voyager's systems. At first it isn't spotted; when it causes problems with the ship's systems they are initially thought to be random malfunctions. As it takes over more systems the crew realise it what it is it is late to do anything about it.

Mostly I like Star Trek for how it makes you think but sometimes it's nice to take a load off and just have some fun. The whole idea of Unimatrix Zero is cool and unique and Voyager wanting to help preserve it is a great premise. Not to mention I always love Borg episodes that involve Janeway and the Borg Queen.What I don't really love is the way they jump the shark toward the end when part of Janeway's plan is to have her and her away team actually become Borg drones with some sort of inhibitor from the doctor to keep the voices of the collective out of their heads. When Picard got assimilated in TNG it was a huge deal. Bringing him back was treated as no small task and he had to suffer with their implants in him for pretty much the rest of his life. Seven of Nine reinforces this notion that leaving the collective is a life-long process even if we're only talking about the superficial mechanical components and ignoring the mental journey.They brush off this over the top plan by feeding the audience some hand-waving explanation about them not being Borg for too long so they can be totally reverted back to normal. This flies in the face of Locutus who was a Borg for less than a day and struggles the rest of his life because of it.Ultimately it's still a fun episode. I just wish the writers could have thought a little harder about a clever Janeway plan that didn't involve trivializing assimilation, which up until then was a much scarier consequence than this episode makes it seem.",7

Seven persuades the Captain to help those drones; in order to do this the captain, Tuvok and B'Elanna must infiltrate a Borg Cube; as the episode ends things do not look good for them and the words ""To be continued"" appear on the screen.This episode was a great end to season six which once again pitted Janeway against the Borg queen. The idea that some Borgs were connected in they dreams in a place where they were individuals but had no knowledge of it when awake was interesting and could lead to further character development for the Borg.

When Voyager finds out about this, the Captain wonders what they can do to facilitate the drones to not only live out their individual lives in the Unimatrix but extend this to their waking lives.All in all, a very creative and cool episode--as are all the Borg shows.

It turns out the holodeck has become more popular than ever since Voyager entered a strange void which will take two years to cross and in that time there will be nothing visible outside in the blackness. As they go deeper into the void crew morale is diminishing, not helped by the fact that Captain Janeway is hardly seen as she sits in her quarters mulling over the decision she made four years ago which trapped them all in the Delta Quadrant. They find a radiation source so decide to investigate; once near the source they are attacked by an unseen enemy which drains Voyager's power. Several aliens beam aboard and one is captured. Just when it looks like Voyager might be defeated another ship arrives and chases off the attackers. This ship is the source of the radiation that was detected earlier. When Janeway hears his offer of help by showing them the whereabouts of a vortex out of the void she is left with a problem; taking the help would shave two years off their journey but their assistant is dumping radioactive waste that is killing the natives of the void. Wanting to help her crew and the local aliens she comes up with a plan to stay behind and destroy the vortex after Voyager enters it however the crew refuse to leave her behind come up with an alternate plan.This episode was a good start to the fifth series; the environmental message that wasn't too heavy handed.

It's the first time I felt a genuine sense of fondness for her. I thought this episode was a great beginning for Season Five. Yes, there were a few holes in the script-writing, but nothing worth mentioning, in my opinion. Unlike most Trekkies out there, I'm only now getting around to watching the Voyager series (on Amazon Prime). The writing for the series got dramatically better with the beginning of Season Four.

Over night something strange happens; Borg tubules come out of the emitter and begins to assimilate the work station, when a crew member comes in he is attacked and a DNA sample is taken. Seven senses a Borg presence on and when they go to the lab they find a Borg Drone is growing; this isn't any ordinary drone though as it incorporates the 29th Century technology from the Doctor's emitter. Seven suggests that it might be wise to Terminate him but Captain Janeway says they will not harm him unless he proves to be a direct threat. He seems harmless as he is just keen to learn more and more. However things go wrong while he is regenerating and he automatically signals the Borg, the closest sphere is sent at high speed to intercept Voyager, bring the new drone in to the collective and assimilate the rest of the crew. As the sphere closes into attack the crew must trust the new drone to save them.This was a good episode where we get to see that when given a choice Seven is determined to stay with Voyager rather than rejoining the Borg Collective.

4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Drone (TV Episode 1998)",one of the best voyager storylines,"I have found watching episodes of TNG, VOG, and ENT to have similar episodes, rewitten for each series particular storyline. I can see where some might see this ep as similar to TNH 3:16 ""the offspring"" but I find it closer to TNG 5:23 ""i, borg"". I dont have any issues with the writers doing this. there are several eps of TNG that are similar to OS.In this case, ONE uses his advanced technology and his desire to connect to the borg collective, to help voyager. the writers do an excellent job of making ONE very endearing in a short period of time (similar to HUE in TNG). this ep shows another way seven is becoming more human in that she feels maternal protection towards ONE. in the end, seven had to let ONE make his own decision. afterall, thats how she ""raised"" him to think... as an individual.janeway, like picard, find destroying this new, individual lifeform a difficult task which makes sense. shes an explorer and for the most part, refuses to destroy sentient life until it becomes a danger to voyager. what i find contradicting is her refusal to see the danger in allowing ONE to become an adult drone but had no problem destroying a molecule considered to be ""perfect"" by seven and another alien race solely bc starfleet and the federation didnt know how to stabilize it. by that standard, she should have distroyed the drone.",8

0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Extreme Risk (TV Episode 1998)",:Self destruction:,"I don't get at all why this episode has such a relatively low rating, not that it really means anything. I think how much you enjoy character-centric episodes such as this depends on how much you care for the character in question, and I get quite a lot out of this one. It's quite a distinct entry for the series, due to the deep emotional themes of self-harm involved. Although a lot of the time I think her character can come off as a little cold, I thought Roxann Dawson gave a pretty amazing performance here. She had a knack for reaching emotional extremes that I think would have left any other cast members looking over the top and amateurish. There's just know no way I could see any other regular going to such an intense dark place and portraying the emotions-or lack thereof-so convincingly or honestly. I've seen tons of stuff over the years and I can honestly say this is one of the best portrayals of this kind of damaging behaviour I've ever seen. She's so excellent in several powerfully tense scenes where she's completely freezing out any attempts to get through to her and completely avoiding having to confront and deal with anything with this, invisible wall of cold distance. You may not see it, but this atmosphere is very palpable, it's written on the wall, written right on her forehead! I find her calm sullen detachment far more disturbing than any screaming melodrama. To better understand this story you've really had to have seen a specific scene in the season 4 episode ""Hunters"" in which B'elanna receives some very bad news from Chakotay. It's true that they don't exactly give a strong build up to B'ellana's problems here, nor do they touch upon them all that much later. But it's not as if they can focus on her this much every single time-we don't know what's going on with her in between the shows. Perhaps in such cases we should just fill in the blanks for ourselves a little, maybe? Just a thought. I also actually like Chakotay a lot in this which was a surprise, as I usually find the man to be very bland and unimpressive as a character, although he does have his place. I like him in the capacity of his trying to aid B'elanna. I like the way he forces her to reveal what's wrong. The two of them have a certain chemistry that only ever comes up in the rare scenes when it's just the two of them. I do ""buy"" him as her old friend and comrade. There's another of the weird sporadic appearances of ensign Vorik. Why didn't they ever make him a fully-fledged character? I thought he was much more interesting and likable than the pathetic Garrett Wang. Guess there was just room enough on Voyager for only one vulcan, hmm? I just loved Alexander Enberg, he was the sexiest little thing! There's also something of a secondary plot with the crew racing against the clock to beat the greasy Malons to retrieve a ""probe"" from a gas giant, but all that part is just really lame and thoroughly unengaging. Everything culminates in Torres saving the day with this hastily made phaser forcefield thingy, which I also found rushed and tacked-on. I believe those who believe the final scene indicates that all of B'ellana's issues have been wrapped-up and resolved in the span of one episode with a quick fix banana-pancake happy ending are mistaken. That is not the case at all, it's merely a turning point and step in the right direction for her, a little light beginning to shine through, as they say. I grant you it is a bit schmaltzy, but I love it, I think it's a most sweet and uplifting moment. It worked for me. It's a bit of a quaint simple kind of episode, everything plot-wise that's nothing to do with B'Elanna's plight feels superfluous and thin-but whatever, to me it's still a great character driven episode with a brilliant B'Elanna Torres story at its core.

He discovers on what seems like no more than pure intuition (again, possibly Spirit Guide Intervention) she's getting a little too reckless in her holodeck fun, and ties it all back to a message he told her some weeks back about the passing of some Maquis friends. That's sent B'Elanna into an inexplicable tizzy because she claims she couldn't feel anything about it. She confesses that she's been pushing the limits of her holodeck fantasies to see if she can still feel. Oh, she's just so cold. At what point did B'Elanna suddenly become an angst riddled teenager? She might as well put on black eyeliner, listen to The Cure, and just start cutting herself. I picture her back in her quarters, jamming out to Nine Inch Nails. B'Elanna hurt herself today to see if she still feels.Chakotay gets her mind right, and with a little peptalk, she's ready to play Wesley Crusher style deus ex machina and save the day for all in Greased Lightnin'. Paris' chills are multiplyin', you can imagine when Torres decides it's time to really let herself go, and gorges herself on banana pancakes.",4

One, she has slipped into lethargy and is not exhibiting her usual feistiness. Secondly, she is engaging in dangerous activities, shutting off the limitations of the holodeck. She refuses to tell anyone what is going on until Chakotay gets tough with her. Meanwhile, Tom is working with the other engineering types, trying to upgrade a shuttle system that has become stagnant. This is important because the intergalactic garbage men have grabbed a Voyager probe. Anyway, it just seems a bit disjointed and has a completely predictable ending.",6
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" In the Flesh (TV Episode 1998)",Really good even though the resolution came amazingly easily.,"In the two-part episode ""Scorpion"", Captain Janeway foolishly aligned Voyager with the Borg. This seemed insane at the time and now a little over a season later, the implications of this insane decision have come back to haunt them. Voyager has picked up some transmissions in the Delta Quadrant that SOUND like they are Starfleet but cannot be. When Tuvok and Chakotay beam down to investigate, they find a copy of Starfleet! It looks awfully exact and they plan to go back to Voyager to tell the Captain. However, they are discovered in an off-limits area and a guard tries to capture them--so they disable the guy and beam back to the ship. There they realize that he's actually species 8472--a rather frightening looking being who has somehow assumed human form. Why have these guys created their copy of Starfleet headquarters? Well, it's obvious because after their encounter with Voyager, they feel at risk and this could be the prelude to an attack. How can they resolve all this paranoia and preparations for war--especially since Voyager stoked these fires.This is a very fascinating episode and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My only complaint, and I mention it in the summary, is that all this paranoia sure seems to work itself out awfully easily. Still, a dandy show.",9
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" In the Flesh (TV Episode 1998)",The episode where species 8472 are humanised and tamed,"This episode serves one purpose. It's clear that by the introduction of Species 8472 an enemy worse than the Borg was introduced. I can understand this may have been seen as a mistake, but this episode so blatantly tries (and succeeds) to reverse their threat and utterly tame Species 8472, turning them from the villain that could defeat the bad Borg into potential best friends with the Federation, and humanising them in the process through their shape shifting abilities. By making them look and act human, they become less threatening after all.It is like (and I suspect probably was the case), someone said ""we can't have an enemy who can defeat the Borg. Write an episode that makes them harmless and we can be rid of them"".It's a shame as the episode is not half bad. It starts off well with the mystery of an alien species recreating Earth with the potential for an invasion (though like so much of Voyager, a rehash of earlier Trek, especially Deep Space Nine's Dominion shape shifting infiltration of Earth).It disappoints though with no real action, a diplomatic discussion that's all rather too easy and ends with them all effectively shaking hands and that's the end of the threat. The Borg are thus returned to number one evil status. It does the job intended but has spoilt a potentially good truly alien species. Non humanoid species in Star Trek are a rarity (and perhaps a little against the rules), but it's a breath of fresh air to see them, and one that truly could be evil. Perhaps it could have been taken further to develop them as a race to trust with caution and have a kind of Cold War scenario. Although the Klingons before them served that purpose and even the Romulans.Certainly not a terrible episode, but one that frustrates me for what it achieves rather than the content.",6

The Voyager Clichés. This one is full of them.First off, for a series that based itself on flinging the ship 70,000 light years away from ANYTHING previously known with the enticement of discovering ""strange new worlds and seek out new civilizations"", once AGAIN, we end up back with familiar characters and locations. Just plain lazy. The first shots open and we're back in that mysterious, mystical, 70,000 light year away location. San Francisco! What, what? Well, I guess nothing sets a genuine Star Trek puppy to tail wagging than a breathtaking look at Star Fleet Command.Once again Voyager starts the episode somewhere in the middle of the narrative, leaving you to figure out what the hell is happening. San Francisco? Chakotay? That's funny, because I THOUGHT WE WERE 70,000 LIGHT YEARS AWAY?? Kind of a lazy way to surprise the viewer, because you're basically cheesing out and only giving them a portion of the information. Now, while this basically can work once and still make for a good episode, they use it in Voyager more than Neelix uses some unheard of Delta Quadrant makeshift ingredient to make an ordinary dish even less palatable.Love? Exciting and new? Well, you've got to have a love interest! And why not employ the least passionate character and force passion on him. Again. Yup, our calm, cool, spiritual Mexican Elvis gets the ""girl"" once again, using that wooden gaze and cement tongue to land himself a Delta Quadrant faux hottie MILF. Which leads to another popular Star Trek gag. Got to have someone make out with someone that really isn't human, only pretending, so we have that underlying ""creepout factor"". Tongue you some alien species, dude! Soon we discover it's not Star Fleet Headquarters at all but a war game simulation by Species 8472. You remember those fun cats? Kicking Borg ass from some liquefied dimension, vowing to eradicate inferior species from the Galaxy? A race so flipping frightening and all powerful, even the Aryan Borg wet their pants, and sucked up to Janeway and the SS Minnow to bail their cybernetic asses out. Even though Skipper Janeway sent them packing with a mean cocktail of Borg nano-babble (and no one thought to ask how the Aryan Borg didn't think of THAT one), 8472 figured it was time to infiltrate Starfleet. Apparently, in their exhaustive search on everything there is about Starfleet, someone must have watched Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers and felt inspired.But wait! It's all just misunderstanding! The Skipper isn't a war monger! These aren't xenophobic inter-dimension dwellers eradicating the inferior! Even over the two dimensional protests of one of the ""Admirals"", both species apologize and play nice. To highlight part of this ridiculousness, not but a few scenes before Janeway was warned dozens of similar simulations scattered throughout the quadrant implying these fellas mean business. But, hey, wait, perhaps we should be reasonable? Oh, sounds great to me! Faster than a teenage klatch of bitchy young girls making up and once again becoming BFFs, we've arrived at our mutual admiration conclusion. It's another beautiful day in faux San Francisco! Ultimately as a viewer I feel cheated. They start the episode in the middle of the plot, and before you now it, it's neatly wrapped up in a little bow, sun shining, birds singing, everything right in the Delta Quadrant, and I'm thinking ""where the hell did this episode go?"" Nowhere.",4

Problem is, who is he really dating?Chakotay and Tuvix are accosted by an overly eager ensign on the way back to the beam-in point and they have to kidnap the poor sap.But when questioned by Voyeur crew, he self-destructs. ""Dr Hologram"" tweaks his DNA and out pops Species 857-6309.So, what the devil are they doing out there in the Delta Quadrant?But Quasi-Boothby is just as curious of Chakotay as Chakotay is of this Fakademy, so he sets up a trap for him, when Archer smooches with him, she steals some of his DNA and confirms ""Actual Hooman"". So they trap Chakotay and make potshots at the Delta Flyer and chase it away.Quasi-Boothby or real Boothby, only Ray Walston could ever pull it off. And Species 857-6309 had done their job too well, they had actually copied his personality. ""Targ Manure!""Even if this is a dupe of the real Boothby, he's got all of his memories and acerbic personality, so it was fitting that he be the one to conduct ""Second-Contact"" with Voyager- As ""First Contact"" didn't go too well for them.Tucker Smallwood is Admiral Bullock, or is it all (Another word that rhymes with Bullock)? Smallwood is Boothby's right hand... Whatever-they- call-themselves. Species 857-6309 never got a name. Or do they even have hands?At any rate it was a satisfying, for me at least conclusion of the Species 857-6309 saga.They had made themselves too Human, and because of this I can suspend any disbelief. They were after all going to Infiltrate Starfleet with these whatever they were, clones, copies. There was no need to explain just how they did it anyway, that wasn't the point. Also, some dolts completely forget that 70,000 (Actually, about 60,000) light years means nothing to a species from Fluidic Space.Janeway is of course the first one to take her finger off the trigger.But in all of this, they got one detail wrong: We know from Deep Space Nine, that Starfleet used the Next Generation uniforms. The Cadet's uniforms were very similar to the Voyeur uniforms, but in every place other than Deep Space Nine, they went back to the regular Next Gen uniforms at least until the First Contact uniforms came out.",10

As he is having a drink at the bar it becomes apparent that something isn't quite right when one of the other officers starts to change appearance and the woman he is talking to talks of feeling strange in that form and breathing oxygen... clearly there is something more going on the a holodeck program. Later as Chakoay and Tuvok they are confronted for being in the wrong area and are forced to beam back to voyager along with their would be captor. Here their captor commits suicide and an examination shows that he was actually Species 8472 and had been altered at a cellular level to look human. In order to find out more Chakotay returns to what we now know is a simulation of The Academy to go on a date with the woman from the bar. While talking to her he learns that it is a training facility to prepare Species 8472 for an attack on the Earth which they believe must be preparing to attack them due to previous encounters with Voyager. As Voyager prepares to attack the facility Chakotay is captured and during questioning comes to the conclusion that Species 8472 is only preparing to attack because they feel threatened, the question is can a diplomatic solution be found before conflict begins? After previous encounters with Species 8472 it is surprising just how little action there was in this episode; it was an almost entirely character driven story where distrust was overcome by discussions and the avoidance of violence, that's not to say it was a bad episode, it just wasn't that memorable either.",7

They are interested in the plans of this group, the one they attacked several episodes previously. Ray Walston appears as the leader of this species.

Neelix hopes to keep her occupied, sparing her the worry and pain of thinking she may never see her mother again.A neat element of this episode is the holideck program for children. In the 24th century instead of watching Elmo and Big Bird kids actually get to play with Flotter & Trevis. The adventures involve an educational element to encourage learning. But Sesame Street has better songs.Guest Cast: Under Flotter's makeup is Wallace Langham of CSI and The Larry Sanders Show.

As her mother is on an away mission she is being looked after by her godfather, Neelix. When contact is lost with her mother's shuttle Neelix doesn't want to tell her as he thinks it will just worry her, he believes it is best to wait until the fate of the shuttle crew is known before saying anything to her. Unfortunately Naomi discovers that her mother is missing and that Neelix knew so retreats to the holodeck. Neelix must now explain to her why he covered up the truth and was trying to protect her from bad news similar to that which he had to endure when he was younger. While this is going on aboard ship another away team is racing against the clock to find the missing shuttle before the oxygen runs out.This was a pretty good episode which concentrated on a realistic subject; just how do you give bad news to a child and what is the right time to do it? As well as a good performance from Scarlett Pomers as Naomi, Nancy Hower does well in the smaller role of her mother Ensign San Wildman.",8

Naturally, you KNOW that the last two must survive but whether Ensign Wildman will is uncertain-- especially since she's been injured when the shuttle crashed.You know that the episode cannot be that good when the big conflict is whether or not Neelix has the guts to tell cute little spiky foreheaded Naomi that her mother is lost. That and the annoying children's book characters make this one a bit tough to take at times. Definitely one of the lesser episodes of season 5--and a bit embarrassing to watch.",3
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Once Upon a Time (TV Episode 1998)",Typical Voyager,"Playing with guaranteed schmuck-bait for fan appeal by using little girls and the potential of losing one's parents, Voyager churns out an episode that, if you get past the empathic points, leaves you asking ""What was the point of this episode?"" Maybe there's something wrong with me, but I felt that this episode accomplished nothing, and ALMOST reached a level of thematic importance, but in typical Voyager fashion, chickened out at the last moment and hit the Magic Reset Button.The story is that the Delta Flyer (no idea where this thing came from, and I've watched every single episode leading up to this one), containing Samantha Wildman, Tuvok, and Tom Paris, crashlands on some rock in space near an ion storm or whatever. They lose contact with Voyager and there are suspicions they could be dead.The majority of the story involves Naomi Wildman, now five years old after a nearly 2 year pregnancy (don't ask, that is EXACTLY how it went in the series without any explanation), plays around in a holodeck novel fantasy which I seriously cannot believe is in any way written to be more than ""A weird-looking forest, with a treebark man and a water man who bicker and argue at each other"" NOTHING happens in this holodeck thing which she seems so attracted to. She just talks to a man in a bad costume of blue supposed to be water, and a man in a bad costume of what is supposed to be tree bark, and some of the worst puns ever.So the issue comes into play where Neelix, her godfather, must try to open up to her and tell her that her mother may be dead, but he keeps it quiet, even to a point of Captain Janeway urging him and getting yelled at by him in turn.But after sneaking onto the bridge, she discovers that her mother is likely dead, and flees into her holodeck. Neelix must go after her, and opens up to her about how he was around her age when his parents and siblings died and how he had to learn to accept this and such.Meanwhile, in the shuttle, nothing happens. Then towards the end, they record farewell messages to their loved ones.At this point, if Samantha Wildman died, even if Tom and Tuvok survived, the episode could have served some purpose. But this being Voyager, and even her being a minor character, she does not die, and returns to Naomi for a happy reunion, and no one learns a damn thing, ""Voyager""-style.Honestly, I was almost taken in by the whole child must learn to deal with the reality that she may end up losing her parent, but there was none of that in this episode. There was no resonance with that theme, and no one had the acting strength to properly convey this except, ironically, Ethan Phillips as Neelix. He was the strongest character in the whole story, yet he was working completely against the torrent of mediocrity and abject stupidity and pointlessness that this episode was hurling in huge doses.",1

What the hell is this crap? Of course, then the ""real"" plot begins to develop. Mom is in mortal peril as the Delta Flyer has crashed due to an inconvenient ion storm while on a mission that frankly is never even explained, and, well, shucks. How do we tell this mysteriously appearing little tyke mommy might just buy the farm? I mean, if mommy was wearing a Red Shirt, you'd think the little girl would get the hint, but, seeing as SHE'S NEVER BEEN ON THE SHOW DESPITE BEING 6 YEARS OLD, I guess she doesn't know about the abysmal track record of Red Shirted Starfleet crewman.If I can find anything positive to say about this, Ethan Phillips actually manages to turn in a fine performance amidst this hokey melodrama. But, trust me, it's not really worth suffering through the episode to ""enjoy"" it. Besides, then you'd have to be subjected to our holodeck ""Friends of Dorothy"" Romper Room portrayals. So, between the handwringing navel gazing of how to explain Mommy is a goner and the Nick Jr. holodeck Les Cages Aux Folles, you're basically just praying that power will fail and shut off your TV, so you don't even have to expend the energy of reaching for the remote to skip this worthless turd of an episode.

In the future scenes we see Harry, Chakotay and Chakotay's lover Tessa go to the long crashed Voyager and retrieve the Doctor and Seven of Nine's body. It turns out the need the Doctor to access Seven's Borg implants so they can determine the exact moment to send the message to.

In the present scenes we learn that Voyager has been equipped with a slipstream drive but there is a slight fault so the Flier must go ahead of them to send back information to correct the problem.Garrett Wang gets a chance to show a greater acting range than he usually does as Harry Kim; fifteen years of feeling guilty for Voyager's loss has had a noticeable effect on the character.

I asked him what his favorite episode of Voyager was during the Q&A, and he responded with a list of several episodes. But the one at the top of that list was Timeless.While this could have been another cookie-cutter Voyager flashback, the episode elevates itself above and beyond the other episodes by focusing almost exclusively on Harry Kim, which was a nice change of pace. I never had really latched onto Harry as a character, but this episode changed my mind for good. Garrett Wang's acting was the strongest it had ever been in this episode, and I was sold on his obsession with fixing the past. He goes through a gamut of emotions and never goes for the melodramatic.The visual effects are the best Voyager ever accomplished. Watch Voyager's crash sequence and try to tell me you weren't wincing, or that you didn't break out in goosebumps. It was heartrending, and the only other time I have come close to tears watching a beloved spacecraft crash was the death of Serenity in the move of the same name.Tape it, watch it at a friend's house, buy the fracking DVD set (the rest of Season 5 are stand-out episodes, by the way), and enjoy.

I'm not going to give anything away, but by the end of the episode, the depth and intrigue that was brought to his character is gone, but for one episode Harry Kim did come alive for me. This episode takes place in the future, when Harry and Chakotay have gotten back to Earth. The only problem is that 15 years earlier, Harry makes a mistake during the flight of their new, faster ""slipstream drive"" that would take them all the way home.

But, we need it for science fiction, so let's give it a pass. The one issue that bothered me here is that the cause of all the problems is a blind trust in Harry Kim, knucklehead at large. They had run 20 simulations and each had ended in problems. Enter the impatient Kim, and a little speech allows him and his friend Tom to go off into the ethos with no regard for testing.

Fifteen years later, the two men attempt to alter history to save the ship before Starfleet can stop them.No stranger to Star Trek LeVar Burton directs an excellent time travel episode opening with some great shots of Voyager buried in ice, a few visuals invoke The Thing (1982). What's distinct about this episode is that the characters are not over aged, the make-up is subtle with 15 years of passing on Chakotay and Harry. In addition, interestingly the cameo from Star Trek The Next Generation's USS Enterprise-E Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), as Captain of the USS Challenger isn't integral to the plot. Unlike many cameo's that usual play a pivotal role – Forge's special appearance is a throw away, which works in its favour - making it less predictable. Following on from that there's also an introduction to another passing character Tessa Omond, Chakotay's lover.It's a pacey exciting episode that doesn't over spoon-feed. It's well scripted, adding to its credibility is that there's no actual time travel per-say, yes we see an alternative time-line but cleverly there's only a message sent through time. Memorably, with some nice effects, as well as seeing Voyager under tens of meters of ice, later we see it plunging out of space, down through the atmosphere skimming mountain peaks of snow then crashing. There's good use of the ship's holodeck where they run simulations foreshadowing the inevitable crash. Refreshingly the viewer is left in the dark with writers Rick Berman, Brannon Braga & Joe Menosky offering twists and turns, seeing the frozen ship's interior, the dead crew is a interesting, as well as visually gratifying. While the regular cast do appear in segments for the most part Timeless has a limited amount of characters, it mainly revolves around Chakotay (Robert Beltran), Harry Kim (Garrett Wang), The Doctor(Robert Picardo) and Lieutenant Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill ) who all get to shine here. In addition, Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) plays an integral part albeit the utilisation of her parts.It all gets tied up nicely, even if lacking some input from the Doctor or Seven.

However, I am in the distinct minority, as the show currently has an overall rating of 8.7.When the show begins, the crew is celebrating that they're about to try out their new slipstream drive--which will allow them to get home very quickly. However, the revelry is cut a bit short when Paris thinks the calculations might be wrong and the ship is heading to disaster. You know that this WILL happen, because in the prologue, 15 year older Harry Kim and Chakotay find the ship buried in ice on a desolate planet. However, Harry is a real know-it-all and insists that he CAN fix the problem and he convinces the Captain to use the drive. This leads to the accident that causes the ship to get stuck in ice.In the future, Kim and Chakotay were able to use the slipstream to get back home. However, Starfleet does not approve of their plan to use a Borg temporal device to try to change time and bring back the crew-- so the pair steal the device and set out for Voyager and are pursued by Captain LaForge.This is a decent episode but as I said I guess I was hoping for something magical, such as ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" and their ""Troubles and Tribble-ations""--one of the best episodes of ANY Trek series.",7

It was a beautifully written story,centering on the trials and tribulations of Seven of Nine as she grappled with an invasion of multiple personalities that threatened to actually destroy her, and Jeri Ryan turned in a real tour de force of a performance. And when that doctor, who has a tendency to shoot off his mouth too much, was unsuccessful in his attempts to remedy the situation he had to step back and let the Vulcan, Tuvok, have a go at it---and Tuvok performed a dramatic Vulcan mind-fusion (very much like the one Spock used in ""The Paradise Syndrome"", by the way) as he joined Seven in successfully driving off the invaders. Electrifying, to say the least---but then I have always thoroughly enjoyed any and all mind-meld sequences in Trek. An additional comment: Someone once asked why Tuvok needed two hours to prepare. Answer: he needed that extra time because he knew what he was going up against, what he had to do if he were going to rescue Seven of Nine from the life-threatening predicament she was in. He was going all-out with the most powerful and most stressful of all the mind-melds---the Vulcan mind-fusion. He knew it was going to be a very rough ride, and indeed it was---but he had help from B'Elanna Torres in engineering who worked to destroy that Borg machine. Once it was gone, he was able to join his mind with Seven's in a full meld and pull her out of that mess. And after a wnek or so of recuperation in her regeneration chamber she was herself again.",10

Suddenly, she begins switching from one personality to another. In between she's normal (or as normal as Seven can be) but it sure is becoming annoying! What's causing this mental breakdown and what can fix it? The Doctor thinks it's caused by a bad case of the Ankaran Flu. However, the know-it-all Doctor soon seems incapable of curing Seven so he calls in a specialist, 'Dr.' Tuvok.Whether this is a good or bad episode, it must have been a challenge and rather fun for Jeri Ryan to act in this show. Her Seven of Nine is a wild emotional roller-coaster and she sure gets a chance to emote and show her stuff! This show is okay and worth seeing. The Captain's behavior through the show, however, is odd (as often is the case) and seems to make little sense in light of the power and evil of the Borg. I cannot imagine any real person doing anything to disrupt the aliens from their plan. Yet another case where she acts more like a person reading a script than someone you can believe will exist in the 24th century.

There is some of the usual tenuous science (or lack of it), but it is entertaining. We get to see Seven begin to appreciate the efforts of the crew, putting their own lives on the line.

0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Nothing Human (TV Episode 1998)",They missed the point...,"This episode attempted to present an interesting ethical dilemma revolving around the use of scientific research discovered through immoral methods...but it kind of missed the boat. They merely introduced a character with an immoral past and posed the question whether or not this person can be utilized ethically today in a new, unrelated situation. The true ethical dilemma for others (i.e. humanity) does not revolve around whether or not a particular *researcher* is an ethical person, but whether or not the *research* being utilized was gathered in an ethical way. A researcher might be a raging psychopath but being immoral doesn't automatically make everything they might do in life immoral simply through association.** SPOILERS ** If B'Elanna could have only be saved by using the exact vaccine developed through the immoral experimentation done on Bajorans (the reason given for why the Cardassian was unethical), or perhaps by another new vaccine developed by this Cardassian, then the proper moral quandary that Tuvok raises in this episode would have been properly posed. However, B'Elanna's situation had nothing to do with viruses at all. Instead, her situation depended entirely upon a different scientific discipline (i.e. exobiology vs. virology) that this Cardassian happened to also be an ""expert"" in. One might rightfully use this Cardassian's past as a good reason why he shouldn't be allowed anywhere near patients, for example, or to ever work on immunological research, but there isn't much of an ethical reasons to stop such a person from doing new research on new problems in other fields, especially when under the proper ethical guidelines and supervision a person would have on board Voyager. Moreover, given the fact that this plot depended upon a hologram with ethical issues, a slight rewrite in his ""personality subroutines"" (and perhaps changing his appearance too -- so he didn't appear Cardassian) -- things easily done in other episodes -- would have solved all of the moral issues raised in this episode in a matter of a minute or two. ** END SPOILERS ***Its not a bad episode to watch if you don't think about it much. But the writers simply missed presenting any real moral conundrum here and ended up with no more than a Chicken Little / ""The Sky is Falling"" dilemma fabricated by simply making the characters over-react to a non-dilemma instead.",4
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Nothing Human (TV Episode 1998)","Good Star Trek concept, poor implementation","The basic premise of this episode is simple: is it moral to treat an individual for a disease when the cure was acquired through immoral means? From Nazi experimentation on the Jews to modern day embryotic stem cell research, this is an important real-world topic and is perfect territory for Star Trek to explore. Unfortunately, the Star Trek nerd in me hates this episode as a Voyager episode but thinks it would have worked great on Star Trek: Deep Space 9 (DS9).In a nutshell, the crew encounters an injured member of insect-like alien race that attaches itself to Torres to sustain its life. The doctor (an Emergency Holographic Doctor: EMH) cannot figure out how to safely remove the organism so he creates a new holographic doctor from a portion of the ship's medical database that's not part of his own to assist. Unfortunately this doctor was based off a real Cardassian doctor that used cruel methods to acquire his research. Torres says she'd rather die than be assisted by this man and the audience is then treated to the controversy surrounding all sides of this situation.First; the (sometimes nerdy) reasons why I think this was a bad Voyager episode: 1) The doctor is software. He shouldn't need to create another doctor to analyze this data. He should be able to read it in the same way Microsoft Word can read any word document I give it.2) A few episodes ago the doctor was sent away so Paris and Kim attempt to create a backup doctor. This proves impossible. Then in this episode the Doctor and Kim quickly create a brand new EMH. And it was just a bit too easy to create this doctor and his personality.3) We see Bajorian crew members (a race serious oppressed by the Cardassians) but I don't remember seeing any Bajorians on the ship before or after this episode. How convenient! 4) Torres would rather die than be treated by this Cardassian recreation or his research. While I don't doubt her convictions, this position would sound more plausible coming from an actual Bajorian than a Human-Klingon hybrid.Second: Why I believe this would have made a better episode for DS9: 1) The DS9 doctor is human. Genetically enhanced, but human nonetheless. Therefore it would be believable for him to not know or not be able to assimilate Cardassian research. Being close to Cardassian space he could easily get the Cardassian in question or a protégé.2) DS9 had an actual Bajorian (Kira) in its main cast. It would have seemed more natural for this Bajorian individual to be adamant against using this Cardassian research than Voyager's Torres. Bajorans popped up on that show all the time so their opinions would have seemed natural and not a convenient plot device.3) I was nerdy enough to check the dates and this show was dated about a year after DS9's Kira gave birth to a human couple's child. If the concept of this show existed at that time, a DS9 version could have exploited that for further drama. With Kira being pregnant you immediately add more sides to the story. With the child not being hers you have a situation where the actual parents can cause additional friction. Oh well.So I disliked how it was shoehorned into Voyager and cannot watch this episode without thinking it belonged on DS9.",4
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Nothing Human (TV Episode 1998)",I don't quite understand the moral quandary,"Lt. Torres is attacked by a giant green slug-like creature. It sends its tendrils into her body and they are inextricably linked-- so much so that the Doctor cannot remove the creature without killing B'Elanna. However, some Cardassian doctor has done some research and his work might help them remove the creature. So, the Doctor has a holographic Dr. Moset consult with him. However, apparently Moset is some sort of Cardassian war criminal and Maquis members on the crew and Tuvok object to the Doctor consulting with the Moset hologram.I didn't really understand why this was such a HUGE problem. Had the ship brought the real Dr. Moset aboard to treat B'Elanna, I could easily understand the concerns. Heck, in this case I'd even like it if they shot him in the face. But it's NOT this man--it's a hologram. Despite this, the episode is moderately interesting and it is worth seeing.",6
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Nothing Human (TV Episode 1998)",Mengele moral quam...,"So I started re-watching my Star Trek Voyager series. I watched the episode entitled ""Nothing Human"" with that great character actor David Clennon (Palmer from 1982's The Thing) playing the role of a Cardassian ""hologram"" thinly veiled version of Nazi SS officer ""Dr. Joseph Mengele"" who in this show was responsible for tortuous experiments resulting in the deaths of thousands of Bajorans. Now the drama of the show is that Torres is on deaths door and the only way to help her is to use the knowledge obtained from the ""real"" Doctor's past experiments to save her life. Now the writer's take on the subject was that it was immoral to use the info obtained from those ""horrific"" experiments and to delete the program instead of using the Dr. and his knowledge in the future. Ok. So that's what they did on the show and they pushed that agenda very heavily towards non-use.
My 2 cents.... I get that they wanted to disassociate themselves with a Nazi-like Doctor working in the sick bay on the ship. But... he is only a hologram version and not the real Dr. that committed the actual crimes. The hologram version wants to use the ""tainted"" info from the past crimes to help future patients. ""If"" I were one of those victims, I wouldn't want my death to be in vain and I would want the info gained from those horrific experiments (on myself and others) to be used to help others in the future. Keep the hologram on board and turn a negative into a positive. That's my own opinion. But the politically correct card was used and the Bogey man was put back into the bottle per say. Something that Spock might not agree with on a logical level.",9
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Nothing Human (TV Episode 1998)",Badly handled ethical dilemma,"In this episode Voyager attempts to address whether it is ethical to utilize medical knowledge obtained by unethical means. However, they fail to properly address the point that much of our medical research has been developed by methods that would be considered unethical in their 24th century society. When the point is made that most of our medical research has been obtained through the use of animals against their will, they merely counter with ""but not humans"". Hold on there buddy. Medical advances including the smallpox vaccine relied on what would now be considered unethical research on humans. Even more recently, the Tuskegee syphilis experiment in the United States from 1932-1972 involved the failure of medical researchers to administer penicillin to migrant workers suffering from syphilis in an attempt to study the disease. Unethical research on people isn't something that just the Nazis or Star Trek's own 24th century war criminals have done. By failing to address the issue in its actual complexity, Voyager failed to really address this ethical dilemma at all.",4
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Nothing Human (TV Episode 1998)",Not Vulcan-logic approved!,"Like the other 5 reviews of this particular episode I also had a problem with it. When a series runs for 7 years it is impossible to have them all great, there will be peaks and valleys just like anything else in life so it is impossible not to have episodes that just don't work or fall short. I am not one to do write-ups on a lot of shows but this one episode, like the other 5 reviewers, bugged me. All the other reviews made good points, some referred to other Start Trek shows, valid points, etc. My main objection was the writers hard stance that by using the information garnered by unethical or immoral means, taints it therefore it should not be used, period. They take the victim stance to the full tilt, as they should, the whole ""lest we forget"" road which is fine BUT they didn't balance it with ""on the other hand"" approach. They greatly downplay the theme of using the sins of the father (or past generations if you like) to benefit the future or future generations. The only counter punch to the victims stance was the Cardassian Dr. Moset's hollow arguments that ""the ends justifies the means"" morality. This character was set-up to lose from the get go and only re-enforces a very unbiased point of view to support the writer(s) personal stance. There's a lot going on in this episodeprejudice, moral/ethic medical practices, war-crimes, victims' rights, even Torres being forced to have the surgery against her willetc. Lots of great stuff for effective drama. I think the episode focused too much on the facts of covered up war crimes, unethical experimenting for medical purposes AND relied too much on the huge plot hole that the hologram ""looked"" like the actual Cardassian mass murderer. Other s have pointed out the obvious plot hole in the show .. ""a slight rewrite in his ""personality subroutines"" (and perhaps changing his appearance too - - so he didn't appear Cardassian) "" I am sure having a doctor/surgeon who looks like Dr. Mengele standing over a patient in an O.R. would be a red flag situation for the best HR department in any hospital. All this stuff is great for drama BUT they did not put forth the one element that would have put more balance to all the arguments presented in the episode that favoured heavily on the side of NOT using the information to help Torres using the information gained by ""evil or immoral"" actions to do some good in the end DOES NOT validate the horrific experiment as some characters even stated in the show. I will use real life analogies since the writers used real life events when writing this script. Clearly this was a Dr. Josef Mengele inspired story- line. I understand, as most normal people would, that the Nazi state was build on evil principles. No denying that. No denying that many normal people were sucked into the regimes influence that might not have done so had they been born on the other side of the world and in a different time period of history. Now my main objection to this episode was this.there was the strong point being made NOT to use the ""treatment"" on Torres based on the unethical/immoral way it was obtained in the past. Fine. Perfect dramatic hook in writing and structure. BUT there was not the counter argument made If Dr. Mengele had done inhuman experiments on say, myself, back in Auschwitz and I died because of itI would be furious if some person in the future totally removed from the event and my own death experience, even if it were my own son or granddaughter, decided that the information gathered from my death should not be used at all simply to honour my death. It would make my death in vain and NOT honour it. I would WANT my death to mean something and have the information used to save others after me regardless how it was obtained. What is done is done. I am dead. Obviously no one is advocating to do it in the present moment..that was NOT the argument of the show. Even Tuvok should have put forth that logic but he was given the opposite stance by the writers. Logic would dictate to provide all points of view and come to a conclusion based on that yet he jumped aboard the"" by using it we validate the horror"" bandwagon. The writers take a moral stance that has the Voyager Doctor erasing the Cardassian program at the end of show. This sends the message they will NOT use the medical information so as to NOT validate the information on how it was obtained. A better ending would to have left it as an unanswered dilemma. The current ending is now just a biased soap-box moment with plot holes left in by lazy writing.",9
6,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Nothing Human (TV Episode 1998)","Ah, a Cardassian. He must be a war criminal.","The episode sets a dilemma of whether it is ethical to make use of unethically conducted research, which is interesting. The truth is it handles it rather poorly, making it very easy to agree with the counterfeit Mengele counterfeit.I mean, even ignoring obvious bypasses, like ""make the cardassian look like someone else"", everyone being angry at a hologram is fairly stupid. It is also silly how the hologram argues its cardassian points efficiently, even though it is based only on data that Starfleet has, that do not justify its lack of ethics. And it is annoying how cardassians are always bad guys. Enough already.In the end, though, Cardassian defence of horrid practices is always an interesting plot - and somehow they always seem more convincing (possibly on account of how insufferable Bajorans are), despite being obviously wrong. Also, I like non-humanoid species, although the critter here barely gets any character depth.",7
7,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Nothing Human (TV Episode 1998)",A Tough Question,"I suppose morality is rather relative at times. If one is saved by not eating a poisonous mushroom whose toxic properties caused the deaths of thousands of primitive humans, should we ignore that evidence. I know there is a difference. It does not diminish the horror of those practicing those awful experiments. The Nazis were involved extensively and should never be forgiven by the families of those victimized. But perhaps the saving of the innocents is a way of diminishing the awfulness of their actions. Let's be clear. The Doctor and B'ellana have no direct connection to this monster. What if the Doctor had accessed the database and found out about a curative, rather than the hologram that appears in the holodeck. Had the ensign not recognized the evil personage. If B'Allana had not reacted to a Cardassian presence. Would it have been OK in the entirety of the cosmos to just look at it as data. If one only has a single life (as I believe) and they are willing to give it up rather than be treated, that would be their right. But to have more people die, seems like an arbitrary universe.",7
8,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Nothing Human (TV Episode 1998)",A moral Dilemma for Voyager,"When Voyager comes across a damaged alien ship a strange creature comes aboard and attaches itself to B'Elanna. It isn't immediately apparent whether this is a form of attack or if it is just trying to survive. The Doctor doesn't know how to safely remove the creature so uses the holodeck to recreate the Alpha Quadrants leading exobiologist; a Cardassian named Dr. Crell Moset. When B'Elanna sees who is going to treat her she objects as she doesn't want a Cardassian operating on her even if he is only a hologram. She isn't the only person to object; a Bajoran crew member recognises him as somebody guilty of performing medical experiments on Bajorans similar to those committed by the Nazis. This leaves the captain with a moral dilemma; does she let B'Elanna die or does she use techniques learnt through abhorrent means?This was a fairly good episode with an interesting moral dilemma even if it is somewhat surprising that Star Fleet had not been told that such a high profile medical expert was in fact a war criminal, it was also a bit of a surprise when a Bajoran crew member popped up to expose him when this crew member had never been seen before.",7
9,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Nothing Human (TV Episode 1998)",I've seen worse but this one is pretty bad.,"This episode takes a lot of illogical leaps. Remember the time they sent the doctor to the alpha quadrant and Harry and Tom tried to create a new EMH in case he never came back? They set the precedent in that episode that creating an interactive hologram with a giant database is REALLY hard. Well in this episode they just ask the computer to do it, tweak a couple things, and they've not only created an interactive database but a full-fledged Cardassian individual for the Maquis on-board to loathe. There was zero reason to recreate the guy. Seems to me they could have just dumped the same medical data into the doctor's program. In fact, that could have been far more interesting to watch Picardo struggle with the morality of what he learns from the data and whether or not to use the data to save Torres.Another issue I had was, if you can scan the creature in sick bay thoroughly enough to recreate it entirely on the holodeck with such accuracy that you can even cut the hologram open and see totally accurate internal workings of the creature, then why do you even need to perform fake surgery on the hologram? Can't you just ask the computer to simulate whatever procedure you wanted to try instead of wasting time? Clearly they have detailed scans that allow a perfect recreation of the creature's anatomy so what is the point of even recreating it?Lastly, I'm sure this could expand into a giant philosophical debate but on the surface the moral issue seems rather simple to me. By not using the data to save Torres they are making all the Bajoran Deaths that much more pointless. The fact that this data came at a great evil cost should definitely be remembered and mourned, but clearly that data was already in their database somehow and nobody seemed to care? Deleting it is just ignorant and self-righteous in my opinion because they're only doing it to make themselves feel better rather than having any positive practical effect on anything. Their moral stance of deleting the data without using it to save their crew member isn't going to stop psychopaths from doing the same evil stuff in the future and they themselves aren't the ones that are ever going to do anything so morally bankrupt. One could argue that using the research to save lives is actually the moral thing to do and pays at least some homage to those who died.",3

As Voyager nears the planet it is intercepted by ships that launched from under the surface. It turns out that it is inhabited by a species who settled there a few centuries before and are mining oxygen from its waters. They have a problem though, the ocean is slowly being lost to space.

I have been watching Voyager for the first time since I saw it first-run, my memories of these episodes don't jibe with what I am seeing now.In fact, I don't remember seeing this one, it slipped through the cracks. A friend of mine, when missing an episode of some show we were watching would always say ""I'll catch the Re-Runs this summer"" - But that doesn't happen anymore, and I don't think it was happening much during Voyager's first Run through UPN13-space.As far as this episode goes, I like the way it has been told ""In Flashback"". Tom is being properly sanctioned and demoted due to rank insubordination.This is something I would have expected to happen in the first season when he was still a bit disorderly, but in fact, his behavior from Voyager's first day in the Delta Quadrant had been exemplary.In Season Two, he took on a role of insubordination but we finally learned it was a trick to get Info from our Favourite Cardassian Mole, Seska.So that it happened here in the middle of the 5th Season was something of a surprise. I had figured he had done something completely irascible, but that is not the case.As far as ""Out of Character"" goes, Harry, innocent little Harry, has a Date with the Delaney Sisters in Tom's ""Captain Proton"" Holo-Serial. I wonder if Republic made those? Actually it's just another example of Harry picking the Wrong Girl to go Bugsputz over (again). A Dead Girl, Seven, an Alien Chick who made his skin glow, this is par for Harry's long line of infatuations. But The Delaney Sisters looked great, didn't they?Voyager finds an Ocean floating in Space, meet a race of people who have been living there. Nobody knows how it got there, until they send the Delta ""Flying Sub"" down to the core and find a huge reactor that's holding the Ocean in place, but not much is holding the reactor in place.In fact it is failing because the people who live there are ruining the ecology, so it is not a matter of 'if' the whole place will dissipate molecule by molecule, it's a matter of when this will happen, which will be soon.Tom befriends one of the scientists of this race, who shares his concern, and they conspire to blow up one of the Oxygen-Mines which is wrecking the place.Janeway, as much as she agrees, cannot interfere and has to stop him. This is a very different Tom Paris than the one we met in the Pilot Episode, that man did not care about anything, not even himself. But seeing this floating Ocean has ignited his love of all things Maritime that he had since Childhood, and he is compelled to act.Some times we just have to do things that are not strictly legit. I understand Tom's desire to preserve something wonderful that had been created long ago. But when the race of people who would ultimately benefit from this do not care one iota, it is not clear if this kind of action is warranted. But we know this is something Tom had to do, even when it meant being Demoted to Harry's Rank.So now B'Elanna can order Tom around.More than anything else, this is character development- If Tom will sacrifice his rank to benefit someone other than himself, then maybe being on Voyager has changed him irrecoverably from that guy who didn't give a veQ 'ay'",10

The Moneans are wary at first but soon warm to the Federation visitors. However, when Paris helps one of their scientists investigate why the ocean level is changing, the real problem begins--and you'll just have to see the show to see what I mean.To me, this plot seems like a way for the program to address Global Warming or Global Cooling (I cannot remember which concept was in vogue at that time). Overall, it's interesting and it's interesting that for once, someone is more sanctimonious than the Captain!",7

I don't want to give away any spoilers, but suffice it to say, he did not violate the Prime Directive. If you really think about it, you will come to the same conclusion. It was merly bending the spirit of the law. Funny fact, the Prime Directive did not even apply in this situation.Janeway's irrational and overly dramatic punishment for Tom is nothing more than another sign of her holier-than-thou mentality.
Otherwise she would have had to demote Tuvok in the first season's episode ""Prime Factors"" and put him in the brig for longer than 30 days. However, she did not, which only proves my point.Other than that I really enjoyed this episode, which develops Tom's character even further.",7

This means those crew members with a degree of telepathy must hide in the transporter system while the searches take place. Not only are four crew members hiding there are also a group of telepathic refuges. Shortly after one of the inspections Voyager is approached by a single Devore ship with just one person aboard; the chief inspector. He tells Capt. Janeway that he knows that she has telepaths on board and how she is hiding them but he isn't trying to catch them but to defect. Of course it takes a while for the captain to come to trust him but eventually it appears she believes him and accepts his help in looking for a wormhole which appears at regular intervals but not always at the same point. When the ship is spotted by a Devore scanning array the inspector says he will return to his fleet and make sure any inspection is brief... now Janeway will learn whether she was right to trust him or not.I found this to be a fairly gripping throughout and until the very end I hadn't determined whether Inspector Kashyk was genuine or just using Voyager to find the worm hole. His interest in classical music added to his character too and helped him get closer to the captain in a believable way.",8
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Counterpoint (TV Episode 1998)",A beautiful point made with counterpoint,"This is one of my favorite episodes of the series! An early scene starts off with Mahler's Symphony No. 1, a digression from the usual background music of Trek, rightly so - as it plays a key role in the unfolding story. We hear an example of ""counterpoint"": counter-melodies playing against one another. This sets the stage for the rest of the episode.Voyager is ungraciously inspected by the Devore, a xenophobic race determined to eradicate the presence of telepaths in their territory. As Voyager inevitably needs to travel through their space en route home, they reluctantly submit to inspectors, while the pompous Devore commander, Kashyk, adds insult to injury by blasting Mahler through Voyager's communication system.Breaking the Prime Directive yet following a moral compass, Voyager harbors fugitive telepaths (as well as their own telepathic crew members) in a suspended transport system. They disappear during each inspection, but cannot do this much longer due to health issues that result.Following an inspection, Commander Kashyk returns alone and requests asylum from Voyager. He's had a change of heart, as his conscience cannot further handle the totalitarian eradication of telepaths.Captain Janeway expresses great doubt at first, but her iciness gradually melts towards Kashyk as the two work intimately to find a wormhole where the telepaths can escape. As they try to solve the puzzle of locating the wormhole with Tchaikovsky playing in the background, the counterpoint of the music leads them to find the solution.As the episode later reveals, Captain Janeway and Commander Kashyk are counterpoints themselves, two leaders who play against each other - not through phasers but through wits. Their tension occurs on multiple levels: sexuality, trust, and power. In the end, Kashyk is revealed to be untrustworthy after all, so they are destined to remain rival counterpoints. However, Janeway prevails in typical form: open-hearted yet cunning, and unafraid to bite with her humor.As her victory is revealed, she has the computer play Mahler's Symphony No. 1, the same piece that Kashyk used at the beginning of the episode to display his power. Embarrassed and angry, yet with hints of softness and play, Kashyk lets the ship go and gives her the victory, saying, ""Well played, Captain.""In a series filled with blasts and boobs that are larger than life, I appreciate this more subtle battle, with captains that mix enmity with intimacy and play. The music is used in a novel way and serves as a wonderful metaphor too.The untrustworthiness of Kashyk also reflects upon the sadness of Devore culture. Unable to trust or be trusted, they see harmless telepaths as mortal enemies. The moments of Kashyk's humanity that peak through his manipulation and bombastic voice (PRAX!) give me a soft spot for the enemy. This is another nice touch to an overall enjoyable episode!",10
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Counterpoint (TV Episode 1998)",Point and Counter,"If you haven't seen this episode, then don't read this until you have.Voyager has fallen into a Dismal Routine. In traveling through ""Devore"" space they are subjected to unexpected and continuous ""inspections"" by huge Devore warships.The Devore are your typical Cardassian-Style Xenophobic race, but with this added phobia: They don't like Telepaths. So the trick is, where do you hide Tuvok, Vorick and a bunch of ""Brenari"" house-guests?The Transporter Pattern Buffers might be a good place to start. But continuous use of this trick has one unfortunate side-effect, it is killing Tuvok, Vorick and the Brenari guests.Each Time the Devore visit Voyager, their commander ""Kashyk"" (Mark Harelik, ""Dr Eric"" from ""Big Bang Theory"") beams himself into Janeway's Waiting Room and starts playing Tchaikovsky or Mahler or some other piece of music. Alongside him is his trusty Stormtrooper ""Prax"" (J. Patrick McCormack- He was the Non-Female Romulan Commander in ""Star Trek: Nemesis""). The two are a counterpoint in themselves, while Prax rigidly follows Devore protocol, Kashyk seems to be trying to be pleasant. Good cop, bad cop?The idea was for Voyager to meet a Brenali Transport vessel, but the rendezvous points keep getting changed.Then a remarkable thing happens, Kashyk shows up in a scout ship and asks asylum. claiming defection. He even knows all about Janeway hiding the Telepaths in the transporter buffer, he could have busted them previously but didn't - Does this mean he can be trusted?With his help Janeway tracks down a scientist named ""Torat"" (Randy Lowell) who is a little reluctant to help them locate an Interspatial Flexure (ie, a Wormhole). Torat does great things with his nose when he gets frustrated.Basically it's the interaction between Janeway and Kashyk that has this episode. Should this guy be trusted? I wouldn't. But Janeway seems to take him at his word, but puts Security guards on him just in case.Torat gives them a clue to find the ""Interspatial Flexure"" and between Kashyk and Janeway they figure out how to find it, and open it to escape this crappy region of space with Brenali Telepaths in tow. Kashyk even tells Janeway how to find the Devore's Cloaked Ships, and even how they do it.Unfortunately, when passing a Devore Scanning Beacon, their Warp Drive reacts, setting off the alarm. They now have 11 hours to get to where the Wormhole is supposed to show up next, before the Devore come inspecting.True to form, Kashyk makes an excuse to go back to the Warships, but he had agreed to keep up the subterfuge and make a quick inspection.This is not what happens at all when the warships arrive. For one thing, why was Prax on the Warship, unless this was all planned?Who is fooling who and how and why?In fact Kashyk plays along up to the point where Janeway reveals the location of the Flexure, and then all of his colors come back, that's what he was looking for in the first place, cos too many would be victims were escaping through it with the help of Torat.Janeway changes her tune as well as the tune Kashyk had started playing in her Waiting Room. Even while Kashyk is ""Destroying"" the wormhole, Prax opens the pattern buffers. All he finds are crates full of bananas. I sure hope Tuvok and Vorick were hiding in one of them, because nobody explains exactly where he and Vorick were during this last inspection. And all Kashyk finds where the wormhole was supposed to be is nothing at all but some antimatter particles.Needless to say, the Brenali (Not to be confused with the Brunali, the race of Icheb) escape to the Wormhole using the Devore's own cloaking tech, as well as two Voyager shuttles, a gift from Janeway.This was in fact one of the best Season 5 episodes, less emphasis was put on gimmicks and effects and more on it's relational aspects. I had to dissect it to review it, due to its complexity.What is shown here is exactly how Janeway's mind works, this is a Janeway episode pure in its form. And she's not so bad with this type of conundrum, this is what she excels at.I still want to know where Tuvok and Vorick were hiding. And I saw one more female Vulcan Crewoman in season six or seven, she's not mentioned or shown here. Tsk Tsk!",10

During this search, these people act a lot like bullies and it's obvious that they are jerks. After they leave, you learn that this race HATES telepaths and they hunt them down and put them in concentration camps. During this inspection, there were a group of these telepaths as well as some telepathic crew members (such as the Vulcans) and they hid them inside the transporter buffer. Once they were brought back, the plan was to get them to safety as soon as possible--but considering how nasty the Devore are, there are bound to be more inspections. But using the buffer repeatedly could end up killing these telepaths.The solution to their problem MIGHT have just arrived as Inspector Kashyk (the man who had led the inspection) shows up bit later and says he wants to defect. He claims that he hates how his people persecute the telepaths. Additionally, he seems to have taken a real shine to the Captain. So what's next? See the show.This is a pretty good episode. I do wish that Kashyk had become a recurring character or they'd expanded the romance more, but apart from that it's worth seeing.",7

But one of the inspectors doesn't feel that way, and when he approaches Capt. Janeway and tells her he wishes to defect the two form an alliance, however uneasy, and the two work with the Voyager crew to find a wormhole through which two families, all of whom are telepathic, can escape. (These fugitives would probably find a warm welcome on Vulcan where just about everybody has this ability.) As the story progresses we find everything, including humor---there's a scene where an army of those xenophobes overrun several decks, including Cargo Bay #1, and open up a number of crates and barrels to find---vegetables! I had a good laugh about this. Finally the problem is resolved as the two families of telepaths escape through the wormhole, and the fraidy-cat Devorans have something to think about. Incidentally---the inspector who succeeds in defecting is named Kashyk, which sounds like a variant of a Vulcan word ""kashek"", which means ""the mind""---as in the phrase ""wuh tepul t'wuh kashek"" which translates as ""the power of the mind"". I wonder if he was a closet telepath himself? Anyway, a good story---and again, a lesson to be learned.",10

The Doctor comes to believe that the crew must have had its memories of some event erased. He seeks the help of Seven of Nine but when she comes to sickbay he has no knowledge of requesting her help suggesting whoever deleted his memory is still aboard. As seven tries to retrieve his memories and pictures he took at the time which were also deleted the find images of a crew member the Doctor doesn't recognise and an alien of an unrecognised species. Fearing his memory will be deleted again he backs it up and sets his camera to take a picture of whoever enter sick bay while he is off line. When he returns his memory has been tampered with but the back up automatically reloads and he looks to see who was responsible... he is shocked to find that it was Captain Janeway. It emerges that she had his memories deleted after he had a breakdown following a medical decision which led to the death of the crew member who featured in the photographs. As he learns this the problem returns and Janeway wants to repeat the procedure although the Doctor objects, as does Seven who believes it would be hypocritical to treat him in such a way when living crew members would be helped through the problem.Robert Picardo gets an opportunity to show off a greater acting range as the Doctor starts to get understandably paranoid and break down. It also gave Kate Mulgrew an opportunity to portray her character in a slightly less favourable light than usual.

In this one, you see even more growth and change--and it all comes whether he wants it or not.Early in the show, the Doctor is very concerned as he has suddenly seen evidence that his programming has been tampered with and it occurred 18 months ago. He thinks at first that some aliens are responsible but ultimately he learns that Captain Janeway was responsible. Why would she have his programming changed? What is it from his experiences and memories that she doesn't want him to remember?

Why would it bother him so much if it was impossible to save both lives?Apart from that, the episode also explores the nature of the Doctor as well as Janeway's biases about the Doctor's nature. She may not view the Doctor as equal to organic human beings. When Seven of Nine questions her about the nature of individuality, Janeway compares the Doctor to a replicator, to a machine. Seven disagrees and says that Janeway gave him a soul.Interesting issues, but the story could have been dry if it didn't also include the element of friendship and faith in others. Seven is concerned that Janeway could abandon her in the future. Janeway struggles to decide whether the Doctor is a glorified program or an independent member of the crew, and someone with a soul who deserves the dignity and respect of all the other members of the crew.Note: The episode included less background music than usual.

This is all revealed when the doctor attempts to come up with a ""per-diagnostic"" tool, allowing him to establish a baseline health standard for every crew member. He's not shocked to learn that Harry Kim has had major surgery, or that he was the only one who could have performed it. What bothers him is his inability to remember it. In trying to run down why his memory is malfunctioning, he goes to ""Seven"" for help reconstructing what had to have been there.Janeway is a bit less than likeable in this episode. She instructs the doctor to shut down ""for his own safety,"" and then erases his memories again. As mentioned in the first paragraph, the doctor is ready to detect the intruder, and discovers that it's Janeway herself. Her motives aren't the best, but they are practical, and based on her core belief that the doctor is basically just a machine.After a number of philosophical discussions with Seven, a confession to the doctor, and the repeat of the doctor's breakdown that caused the memory erasure to begin with, Janeway and the crew decide to stay with the doctor in hopes that he can reason his way through the ethical conundrum of letting one patient die and another to live.A very well crafted piece of writing that tests ethical and emotional boundaries.",9

He saves Kim. He goes nuts over his decision, and Janeway decides to erase his memories of the event to keep him functional. But he tracks down the erasure, and is in danger of going nuts yet again as he relives the whole incident.I rate this somewhat lower than many users because the situation is a bit forced. Surely Federation programmers of the 24th century have heard of fuzzy logic? Surely Janeway would have realized to begin with that she can reprogram the Doctor any time, and it's worth giving him a chance while closely monitoring him to see if he recuperates the third time around. And the aliens who injured Kim and the ensign just appeared out of nowhere and disappeared into nowhere, a cheap deus ex machine effect.It's worth a watch, and the Doctor is always fun, but he has better episodes - and worse; worth a watch.",6

That battle is holding Voyager in a subspace riff, and it's losing power. So members of the crew dress up and ham it up in the hollodeck.It's a snappy little script, full of jokes and asides, and Janeway is particularly enjoyable as the vampy Queen Arachnia. The story is also highly self-referential, and not all viewers may enjoy that. It's a story about a story, and brings you in full consciousness that you are watching human actors pretend they're in space.

The crew of Voyager can't shut off the program so are forced to enter the program and ensure that Chaotica is defeated. To this end Captain Janeway takes the role of Arachnia, Queen of the Spider People to infiltrate Chaotica's fortress and disable his lightning shield to enable Captain Proton, Tom, to defeat his death ray.Unusually for an episode of a modern programme it was almost entirely in black and white, it also didn't fall in to the trap of taking itself too seriously but left its tongue firmly in its cheek with cod dialogue and the camp look of old serials such as ""Flash Gordon"".

But as Voyager gets pulled into a subspace quantum gravity techno-babble situation, cross dimensional beings mistake the fantasy of the holodeck for Voyager's reality, and find themselves at war with Chaotica, the Merciless, or something like that.Naturally, the only solution is to play out the holodeck fantasy to its conclusion, and the hilarity ensues.Kate Mulgrew obviously has a lot of fun throwing herself into the role of the Arachnia queen, and even the Doctor plays an amusing President of Earth.

There is supposed to be a serious subplot involving a previously unknown race of photonic aliens (REAL Star Trek stuff) but, unfortunately, this is ""lost in space"" (pun intended) as an unending barrage of sight gags and campy dialog destroy any possibility of dramatic tension or interest in the plot or characters.I'm sure that this story probably looked great on paper, and no doubt the principle actors had some fun with it, but we've seen far too many ""we can't shut the holideck down"" episodes not only in ""Voyager"" but in ST:TNG and ST:DS9 as well, and the idea has long since worn out its welcome, so lets move on already (but kudos to the production designers for some affectionate, faithful, and highly detailed ""Buck Rogers"" style costumes & sets).",4

In fact, it's way too silly for me to enjoy. So when I realized this was going to be an episode pretty much all about that I confess I didn't cheer out of joy. Although I didn't hate it as much as I thought I would. Some parts of it where actually interesting. I liked the part about the fifth dimension and the photonic beings that appeared in the holodeck, although I would have liked to known more about them and seen the crew explore more about how they live and such. As it was here we pretty much just got to know they existed and that they can't read ""real"" people as lifeforms. It was also kind of fun to see Captain Janeway agree to participate in the Captain Proton-craziness. But other than that I mostly just endured the episode and smiled awkwardly a few times.If you're not like me and want to see all the Star Trek: Voyager-episodes and also don't really like Captain Proton you might want to skip this one.",5

At first, I saw that Tom and Harry were apparently stuck in the incredibly tedious ""Captain Proton"" holodeck simulation, for yet another malfunctioning holodeck episode.So I figure it's going to be about the incredibly tedious adventures of Captain Stupid and Harry Kim, so bland and boring he doesn't get a name or stupid title.Then all of a sudden Tom and Harry are back on Voyager's bridge, without any explanation as to how they got there, having apparently got out of the holodeck.So on Voyager there is a plot involving pure technobabble. I do not know at all what the hell was going on, just technobabble and apparently getting stuck in somewhere somehow.Meanwhile, a pair of aliens dressed as sleazy 30s gangsters appear, but are from another ""dimension"" where they are all photonic lifeforms, and they cannot detect Voyager or carbon lifeforms.They then start a war on Chaotica, the bad guy in the Captain Proton thing, where their own soldiers die for real.The explanation given is that these are essentially MIRROR aliens in terms of holographics. As in, they are photonic lifeforms and view carbon lifeforms as artificial and unreal as we do holographic lifeforms.The whole idea is made more stupid by its stale, boring, generic, lackluster execution. This is probably one of the worst Voyager episodes because it's just not at that Season 2-ish level of Voyager of ""So unbelievably atrocious, you have to see it to believe it"" like ""Treshold"" or ""Tattoo"" It's just boring",1

After the opening credits we find ourselves on a standard ""California desert"" planet where we see a woman, who we later learn is called Noss, hunting large spider-like creatures; suddenly there is a flash as something hurtles through the atmosphere, when she looks to see what it is we find it was a Star Fleet runabout. She goes to it and while looking around inside is interrupted by Tom Paris. When she talks he can not understand her, either the translator is broken or can't translate her language. She takes his equipment bag but soon after leaving is attacked by two aliens, luckily Tuvok rescues her. The learn that the planet they are on is inside a gravity well which they can not escape from.

Half way through the episode action switches to Voyager where we see that only a short time has passed since the shuttle went missing. When looking for the shuttle Voyager almost gets trapped itself and is met by a alien ship which plans to seal the rift once and for all, an action which will crush everything inside. Voyager only has a few hours to figure out how to get a message through the rift and get the crew back. Tom, Tuvok and Noss have to survive alien attacks for some time before they can be rescued.This was a pretty good episode guest starring Lori Petty, she did well in the role of Noss, having some touching scenes where she developed feelings for Tuvok which he could not reciprocate.

We have the story of Tuvok, The Doctor, Tom Paris and ""Noss"" surviving on a barren rock heap, the story of Voyager trying to figure out how to get them out while under an imposed time limit, and the story of Young Tuvok going through his first ""Kolinahr"", and learning how to live with but not lose or be controlled by his emotions. And we see here, as usual ""Emotions Run Deep"" in a Vulcan Soul- But are absolutely not absent.It is not that Tuvok is not affected by Noss' (Petty) affections, but to act on them would betray not only himself but her as well.The Voyager ""Multi-Spatial Probe"" is finally put to some good use here, and allows a solution for this conundrum.In any Trek episode it is not the Technobabble solution to a dilemma that is important, but the heart of the story, which here focuses on Tuvok.And the final scene between Tuvok and Noss is a brilliant and satisfying ending to this story.

She falls in love with Tuvok, who rebukes her emotions. Through flashbacks we learn how he fell in unrequited love once as a young man, suffering all the pain, but learned to cope under the logical tutelage of a Vulcan Master.It is touching to see how she suffers the same as Tuvok did, in a mirror image of sorts. Yet through his past experience, he understands much more how she must feel than Paris gives him credit for.In the end, Voyager enables them to escape in a side story involving a stand-off with aliens of the same race as many of the marooned, who are about to close the pocket for good to avoid further loss of ships. In a poignant final scene, Tuvok helps Noss understand that he understands, and why he cannot respond to her affection.Definitely one of the better episodes of the series, with strong character development, akin to the episode 5.11 about the doctor coming to terms with having to make impossible decisions, but better.",7

Seven of Nine and Naomi Wildman have to save the day. These are 2 of my least favourite characters but there's very little sentimentality in this episode. W. Morgan Sheppard makes an interesting appearance as a friendly alien and does a good job. So what makes this episode better than average? I think its one of those episodes where the outcome comes down to one individual who can save everybody. This is not a new idea. So when all of the crew apart from Seven of Nine (who isn't desperate to get to Earth) and Wildman (isn't bothered about Earth because she wasn't born there) cannot help, it comes down to Wildman (who is the only conscious crew member at this point) to find and revive Seven of Nine and start the escape. Its also fun at the start to see Seven struggling with the crew who are duped into thinking that the worm hole is the way home. This leads to Seven erecting various force fields and shooting various crew members (not killing them). This is always a fun idea and works well.

Only two members of the crew don't seem happy with the situation are Seven of Nine, who has no desire to go to Earth and believes things are far too good to be true, and Naomi Wildman who has had no home apart from Voyager so has no wish to get to Earth. Seven asks the Doctor to investigate whether or not the crew are being manipulated but when she returns to ask how he is getting on she finds that he is off line because the crew received a message saying the wormhole might damage him. She finds that there is another ship in the wormhole and talks to its captain who warns her that it is a trap. Soon after Seven is advised that she must go into stasis as it may effect her Borg implants. She resists and with the help of young Naomi Wildman manages help Seven maintain a force field long enough for her transport to Engineering. Unfortunately Capt. Janeway finds a way to stun her and takes Voyager into what the crew believe is a worm hole but clearly is something quite different. Once inside the crew is rendered unconscious but imagines getting to Earth. Naomi is unaffected and goes to engineering to find Seven. She then activates the Doctor and contacts the alien who is also trapped; it turns out he has been hunting a huge creature for years but was tricked into thinking he could defeat it by the creature's ability to telepathically effect anybody nearby and lure them in and devour the; as Naomi says. ""like a pitcher plant catching insects"". Together they must find a way to escape before they too become food.Jeri Ryan does well taking the lead in this story as Seven and is ably supported by Scarlett Pomers as Naomi, Robert Picardo as the Doctor and guest star William Morgan Sheppard who played the Capt.

Eventually, the ship gets very close and the crew falls asleep--all but Naomi who is some freaky little kid who appears in way too many episodes.

She wants to send a team aboard a damaged Borg ship and steal its warp core. But here is where Janeway gets REALLY weird--she insists that Seven get in touch with her childhood and practically forces her to read through her idiot* father's old logs. Not surprisingly, this really messes with Seven's brain. Later, when they do attack, Seven unexpectedly rejoins the Collective--perhaps due, in part, to her PTSD and reading Daddy's log. Sure, there's a bit more to it than that...but you do wonder how much Janeway's orders led to this.This is an exciting episode.

But when Harry transports the Photon Torpedo too close to the Plasma Generator, the Borg Octagon becomes Mince-Meat.The Doc finds a great Drone Arm with Medical Attachments, lucky him, but the Prize Janeway was seeking, the Transwarp Coil, was damaged beyond repair by even 7-of-69.But the Octagon had Data Modules that contain some tactical information and ship movements so she inaugurates ""Operation Fort Knox"" so that she can swipe a coil from a damaged Sphere which is limping back to The Collective at low warp.Janeway elicits Seven's help to plan this debacle, orders Seven to read her parent's mail that they stole from the decayed remains of ""The Raven"" - The Hansen's partially assimilated and wrecked ship that they found when Seven was compelled to find it earlier. I don't know when they had time to set up a full Core Data Transfer, in ""Star Trek: Next Generation"" Geordi had to set up a Link and suck the Data up each time they did it, which was a time consuming process.We have to suspend disbelief (again) and surmise that while Seven and Tuvok were on the Raven being bombarded with Photon Torpedoes, Tom Paris was able to connect to The Raven's computer Core and suck up all the Data and Logs. Or maybe Voyager did it, in the few seconds they had before having to Haul Arse out of that sector before being chased by the paranoid aliens who lived there.Nevertheless, Voyager now has the Hansen's Full Logs of all of their endeavors while peeping at The Borg. And Seven has to go through all of this stuff to find advantages they can use to get into a Borg Vessel.The Vignettes of Life on The Raven are your typical 24th Century Family gone Borg-Hunting.

And balloons! And cute little puppy dogs! At least the nightmarish series isn't drowning in a swamp of compromised morality, blurry objectives, questionable character choices and wildly-swinging story lines. That would be bad.This episode is terrible, stretching a bad idea over two hours, almost single-handedly killing the character and reputation of Janeway while forcing Seven to suffer alone yet again in choosing between humans and the Borg. Oh, and there's a Holodeck fake-out too. You can never get enough of those.To pad out the two episode arc we are treated to multiple pointless flashbacks and forced to hear ""You will be assimilated"" and ""Resistance is futile"" about nine times each. I often wonder what this series would be like if any of the writers seemed to LIKE any of the characters... what it would be like if episodes were even-keeled with recurring, season-spanning story lines... instead our crew is punished and dehumanized yet again while all previous lessons are forgotten in favor of this week's mission.Why would Janeway risk the ship and her crew member/friend Seven for a transwarp coil only to later risk the ship in order to save the evidently expendable Seven? Even after its revealed that Seven may not want to be saved?Kate Mulgrew is wonderful as the Captain but the writers did her no justice by making her morality and priorities change with the breeze. Will this be the last time Seven's loyalty is questioned and she is forced to experience the cold fear and terror of reintegrating herself to life as a human? Let's hope so.

They search through Seven's parent's records to try to formulate a plan to find Seven and free her from the drone; this plan sees them using the stolen trans-warp drive and to a stand off between Janeway and the Borg Queen.This exciting episode saw some good acting from Jeri Ryan as Seven of Nine and Susanna Thompson as the sinister Borg Queen.

Of course, it's all about going to Earth and taking over the population, turning all earth people into drones. Seven vacillates between her humanness and her Borgness. She is, indeed, conflicted.

How these people had ended up in the Delta Quadrant was a bit of a plot hole, but now we get an answer.The Borg Queen is also a great addition, but honestly, my one complaint is we needed more of her, and more Borg lore. It was a good chance to learn how the Borg became Borg in the first place and it is wasted.Other than that, the episode is great, as the Borg always make a great adversary.Of course, there are some problems: for one, the Queen tells 7 she is the only drone to have regained individuality and that makes her unique - horse-faeces, one may point out, as the Voyager crew had discovered a whole colony of former drones who only occasionally formed their own collective (arguably the Borg were unaware of this, but it weakens the argument for the viewer). Secondly, there is so little reason for the Borg to be obsessed with destroying humans. They have already assimilated so many that whatever they had to offer to the Collective has been offered already, and by all accounts they are hardly worth such obsession - why not the Vulcans, or the Klingons? They also resisted the Borg and frankly, I doubt the Borg hold grudges and maintain vendettas out of spite.
I also don't like how the Voyager seems to now win a decade or two every episode, but I suppose they have to get back somehow.Anyway, these are complaints formed by overthinking the episode - which should be a clue that it is quite memorable.",8

B'Elanna pokes into Seven's personal E-Mail and finds a way to hook up the Transwarp Coil.But Janeway does not believe it, something in Denmark was Rotten.The Borg Queen tries to Suckle Seven, tells her how special she is, even that she was planted on Voyager deliberately. Maybe this is even true, Seven could have been in that special Alcove in her Original Cube just for that purpose. Who knows if The Borg had been watching Voyager's movements through the Delta Quadrant, and Species 857-6309 made an opportunity that The Queen could not resist. Resistance is Futile, isn't it?But The Queen, surprisingly, does not re-assimilate Seven, she is kept relatively intact, except for her new Eye that The Doctor slaved over.The Voyager Crew-Kid that was most upset with Seven's departure was Naomi Wildman, she offers Janeway a plan to retrieve Seven. And Janeway was looking at some odd Subspace Signals that had been recorded in Seen's Alcove - They identify them as Signals from The Queen. These are similar to the signals that Data found in Locutus, it's the way the Hive Mind communicates to all of its parts.So Now Janeway knows that Seven was Coerced for some unimaginable reason and sees no reason not to adopt Naomi's plan.Seven herself is still confused by this apparent ""Civility"" offered by The Queen, it is out of character. She Wants something, something that Seven can help her do. Seven is taken on an Assimilation Party, but she helps some Victims escape, but the Queen finds out about this. But then, the Queen in another uncharacteristic move, lets them go.When they get back to the Unicomplex, The Queen's true intent is revealed. It's just another attempt to Assimilate Earth.Janeway takes Tom, The Doctor and Tuvok in The Flyer with the Transwarp Coil installed and they use the Hansen's Shielding to get them right on top of the Unicomplex and then Janeway goes in to get Seven.But just as the Hansen's gadgets help her get close, The Queen had Assimilated that Tech. Seven sees her Father for the first time since she was a child, was this really him?But since Seven is plugged in to The Collective, she knows what The Queen knows and shows Janeway how to disconnect The Queen from her control over the collective, giving them a window of escape.So it is a race and a chase back to Voyager, only the Queen's ship is able to get into the Conduit after the Flyer opens it, but thats enough of a threat. When they get through, Chakotay bombards the Conduit and closes it.B'Elanna's sensors show ""Lots of Borg Signatures"" coming out of Transwarp - And it is our great relief as huge pieces and hunks of Borg Junk come flailing out!Suzanna gets recreated in time for ""Unimatrix Zero"", but after she flubs that one up, the Main Alice Queen has to take over. Poor Suzanna, she tries too hard, that's why she's only the second-rate Queen.",10

In other words, she rejoins the Collective! Soon you see the Borg Queen do her mega-cool entrance and she talks to Seven--informing her that her time on Voyager was all part of the Borg's master plan (yeah, right--you just don't want to admit you screwed up, Queenie!). Aboard Voyager, they make a discovery--that the Borg were beaming messages to Seven and perhaps she wasn't responsible for her recent actions. Naturally, the Captain wants to do on a rescue mission-- but they have to locate Seven first. What is the Queen's/Borg's plan? There obviously is more to the plan that we've seen so far.I generally enjoyed this episode. After all, it involves the Borg. However, I was surprised just how talky it all was when the Queen began talking and talking and talking to Seven--and it did seem to go on way too long and didn't make a lot of sense.",8

Voyager is helping a group of Xenophobic aliens make repairs to their ship's systems when Harry Kim has an affair with a female on the other ship which is a major no-no. The intimate encounter has an unexpected effect on Harry's body and the whistle is blown, much to the disappointment of Captain Janeway.What is nice about this episode and different from the previous ""Harry Kim develops feelings for (insert random female here) this time the girl likes him back and he handles himself pretty well with her, with no awkward stumbling.We soon learn that life on the Aliens ship is not enjoyed by all who are there and a secret separatist group is planning mischief.This episode features some nice moments between Janeway and Harry, and it's a nice break-out show for Garrett Wang. It's just doesn't seem fare that Captain Kirk nailed half the female life forms in the Alpha Quadrant and never got any diseases, but Harry Kim gets lucky 1 TIME and ends up with the Delta Quadrant's version of the clap.The camera work in this episode is really good. Many long tracking shots, one of which starts in the briefing room, goes to the bridge and ends in Janeway's Ready Room all in 1 shot. Very Cinematic.",8
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Disease (TV Episode 1999)","Way to go, Harry!","Let's cut to the chase. Harry Kim wasn't an especially good character on ""Star Trek: Voyager"". He was just way too one dimensional and his actor, Garrett Wang, seemed hampered by this. He was either the really shy and relatively dull guy or he was saving the ship or he was doing something to almost destroy the ship! In many ways, he was this series' version of Wesley Crusher. A few episodes back he actually DID destroy the ship (only to magically un-destroy it thanks to temporal thingamabobs) and here he sure comes close to destroying a fragile alliance!When the episode begins, Harry is having sex with some alien lady(?). This sort of stuff is against Starfleet regulations, as interspecies nookie has a proper series of channels that must be addressed first*. But the lovesick ensign acts more like a love- struck 14 year-old than a member of a professional crew. Naturally, when this dalliance comes to light, the Captain is furious, Harry apologizes and it all begins again. In the meantime, an underground movement among these aliens is discovered...and Mr. Kim is in the midst of it!This is a moderately enjoyable episode but it didn't give Mr. Kim a great chance to expand as a character. It just reinforces him as an immature and somewhat unlikable sort of guy. Not terrible but it sure could have been better.*These regulations they spout MUST have just been created (perhaps with Will Riker in mind). Riker routinely had sex with just about anything that moved--so saying that the captain and doctor need to approve on any Starfleet vessel before nookie can begin seemed odd to say the least!",6
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Disease (TV Episode 1999)","Great, great episode","Continuing a run of ""moral/ethical dilemma"" episodes characteristic for the exquisitely-good 5th series of ""Voyager"", this one (inexplicably given a low average mark by fellow reviewers) deals with the nature of love and loyalty, the value of rules, the conflicting desires for isolation and integration, as well as what all of these mean in the context of space missions that go far beyond normal tours of duty in the direction of whole lifetimes on board ship.Not bad for 40 minutes.Garrett Wang handles Harry's overwhelming relationship (with all its various consequences) with aplomb, and the Janeway-Kim interactions push towards the boundaries of what we expect from the characters in the hierarchy, but then ""Voyager"" is not in a fully predictable situation, is it? Obviously, there are many, many beautiful and ponderable messages here applying as well to planet Earth as they do to the galaxy's Delta Quadrant.Quite unusually for a ""Voyager"" episode, there is subtle and worthwhile - and at times moving - input into the main story from Chakotay, Seven, Paris, the Doctor and Tuvok. All do their thing just perfectly, without taking anything away from the episode's 3 main characters.If I wanted to imbue a young person with a thoughtful ethical approach, I would encourage binge-watching of series 5 of ""Voyager"", which is of so much higher quality than I recall, or than one might imagine.So much meaning wrapped up in there, it's a real and surprisingly vivid joy to revisit these episodes now, almost twenty years on from their first appearance...We know that ""Voyager"" took time getting into its stride, and would all too soon be facing some kind of decline into the final series, but in Series 5 it was doing brilliant things. So, much to be recommended for those who've not as yet indulged.",10
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Disease (TV Episode 1999)",Love for Harry,"When Voyager stops to help the Varro, a xenophobic race who have lived aboard a ship for several generations, avoided contact when ever possible. Over the course of the two weeks spent together is seems the Varro are only slightly less suspicious... apart from Tahl, a beautiful scientist who is engaged in an illicit relationship with Harry Kim, a relationship which could get them both in trouble. While Harry is working Seven notices his skin start to glow as he discussed Tahl so insists that he sees The Doctor who informs the captain when he learns of the relationship. It later becomes clear that this is a reaction the Varro get when they are in love. Things aren't made any easier when it is discovered that fractures found in the Varro ship have spread to Voyager and were caused by sabotage. When a Varro man is caught trying to stowaway aboard Voyager it becomes clear that not all of them want to continue the isolationist lifestyle, some of whom are trying to break up the Varro ship so they can go their own way. Despite being ordered not to see Tahl Harry beams her over to a shuttle so they can have some more time together. While he is showing her a nearby nebula they are caught by Tuvok who has something surprising to reveal to Harry.This was a good episode which gave Harry a chance for some much needed character development, it also gave a good insight into the relationship between Harry and the captain, showing that after five years on Voyager he is no longer the raw recruit, fresh out of the academy that he was when the series started. Musetta Vander did well in her guest role as Tahl, one can see why Harry fell for her charms.",8
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Disease (TV Episode 1999)",I'm Just Tired About Harry!,"Harry is one of the most tiresome characters in this series. At one point, he tells someone that he has never done anything wrong during the entire time on Voyager. Well, he may not have been caught or his transgression may not have resulted in serious damage, but he routinely is out of line and careless. I mean, just a couple episodes ago, it is his insistence that they take an untested shuttle into a dangerous situation, and the entire crew gets killed. Of course, saved by time travel. Anyway, I wanted this episode to be over. The companion plot involves a big ship that pretty much keeps its crew totally in check until a rebellion forms.",5
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Disease (TV Episode 1999)",At least we will always have a class 3 Nebula?!,"Good episode to a point. Been going through watching 'Voyager' recently as I never saw the last few series in my initial viewing some years back. We, my sister and I, always thought 'v'ger' As we called it, was the weaker of the 'Treks' - But I'm quite enjoying them and think I was a bit harsh in my, many years earlier views... Anywhoo..This episode was rather an odd ball one. Usually unflappable Ensign Kim - who after many heroics is still an Ensign... fall head over heals for a very pretty Alien engineer - They are found hanging out at what looks like her college dorm room at the beginning of the episode... Now Star Fleet has some proper regs about new aliens and whether one should get too familiar without medical advice etc but ya know 'feelings' etc - so all are sort of right as they go along - the Captain the Medical issues etc.. And Harry makes a big song and dance about his Alien lady... However the episode falls apart at the end, utterly and totally. After all the histrionics and Alien Engineer Tal gets her wish to leave her family ship - well she rather stay with here group of travellers then consider asking to go with Kim. And then we have Straight lased Ensign Kim who breaks regs for the women he loves so deeply etc - but he doesn't ask to go with her - nor does he ask her to go with him.... Bizarre... What? Does Kim think himself a Capi-tan Kirk, all of a sudden?? Anomalous episode! - surprisingly 'Seven' was able to unravel the malarkey to get a useful life lesson - lesser mortals like myself are still perplexed.",6
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Course: Oblivion (TV Episode 1999)",Tragedy in Space,"I have a big soft spot for it, mostly out of appreciation for the fact that the writers made an active choice to make it as tragic as possible. Voyager (and television in general) often tend towards stories that give last minute victories, sometimes at the expense of realism. In this case, the writers went with their better instincts.Voyager has been duplicated (see Season 4, Episode ""Demon"") and now they're starting to deteriorate. There's a lot of tension in this episode, both from the fact that anyone can die (including series regulars) and the conflict between the crew. This was still the era when they were having fun exploring the Chakotay / Janeway relationship and there's some real pathos after their divide becomes irrevocable.Certainly, there's a bit of illogic to the premise - there's no indication in ""Demon"" that the biomimetic compound can duplicate technology, especially not as complex as a starship or the Doctor's mobile emitter; and it's amazing how their clothes don't deteriorate, even though in ""Demon"" we see that the clothes are made of the same biomimetic compound as the people themselves. But the premise does allow the writers to force the characters to confront their own mortality in a very real way. Further, Janeway is confronted with a crisis that the real Janeway never has to truly confront: only be giving up any hope of ever returning to Earth can she hope to save her crew",9
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Course: Oblivion (TV Episode 1999)",So sad,"Some of the best Voyager episodes are ones where the crew suffers and their measure is taken. Of course we know that time travel will restore it (""Year of Hell""), or that the crew is not the real crew (""Course: Oblivion""). But it's still the same people.Forget about the fact that in the episode ""Demon,"" the final scene showed no hint of a copied Voyager, only its people. Perhaps the biomimetic fluid from the demon planet somehow absorbed the identity of the ship also. Perhaps the biomimetic crew had all the memories of the real crew and thus came to see themselves as the real crew - after all, who was the copy, and who was real? And somehow, the biomimetic crew, although first behind and then well ahead of the real Voyager, never elicited a ""deja vu"" reaction to either them or the real Voyager from alien species they encountered. And the real Voyager failed to scan the debris at the end of the episode for non-biomimetic materials brought on board the copied Voyager.It's all a very big stretch because the idea for this script was not integrated with previous episodes, but no matter.What is important is that you see good people, who try so hard, make some right decisions and some wrong decisions, and fail. This crew trades for a better warp engine that puts them far ahead of the real ship. This Tom Paris has the guts to marry B'Elana Torres. Janeway is a starship captain, whether mimetic or made of flesh and blood, and her mission is to go back to Earth. But then the Demon crew begins to disintegrate in their unnatural environment. Janeway and all the others realize that they are biomimetic lifeforms from a class Y Demon planet. Each copes in their own way with the realization that they are a copy doomed to a brief life. It is too late when Janeway finally realizes that home is behind them, not ahead of them. Janeway dies confused, barely able to speak coherently, after turning the ship with its super fast warp drive around. The last remnants of the crew do not give up, seek solutions in the face of utter oblivion, until there truly is no more solution and the last trick is out of the bag. One would like to think the real crew would have done the same if they faced impossible odds.In a bitter twist, the biomimetic Voyager, retracing its steps so much faster than the real one, almost encounters the ""mother"" ship.All the flesh-and-blood Janeway sees when she follows a distress call from an unknown ship, is some biomimetic matter, dissipating into interstellar space. She will never know that a piece of her died there, people with the same aspirations, who worked just as hard for the same goal, even if their goal was a phantasm.",7
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Course: Oblivion (TV Episode 1999)",An Episode That Deserves To Be Remembered,"This review definitely contains spoilers!""Course: Oblivion,"" like so many other episodes of Star Trek, tackles several easily accessible philosophical concepts. The concept most heavily addressed in the episode isn't a new one for the series, in fact many episodes of Voyager and other Trek series deal with self-identity and mortality, but it's the way the story plays out in the end that makes ""Course: Oblivion"" unique among the rest. After a tearful and heartfelt wedding between everyone's favorite lovebirds, the crew becomes deathly ill. It is soon discovered that they are decaying because they are not real. They are, in fact, the copies of Voyager and it's crew created on the ""Demon planet,"" but they now have the memories, feelings, and lives of the crew they were copied from. Janeway still wanted to get her crew home. Was that Earth? Was it a Demon planet in the Delta quadrant? As the ship falls to pieces, along with it's crew, Janeway struggles to accept that they will never make it home to Earth, but it's too late to make it home to the Demon planet either. How often do we see Starfleet Captains die on Star Trek? Starfleet Captains are the strongest, bravest, most brilliant people there are. But soon, Kim and Seven were the only ones left. They detected a ship, too far for their damaged system to communicate with. Their lives, and the memories of everything they ever were, everything their crew ever was, everything they'd accomplished, it all hung in the balance. Could they reach that other vessel in time to get help, to share their technological advancements with someone who might get them to the real Voyager, or at least to BE REMEMBERED by someone? Most of the time with Star Trek, the answer is yes. Just in the nick of time, the crew is rescued despite a few casualties. But not this time. This time they were all lost. Just as Ensign Kim reaches the other vessel, the copied Voyager vaporizes, leaving no survivors, and material so eroded and decayed that it would be impossible to find any sign of who the crew had been or where they'd come from. The real Captain Janeway on the real Voyager logged the damaged and destroyed remains of a vessel whose distress beacon they had been responding to, and the episode closed. It's interesting that the writers would give their audience, so used to tidy, happy endings, such a bleak one this time. We saw an entire race wiped out of existence in this episode, with absolutely nothing of themselves and their accomplishments left behind. Janeway was right when she told her crew that they deserved to be remembered, even if they were copies. This episode wants us to be uncomfortable with the ending. It is supposed to be painful and unpleasant, just as it can be incredibly painful and unpleasant to look within ourselves when discovering who we are as individuals and members of the human species. Often we find ourselves confronting the realization that we have no ""purpose,"" that life is accidental, and that what we thought we knew was always wrong. As the copy Janeway confronted the idea that she might not be a real person, that she might never be able to take her crew home, so did so many individuals realize that they don't fit into the particular box they have found themselves to be in, whether it be cultural, religious, social, or academic. The deaths of the copied Janeway and her crew may represent the loss of self that we all experience at some point in our lives. When we are older than we once were and we remember how different we used to be, it is almost is if a part of us is no longer living, or even like it never existed at all. With enough time, that part of us can even be completely forgotten, but that is the true tragedy. Not remembering what once was you, even if it hurts.",8
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Course: Oblivion (TV Episode 1999)","""We are all duplicates. None of us are real...""","This is the way the world ends... The crew of Voyager face a nightmare of monumental proportions when they discover that none of them are who they think they are. Wow. What a startling, eerie concept. Most of the crew seem to take this terrible revelation in stride, though. I mean really, when you think about it, what choice do they have, if not to go forward? I could see how, if you're not a Voyager fan or Star Trek in general, there are certain things about this episode which could be seen as laughable. Take for instance, the makeup of the melting(oh, what a world!) crew. On most of them it looks nothing so much as bits of porridge stuck to their faces. It looks very cheap and silly, with the exceptions of Harry Kim, Seven of Nine, and Neelix, who for some reason seemed to look different and more impressive. I just love Neelix in pizza mode! Also I think Kate Mulgrew's performance in this is one that could be seen as comical, as further into the story she sounds really groggy and almost drunk-more so than usual! And then of course there's the big glaring ""goofs"" of the replicated ship and the way it catches up to the real deal despite them being over twenty-thousand light-years apart! But if you're only watching this episode to gripe on things like that then you'll just ruin it for yourself. Go with the flow! I mainly enjoy it for how moving it is, and it really is quite the gut-wrencher! This to me is probably the most moving episode of the series-matched only by the ""Year of Hell"" two parter. This is the only time for me during the show that I found myself really mad at Janeway for her decisions. She's a true duplicate, right down to the trademark stubbornness. She was a fool to squander the precious time that could have saved them by carrying on the ""course of oblivion"" to Earth, and unknowingly sealing their fates. It's such an enormously tragic story, and it was just terrible to see the crew members die-even the ones I don't care about! I'm aware that they're not the real crew, but for me that knowledge doesn't make the proceedings any less devastating. The mind's aware that they're false, but, at the risk of sounding a little sappy, the heart's not listening! It's all so very grim, the way they are so violently turned away from the planet that could've saved them, and the way they lose the precious capsule that proved they ever existed, so they don't even get to have that cold comfort. A scene that brought tears to my eyes was the one where the captain passes away. I just found it really upsetting the way she touches his hand just before everything. And at the bitter end, when all that's left is a cloud of dust slowly dissipating to nothing in the cool blackness of space, the feeling is utter desolation. What the hell was it all for? What did their brief existence mean, if it ever really meant anything at all? Haunting questions that can never be answered. And of course the real tragedy was that no one would ever know... The reason I don't give this a ten is that ending. It's like, you're still sad the crew has just been erased, but then here comes a whole new crew that's alive and well once again! It's a very strange mixed-up sensation. They're dead, but right here. They never died at all, but they did! It's like the rug being pulled from under you, and completely abrupt. In season four's 'Demons' the clones all started with Harry Kim, and in this episode they end with him. This is an excellent, emotional powerful episode and I just love it, I even love how it doesn't compromise, with no no happy ending given, but it's still meaningful how they carried on up till the very end and never gave up. Perhaps that's something positive to take from this tale if you must. Or not.. Anyway it's just an utterly amazing episode to me and I think the depth of emotion that they managed to wring out of such an outlandish premise was fantastic and just so terrifically done. Bravo!!",9
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Course: Oblivion (TV Episode 1999)",Anybody can die,"When this episode opens it is likely that the viewer will think they must have missed a few episodes as Tom and B'Elanna are getting married and Voyager appears to have been using an advanced warp drive that will mean they will soon be back on Earth... then something goes terribly wrong; Voyager is starting to lose structural integrity, and further investigation shows that it isn't just the ship that is degrading; the crew and everything that has been on the ship more than a few months is also decaying. Obviously they will find a solution before any main cast member dies, or so one would think. When B'Elanna dies it comes as quite a shock. As the crew look back at the planets they have visited over the last few months they come to believe they were some how effected when they visited the Demon Planet (Season 4, Episode 24: Demon). It turns out it wasn't the crew of Voyager that was effected as this ship isn't Voyager, this ship and its crew are replicas of the original crew who had no idea what they were until things started to go wrong. Once it becomes clear that this isn't the real Voyager the viewer knows that nobody is guaranteed survival as they try to get back to the Demon planet before the ship disintegrates.This was a good episode, the fact that is wasn't about the ""real Voyager"" meant there was a greater sense of danger as anybody could die. The final scene where the real Voyager responds to their distress call was quite tragic; not only did the replica crew not survive but nobody would ever get to know what they had done in their brief lives.",8

Chakotay and Tuvok search through past events to find a cause and the end up finding that they are not the original crew! If anyone remembers the season four episode ""demons"", this is what happened to them. Basically they are clones. most people take the news in stride, Tom does not. There is one fairly rare thing that makes this episode memorable: the scenes between chakotay and Janeway where the totally disagree and, well, watch the scenes in the ready room you'll see that they're great.For creatures who aren't really voyagers crew these people behave like them to the ""T"". whatever ""memory engrams"" are they are obviously more than genetic material as far as personalities go.

After all, you get to slowly see the crew sicken and die--one by one. Depressing-- you betcha....but also very unique and worth seeing.When the show begins, Torres and Paris have just gotten married and life is just swell. However, soon after this B'Elanna gets sick, lingers just a bit and dies! In sickbay, however, they discover something REALLY shocking...B'Elanna has silver-colored blood! Soon they realize that she is NOT B'Elanna but a duplicate--and the same is true of everyone as well as the ship! Tuvok and Chakotay grasp for a solution and eventually put it all together---when the ship encountered the 'Demon Planet' in the previous season, it not only made copies of Kim and Paris but of EVERYTHING--and they are NOT the real Voyager!! And they all soon start to look like someone puked all over them (my daughter's words). Can they find a solution or are they all completely screwed?As I said, this is super-creative.

Been playing Binge Watching on Netflix for almost 2 months now watching all seasons from the beginning. First in the opening wedding scene I couldn't help but to cry at the wedding, as sappy as that sounds. First I thought OK this is probably some holodeck program, they really never got married (I did watch all the episodes when they originally aired) but the fun is I don't remember them after 15 years. So when I found out they were replicas from the daemon planet the biggest issue I had was, when Voyager left I only remember seeing ""the crew"" and no ship. How did they get a ship? If they made it they would have remembered that and therefore would have known there origin. Next I think something everyone is overlooking is they may not have all been forgotten. They had 8 months of interactions with other species and encounters that the real VOY did not. What are the odds that the real Voyager never crossed paths with any of the species they did (they were 20 light years away OK) but someone one day would have said ""we met you before"" or heard stories, which the real voyager crew would have said ""what not us??"" Am I making sense? Anyway I really enjoyed this episode as I do almost all of them.

If you have an affinity for lack of continuity and plot holes so big your brain will ooze out the side of your head than by all means watch and waste 43 minutes of your life. Sort of spoiler below: You can skip this one safely because the writers made sure that it will not affect anything ever because the episode was totally pointless.

If you do intend to watch it but I don't recommend it.Total sarcastic spoiler: People that think this episode is good their brains are demolecularizing into biometal compounds because they were duplicated months before but simply ""forgot"" about all that and will come to a tragic--stupid--end for no other reason than to clear up the utterly creepy idea of having a duplicate of yourself living on a demon planet from one of the other worst episodes on voyager.",1
12,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Course: Oblivion (TV Episode 1999)",This episode is very bad,"I'll tell you a resume of the episode:B'elanna and Tom get married, but immediatly we notice there's some weird distorsion on the ship.They realize it's the new enhanced warp drive (WHAT???) apparently what is causing it, and it's not only affecting the ship, but also the crew, which makes no sense, because they made simulations and it couldn't affect humanoid life.
A pity, because the enhanced drive would get them to earth very quick.B'elanna gets very sick and dies.Then they realize that they're actually duplicates from the demon planet, made with the silver biomimetic goo from several episodes before, and the ship too, but they don't knew it. They forgot for some reason (??????).Eventually, everyone is going to die, unless they find another demon planet, or return to their original planet, but it isn't really clear that they would survive, anyways.The captain still insists into getting everyone to Earth, because she's as stupid as the real captain, so they lose a lot of valuable time that they don't have.They find a demon class planet along the way to Earth, but faithful to Voyager's style, a ship launchs from the planet warning them that they go away or be destroyed, so they're forced to leave after taking some damage. At this point i must say that the delta quadrant seems like the perfect place to arrive with a fleet of starships carrying Genesis Torpedoes, so you ""reset"" the entire quadrant of any biological life, because the current ones are just a bunch of aggressive assholes, and idiots. I mean, every single of Voyager's episodes is about finding some idiot that wants to destroy them. Any resemblance with the original Star Trek style is pure coincidence.When enough people die, including Chakotay, she realizes she's stupid, and decide to get back to the original demon planet, and to build a probe with their logs, and stuff they did, so someone will remember them. The probe is going to be built with real materials they got along the way, because everything else on the ship is really the silver stuff, and it's going to ""die"".Everything on the ship is failing.At this point i thinked that they would launch the probe, with the enhanced warp engine, and Voyager would find it, but the probe fails to launch because of damage on the launching system, and is destroyed.They detect the real Voyager on their sensors (because space isn't that big anyways ??????), so you think they're going to transfer the data directly to Voyager, but by the time the real ship gets there, there's nothing left of the duplicate ship, but a lot of goo floating on space. They don't even realize the similarity of the compound.So, absolutely nothing that happens on the episode is worth anything. It was the most useless history they could have made. The sad part is that they lost the opportunity to make the episode worth something. They just needed to get the specs of the enhanced warp drive to the real Voyager. That's important stuff. But no, it got lost. As a sidenote, take notice that the duplicates were quite better than the originals, as the real Voyager didn't get any improved warp drive and they would have reached Earth a lot sooner than the originals. 
And remember: the real B'elanna couldn't even keep running the transwarp core they stolen from the Borg. It seems like that stuff ""depletes"", but can't you even replicate it, or analize it??? But hey! who the heck thinks that having a half-klingon engineer (or even character) is a good idea, anyways???",2

I smell the angry stench of Brannon Braga...Let's be clear: Voyager as a series is hot pig garbage. The writers hate the characters, the producers hate the format, the entire creative team hates themselves and their audience. How else can you explain week after week of black, torturous trauma, of painful death and plague, of demonic possession and slow death and punishment both physical and mental? I'm watching this cosmic train wreck of a series only because I'm currently stuck at home and addicted to all things Trek. I would not wish this program on my worst enemy.This week B'Elanna, Chakotay, Doctor & Janeway die- yes: die- and the rest of the crew learns that they're actually alien replicants and that their entire lives and memories are fraudulent. I'm making the popcorn! Those unlucky enough to live through the episode are rewarded with cancerous lesions on their face as their bodies are wracked with disease and eaten alive from the inside. (Are we having fun yet?) Lots of insulting techno-babble is expelled from the mouths of the actors in an attempt to justify the torture and abuse... none of it makes a lick of sense.A last-minute alternate reality/time travel contrivance is supposed to set straight the travesty we've just witnessed, but it's a light year late and a dollar short: once again the underlying theme is the writers KILLING the main characters because they had no better ideas.Disgusting. Repulsive. Offensive. Gross. Insulting. These are the nicest words I can think of to describe this episode and the majority of the series. Maybe next week the Voyager writers will show some mercy and just let the ship explode in space, killing everyone on board instantly and putting an end to their pain and suffering... or maybe the writers are just cowards who will continue the abuse indefinitely.GRADE: F",1

Too many of the characters on this show were shallow and needed more depth-- and Chakotay was one of the worst of these. Whenever the show wants to feature his character in an episode, they cart out the 'ol faux American Indian mystical crap. Most American Indians probably cringed whenever they did this one the show and they took SOME genuine cultural beliefs and made them seem like silly clichés.In this episode, aliens inside 'chaotic space' (that's Voyager-speak for 'we are sitting in the middle of space because we cannot afford to build sets for a new world or make-up for these aliens'). The ship is stuck there and only Chakotay is possibly able to help get them un-stuck. To do this, he goes on a spirit journey and explores his own nutty grandfather, his love of boxing (which NEVER was mentioned before) and his own fears. This episode has absolutely nothing going for it. You might try watching just so you can see world champion boxer Carlos Palomino in a role as Chakotay's sparring partner, but underneath all that make- up and prosthetics you cannot even tell that it's him. So, if there ever was an episode to skip and pretend that it wasn't made in the first place, my vote would be for this one!",1
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Fight (TV Episode 1999)",Trapped in chaotic space!,When Voyager enters something known as chaotic space something there effects Chakotay. As he is boxing on the holodeck he sees something strange just before his opponent knocks him out. At first it is assumed the effect is due to him being hit but it soon becomes apparent that something has activated a dormant gene which enables him to hear the voices of an alien intelligence present in the chaotic space. Fearing that he is losing his mind he goes on a vision quest where he meets his grandfather who was considered mad due to him having the same gene active and declining treatment for it. His visions keep taking him back to the boxing ring where he is preparing for a bout against an unseen opponent. Various members of Voyager's crew keep giving reasons why the fight shouldn't be allowed and when it finally does he learns what the aliens were trying to say and is able to navigate Voyager back to normal space.This wasn't a bad episode although by concentrating on just one main character who wasn't sure of his own sanity it could be a little confusing at times... to be fair I suspect that was a deliberate attempt to put the viewer in his position.,7

Beyond that misreading, Robert Beltran gives it his all. Just sad that every episode that gives him a solo shot is tied to the whole vision quest BS.Love Voyager, but not this one.",1

Chakotay seems to have some boxing chops and he is quite masculine. He goes on one of his vision quests and tries to figure out how they can get out of their predicament. He hears voices and needs to interpret them to figure out what to do. Mostly it is one oddity after another. Perhaps it should be called ""Chaotic Plot.""",5
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Fight (TV Episode 1999)","Once again the Heart of Trek, and it is dismissed and panned","Trek is supposed to be about meeting life that is so different, ideas that are so strange that there is no way to make a connection to it - It must make a connection to you. That is what happens here. In some ways this reminds me of the 3rd Season Original Series episode ""Spectre of the Gun"" - Trek's 1966 statement of the film ""Hour of the Gun"" starring James Garner, also about the ""OK Corral"" incident - Probably the darkest film ever made about the Earp brothers, and one of the darkest Original Series episodes. But that was 1966. this was 1996 or so, 20 years later - New Trek premises, new Crew members. So where the Original Series used The Melkosians to get into Kirk's mind and dredge up The Old West, this episode gets into Chakotay's mind and uses - BOXING, of all things - to get ideas across, mainly to get ONE idea across to Chakotay: Namely,""Rentrillic Trajectory"".The only connection is in Chakotay's Genes, who had a relative that could see different planes of existence. The only problem was that said relative, Chakotay's Great-Grandfather (Played by the also great first nation actor Ned Romero in Chakotay's Flashbacks) was considered insane.It takes a while for us to start understanding what's happening, as this episode starts at the end and then goes back to the beginning. Chakotay was using his Holodeck Boxing program, at the same time Voyager because exposed to what 7-of-69 (you understand the concept of humor, right?) calls ""Chaotic Space"". so in an odd series of flashbacks, the story jumps backward to The Doctor asking Chakotay to go back over the last few days to find out just when everything started going sideways.This experiment in Disjointed Storytelling worked well with the story that was being told, because it mirrored what was happening from Chakotay's point of view. But what I enjoyed in this, it was a Boxing story, and Robert Beltran appears to have had experience with Boxing, it seems like he's doing all of his own stunts.This show also includes Boothby, the beloved Groundskeeper of the Academy, who has been involved with just about every cadet who visited those hallowed halls. And Ray Walston was doing his best Burgess Meredith impression the day they were doing this, it's perfect.Ideas like this are what made Trek in The Original Series, what kept it alive in the Films, and what Next Generation cut it's teeth with. I feel this is a return to true form for Trek. The concept was so odd that they had to create a metaphor for it, because ideas like ""Rentrillic Trajectory"" don't translate into English well. The concept that was in Chakotay's mind was so different it could only be understood from his viewpoint with his Boxing metaphor. and it's a successful marriage of ideas, including Chakotay's Native American gadget that starts his Dream Quests.Therefore writer Michael Taylor succeeded with the concept and it was polished by TNG veteran Joe Menosky, to give us a startling and unusual story of Voyager's wanderings through the Delta Quadrant. Robert Beltran's gruff style was great for the Boxing angle.And the very last few frames are perfect. I believe Chakotay was the great under appreciated character of Voyager, and it was only in the last two seasons, they gave him some great shows, and even a relationship with 7-of-69 (lighten up) - He deserved it.",10

It seems that Kurros and his friends on his ship are a think tank--rather amoral beings who will do things to help various species if they are willing to meet their demands. In this case, they want a few things that seem trivial*--as well as Seven of Nine! It's not selling into slavery, exactly--they want to make her a part of their group. But there is definitely an interesting hidden agenda.I liked the twist--even though I had anticipated it in this one. The show also ends extremely well and is quite satisfying.

We are told much about them but it is clear that the helper expects to be generously compensated for his work. The action then switches to Voyager which is having problems with a group of Hazari bounty hunters who are trying to steal the ship. It looks as if there is no way out of the bounty hunter's trap when Kurros, the alien we saw in the opening scene, appears in the captain's room explaining that he can solve the problem for a price. He explains that he is part of the ""Think Tank"" a group of aliens who seek out unique items they wish to acquire and help people solve apparently unsolvable problems in exchange. When shown a list of things they want in exchange the captain is at first willing... until she sees the final item on the list; Seven of Nine. When Voyager manages to capture a Hazari ship they find evidence that they were hired by Kurros so it was little wonder that he had the solution to their problem as he had created it. Once the Hazari know that they are being used Janeway persuades them to help her tern the tables on Kurros.This was a decent episode with a few good action scenes, it was a nice twist to find that Kurros had been behind the problems all along; although not explicitly stated I assume we are meant to believe most if not all the problems they solved were of their own making.",7

In order to save Voyager and the surrounding space the two Malon survivors along with Chakotay, B'Elanna and Neelix must return to the Malon ship to prevent it from exploding. One of the Malon is worried believing that the problems are due to a mythical creature that lives in the radioactive waste. His colleague rubbishes the idea as superstition but when one Malon is killed and Chakotay is attacked and injured it is clear that something or someone on board does not want them to succeed in preventing the explosion.This was a good episode which had an obvious environmental message but didn't show the Malon as bad people just somewhat selfish as a race although individuals did dangerous work to keep their own world clean. The scenes of on the Malon ship were tense; reminding be slightly of Alien in the way the ship itself was creepy and something was after them... although obviously that something was far less violent; this is Star Trek after all.

Of course, there is a reason why these things went wrong, but Voyager Members must needs to be sent into the middle of a Maelstrom of Theta Radiation to get to the Bottom of it.To make Matters Worse, B'Elanna is having a Klingon Fit and is suffering the browbeating of Janeway, Chakotay and Tuvok- Tuvok tries to teach her some Vulcanian Brain-Meditation Techniques, to apparently No Avail.Apparently, there is some kind of Malon Radiation-Monster which is attacking the Malon crew of Toxic Avengers, in fact, ""it"" kills off all of the Malons save Ron Canada and Lee Arenberg. Alexander Enberg steps away from his Voyager Vulcan role to play a 3rd Malon Engineer who gets melted by Radiation (You can only identify him by his Voice).Mostly I liked this ep due to the interactions of Ron Canada and B'elanna. They want to kick each other's arses but they end up having a respect for each other, save for B'elanna giving the guy a Mouth Lashing at the end.But the very thing which is causing B'elanna problems with the Voyager Crew is the one thing which saves her, Neelix and Ron Canada from being converted into Atomic vapour.This episode also tells us more about the Malon culture, and that they have built a beautiful culture which can only exist by polluting the entire Delta Quadrant.

It turns out that this Malon ship is about to explode--and this will wipe out everything within several light-years. Naturally, you learn that Voyager's warp drive is inexplicably offline and so there's no other option but to stay and try to fix this ship or deflect it into a nearby sun. But there are some difficulties--most of the Malon crew are dead and there might just be a monster aboard their ship that is causes all these problems!This is a decent episode but the ending involving Torres was supposed to be important because Torres tried so hard not to be violent.

Not the vast philosophical concerns or mysteries of time and space, but the interaction between and among those holding unique perspectives of the universe. The main plot -- the Pygmallion story of the Doctor and Seven of Nine -- is a compelling examination of how we learn from those we seek to teach. Both the Doctor and Seven explore social ritual and protocol in an effort to expand Seven's capacity to engage the crew. The template for this experiment is ""dating"". In the course of his teachings, the Doctor develops a truly deep appreciation and affection for Seven, and she is, in turn, shown in a most compelling and humorous light, though never as the brunt of the joke. Alas, Seven does not directly share the Doctor's romantic feelings, but her earnest gratitude is most evident.So, how does this episode come to epitomize Star Trek? For its utter compassion, empathy and ...well... sweetness. There is a tenderness to it that exists very much at the core of the ""mission"". Understanding. Compassion. Peaceful co-existence. And, more than anything, Mutual Respect.Thus far, it is my favorite single episode -- not because it is emblematic, but, mostly, for the brilliant performances of Jeri Ryan and Robert Picardo, as they come to embody the ""wonder"" of it all.

Scott Thompson (The Kids in the Hall & The Larry Saners Show) plays the ambassador in a hilarious performance.We also meet a crew member on the ship who isn't killed after speaking 2 lines, and he has a personality. He's the one Seven of Nine asks to dinner.This one is more about laughs and singing and Seven of Nine's feelings, showing she does have a heart beneath the catsuit and Borg Impants. This one is worth the watching for Scott Thompson alone.",7
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Someone to Watch Over Me (TV Episode 1999)",Continuing Seven's social development,"This episode took a break from meeting potentially dangerous situations and instead concentrates mostly on the development of the characters of Seven and the Doctor. Seven is continuing to study relationships which leads to a run in with B'Elanna who is not at all happy that Seven is monitoring her and keeping a record of her relationship with Tom Paris, including some fairly intimate details. The Doctor suggests that instead of observing others she should attempt to form a relationship herself. He gives her lessons but she is unsure who she should attempt to date but eventually picks a potential suitor and invites him to have a meal with her on the holodeck. Unfortunately this goes wrong when she accidentally hurts him while trying to dance. It looks like Seven will have nobody to accompany to an upcoming social event but the Doctor volunteers and all goes well till Seven learns of a wager between him and Tom. While this is going on Neelix is acting as ship's ambassador and escorting the visiting Kadi ambassador while the captain is away negotiating with their government. The Kadi are a pious people who pray several times a day and avoid anything which could be considered stimulating such as highly flavoured food or any intoxicant. Given this Neelix is rather surprised when that is all the ambassador wants to experience.This episode had more laughs than most; The ambassador's drunken activities were laugh out loud funny and Seven's lessons were amusing too they also revealed that Seven has an impressive singing voice. The end where the Doctor realises that he has developed feeling for Seven but they aren't reciprocated is quite touching.",9

But the moment his Boss, Vedek ""Abbot"" (Ian Abercrombie) leaves, he suddenly doesn't want to adhere to the religious itinerary he was supposed to adhere to.Meanwhile Seven of Sixty-Nine is still taking Hoomanity Lessons from The Doctor, he's got her up to the point where she can try Dating. Tom Paris scoffs at this and makes a gentleman's wager with Doc as to the outcome of Seven's Date with Lt. Chapman (Brian McNamara) which Seven has selected as the only male in Voyager's crew that meets her rigid criteria. She had let Harry Kim down gently in the Astrophysics lab.In fact, Seven had been closely monitoring Tom Paris and B'Elanna Torres, she had stashed away several Gigaquads of data just on their ""Intimate Activities"" which Seven claims can be heard by the whole deck. B'Elanna offers to break Seven's nose for the trouble but is distracted at the last minute.Meanwhile, Tomin plants himself squarely in front of a replicator with a knife and fork and gobbles down every dish he can find starting with Bajoran Hasperat- These Kadi Vedeks are not supposed to enjoy any spicy foods, so Mexican is out for him.But before Neelix, who is assigned to keep an eye on Tomas, can stop him, Tomas had found his way into Tom Paris' French bar Holo-Program ""Sandrine's"" and had discovered alcoholic beverages- And Exotic Bolian and other alien Women. Thus Neelix needs to introduce him to Coffee.The booze just isn't wearing off, and he makes an Arse out of himself in the Galley by trying to make a grab at Seven, whose Date ended with almost breaking Chapman's arm while dancing. The Doctor was trying to win the bet by inviting Seven to the event, but Tom turns the tables on the Doc by admitting defeat- In front of her.So we end up with an Alien Ambassador passed out in Sickbay, and the normal ways The Doc has to sober a person up will not work on this guy's metabolism. So Seven has to inject him with Nanoprobes just to get him to the point where he can stand up in front of his Abbot.Ironically, Abbot tells Tomas of the wasted opportunity to indulge in Debauchery- As long as he did not make a ""habit"" of it.Now, to make matters worse, The Doc in teaching Seven how to sing ""You Are My Sunshine"" has fallen in love with her!But he's too chicken to do anything about it.

It's obviously a take off on ""Pygmalion""--both from the Shaw novel of the same name as well as the ancient myth of Pygmalion and his protégé, Galatea. The show starts off with two plots--one slight and silly and the other slight but hiding some real depth as well. The slight story is about an ambassador named Tomin (Scott Thompson) coming to hang with the crew of Voyager. His planet is known for their stuffiness and piety--so Neelix plans on all sorts of dull activities for him. Instead, however, Tomin mostly spends his time being a total glutton, drinking to excess, chasing women and being an annoying drunk. The other story, which I much preferred, has to do with Seven of Nine and the Doctor. The Doctor has decided to take her on as a project. He wants to teach her the basics of dating, relationship and sex. It's no small order, that's for sure. During this process, the Doc makes a bet with Paris (just like Henry Higgins did with Colonel Pickering) and the results are extremely similar--with the Doctor falling for his project. Overall, this is an extremely enjoyable show. While the material is familiar, it's handled exquisitely. Plus, to me, the Doctor and Seven are the most interesting characters on the show, so it's nice to see them featured together.",9

But as this happens, the Doc (Henry Higgins) begins to feel a romantic attraction for our Borg bombshell. Jeri Ryan is perfection in her role. She connects with him, but we have to remember that her circuitry works differently. She admires her successes but doesn't quite cross the threshold. There are some seriously touching scenes. Meanwhile, a subplot is the adventures of a young man from a sterile planetary society going bonkers when he finally gets to spread his wings, overeating, overindulging, and carrying on in general.

She takes refuge in a book shop owned by one Henry Janeway who is the last person in town who hasn't sold his property to developers who wish to build the Millennium Gate tower, a building that will be a self-contained biosphere containing a large shopping mall amongst other things. Henry is not keen on change however and it looks as though the tower will have to be built elsewhere. As more details are revealed the captain learns that her ancestor wasn't quite the pioneer she thought and only had a relatively minor role in the tower's construction and was never part of the Mars exploration missions as she had been led to believe.The weakness of the episode was largely down to the fact we knew Shannon would end up with Henry in the end due to his surname. It wasn't without its strengths though, it was nice that the Shannon was just a normal person not the leader in her field the captain believed as that would have been cliché.",6

If we could all look back in to our past with this kind of clarity, with romanticized data filling in the holes, would be not do it? Where and what were my ancestors doing 300 - 400 years ago? What was life like back then? In this case, Captain Janeway is looking back to time that I actually lived in. That is just too cool. It is time travel but through stories passed down from generation to generation. I can classify exactly why, but I love it!Yes, Voyager in not 99% destroyed in this episode as it is in most.

The dialogue is trite and really difficult to endure. I watched this episode once and won't bother again. The premise about the millennium, I guess at the time was supposed to be involving, but considering the millennium didn't start for another two years (2001) this really was out of place, technically. It drudges on and there is no real point to the story. It lifts out completely and ads nothing at all to my appreciation of Janeway. Feel free to skip without missing anything. Its not like they even make a connection to Janeway, or tell us how it has any real significance to her; maybe if they linked it and showed a real unique or unexpected time-connection that could have made it better, or ad some mystery to it. Its just not there... fire whomever wrote this tripe. I can hardly remember what it was about; a bookstore or something. Just like I don't care for the 'Fair Haven' or really any major 'Holodeck' based episode on TNG or any of the them. I watch Star Trek to see spaceships and exploration of the 'Trek' galaxy. Not to see something that would have been rejected from 'Masterpiece Theatre' for being too dull.",1
6,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" 11:59 (TV Episode 1999)",Truly dull and uninteresting,"I'd like to start this review by saying that I have never before written a film/TV show review on IMDb, or anywhere else that I can recall. I just don't have interest in doing so. The fact I have now taken the time to write one for this episode is a testament to just how bad this episode was.I've always enjoyed Trek, from a very young age I watched TNG, and then DS9. DS9 was by far my favourite and some years ago I re-watched them all on DVD. But I was never able to get into Voyager. After having re-watched TNG I decided it was time to give Voyager another go. And it's not half as bad as I recall - it's not great and overall seems a bit wanting at times with rather 2D characters, but there are some great stories and overall I'm enjoying it.Series 5 has been hard work, though. It feels like the whole series is filler with (virtually) no killer. The episode before this (the Doctor falling in love with Seven) was pretty poor - character development, particularly for the Doctor and Seven is interesting, but there was no B-plot. The ambassador who is essentially monk-like who ends up completely inebriated is not a plot, it's all utterly pointless. Still, I digress. Then came 11:59.Dear, sweet Lord - 'dull' doesn't do it justice. It's mind-numbingly boring and, worse, utterly pointless. An important part of a TV show, especially one as long-running as Voyager, is that we have to care about the characters and be invested in them. This obviously happens over time and develops over time also. And that's where the problem with this episode lies: why do we care about Janeway's almost-400-year-old relative and her frankly boring story? We don't. It has no bearing on the events of the present (within Voyager), it doesn't explain anything or add anything to Janeway's character that we didn't already know. Which makes it entirely redundant.I honestly couldn't watch it all the way through to the end, I was too bored. I should add that I'm someone who can happily watch a 6 part 1960s Dr Who story, so it's not my impatience that's the problem here.Thankfully, I'm now watching the next episode (Relativity) and while I can't yet say how good it is, at least something is actually happening.",1

Overall, however, the thing it makes me wonder most is this: why does every starship seem to have nearly unlimited information about earth history? Voyager apparently has access to 20th/21st century birth/death/marriage certificates, voter registration forms, census forms, &c. At least in TNG or DS9 that could be explained-away as them accessing the Federation network, but that's certainly not the case here, out in the Delta Quadrant.

This device was installed by somebody from the future and will cause temporal anomalies to tear the ship apart. The problem is finding when the device will be installed. When Seven is detected she is beamed out but is killed in the process. With the benefit of time travel she is recruited again and sent to another likely time frame two years before she joined Voyager's crew. When she returns there is an unusual sensor reading which Janeway remembers has happened once before; when she first came aboard Voyager. Seven is captured but manages to persuade the captain that she isn't a threat and is trying to save the ship. Seven is shocked when she finds who is trying to plant the device, it is none other than Braxton, the captain of the Relativity. The only person more shocked is Captain Braxton who is promptly arrested for the actions of his future self. This doesn't stop future-Braxton though as he manages to escape, he is chased through time by Seven but the constant time jumps are starting to effect her.This was a good episode and while it isn't too easy to explain the multi-time line plot it makes sense when one watches it.

I mean, what if the Borg have this capability? Couldn't they go back to the beginning of time and simply make the universe Borg?

Again we see Janeway and crew die, we see Voyager destroyed and later in 'dry doc' at Utopia Planitia Fleet Yard, prior to their Delta Quadrant escapade. This instalment offers Seven in a Starfleet uniform, some phaser shootouts and an overall interesting time travel yarn. Granted a reintegration McGuffin, the ability to merge characters at the end wraps it up too nicely, but the twist and turns are enough to peak interest. With time doubles of Janeway, Seven of Nine and more, Star Trek: First Contact being mentioned by Seven as an example to explain the Pogo paradox and localized time discrepancies there's plenty of fun to be had.Seven of Nine actress Jeri Ryan shines here and is given plenty to do as the time travelling recruit, enlisted to stop a saboteur planting a device on Voyager. Kate Mulgrew as Captain Kathryn Janeway offers subtly between her character in different time periods which helps sell the outlandish premise.While fans may get a kick out of the multiple Sevens, its link with Timeless and Future's End episodes where Braxton is portrayed Allan G. Royal, here in Relativity he is played by acting veteran Bruce McGill. This episode debatably works better without seeing the episode Future's End, not only because it gives the twist more of an impact, it also avoids raising more plot questions than it cares to answer.

Voyager finds them and rescues them.Apparently this ship got caught by the Caretaker as well, and has been travelling through the Delta Quadrant trying to reach home.Skipping past all the character introductions and meeting their Voyager counterparts, it turns out the Equinox and Captain Ransom have a DARK AND EVIL SECRET, because nothing like this ever happens in the Trek universe without the other captain being blatantly evil.So it turns out that these spooky ghost-y aliens are actually nucleogenic lifeforms, and they traded an energy converter with the keeper species for one of them. They wanted to study it, but it died, and they realized they could somehow convert its bodily substance into energy to make them go home faster. They travelled 10,000 lightyears in two weeks.It's NEVER stated in the episode whether they took more of these creatures to kill them and use their body, nor is it explicitly implied---given that they only took ONE and then travelled TEN THOUSAND LIGHTYEARS AWAY, it's kind of impossible for them to go back on a raid for more.Nevertheless, Janeway the Despot decides this is EVIL, UNJUST, and a VIOLATION OF THE PRIME DIRECTIVES! And because SHE decides it, that makes it true, despite the fact that the Equinox didn't have the sort of special adventures the Voyager did that allowed them to HAX time and space and find wormholes or Kes or quantum multi-spectral interferometric bullshit bullshits to let them get home faster.A one-hundred plus year journey (because the Equinox cannot go past warp 8) could be cut down to less than two months, but JANEWAY THE DREAMCRUSHER says THIS IS WRONG AND EVIL because it involved killing ONE alien spooky ghost thing.So she decides in her insane mind to arrest ALL the crewmembers, regardless of innocence or guilt or the captain being responsible for their actions, and locking them in their quarters, where once they reach Earth in 20 or 30 years, they'll be put in prison for 30 years for... FOLLOWING THE PRIME DIRECTIVE IN TRYING TO FIND THE QUICKEST WAY HOME AND TO SAVE AS MANY LIVES OF THEIR CREW AS POSSIBLE! Yes, JANEWAY THE BABYKILLER sees breaking ONE part of the Prime Directive in order to follow ANOTHER part as not a moral ambiguity or a conundrum of survival, but an ABANDONMENT OF OUR OWN HUMANITY! She believes that the Equinox and all their crew should have just dropped dead under nonstop hostile alien attacks (unrelated to this issue of using the ghost alien) or else die of old age trying to travel to the Alpha Quadrant, rather than bending the rules for a greater good.It's something SFDebris once stated as a comparison between Sisko, Picard, and Janeway; Sisko follows the Prime Directives, and breaks them only when they get in the way of human decency and compassion. Picard follows the Prime Directives, no matter what usually because of human decency and compassion.Janeway the Tyrant, meanwhile, follows the Prime Directives no matter what, usually to the detriment of human decency and compassion.And that malevolent scumbag Janeway has the GALL to claim that abandoning our principles is abandoning that which makes us human.

I really do mean driven: the victory-at-any-cost-and-heck-with-any-other-view, type of driven we see again two seasons later, but here she pulls back and listens before the final moment as opposed to watching the reality unfold at her opponents death.The conversation Chakotay has with the captain in sickbay and the Borg (seven) in the ready room are not exactly intense but the are central and vital to the episode, not to mention cool; don't miss them. To find the meaning of the episodes title and the code word ""scorpion"" you will have to watch part one, which is pretty much as good as this one.The only problem I have with the episode is that we find out a season or so later that the ""enemy"" they unite against was not and is not an invading force as it is displayed and nearly flat out stated in this episode.

Of course, the name of this episode comes to fruition. Remember the classic story and what happens. The Borg are a collective and the consummate opportunists.

Instead, too many episodes involved such dull topics as temporal fluxes and holodeck-bound shows. Parts 1 and 2 of ""Scorpion"" are clearly like breaths of fresh air for the series and usher in a better and more intense sort of show you'd see more of starting with these shows.At this point in the two-part episodes, Voyager has made an alliance with the Borg. However, Chakotay STILL is worried about this and thinks the Captain was mistaken. I liked this because it's very consistent with his Maquis roots and his misgivings turned out to be very well founded when the Borg started trying to assimilate their new 'friends'! So, IF they manage to defeat the scarier than the Borg new species, they will likely then have to battle the Borg to the death...or assimilation.In addition to being a darned good show, this also is the introduction of Seven of Nine. She brought some interesting plots to the show, though I also suspect they brought this lovely blonde to the show more for her physical assets. Regardless, the show did improve with the introduction of this character. A must-see show.",10

During an 8472 attack, the cube is destroyed, but some drones and Janeway are beamed off the cube onto Voyager. Janeway is incapacitated, so Chakotay breaks off the alliance with the Borg and seals the drones in the cargo bay. Voyager continues to develop the technology. They eventually open a singularity to the 8472 realm, and enter their realm. Voyager destroys many 8472 ships with its new technology, so all the 8472 ships leave the Delta Quadrant, ending the war. After Voyager returns to the Delta Quadrant, Seven of Nine attempts to take over the ship and return the drones to the Borg.

1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Gift (TV Episode 1997)",A Highlight of all Star Trek,"This episode touches on one of the main focuses of Star Trek: the definition and refinement on human nature. Every episode that has touched on this subject has almost always been a highlight of Star Trek. Similar to the birth of a human from a positronic brain, or the evaluation of the Prime Directive, this episode tackles humanity.Janeway distinguishes herself as a Picard, and other greats, to have a human imperative that steadfastly has the need to employ humanity. Seven of Nine is portrayed perfectly as a human conscience wrapped in a shell of conformity, only cracked from a woman with a conviction: humanity has a will, and a need to be realized among all who have the potential and willingness.However even more dynamically, Janeway evolves the sense of realizing humanity in Seven of Nine. Seven wants to return to the Borg, citing its her freedom to choose so, as a human. Janeway evolves humanity against the charge of hypocrisy, stating that no human would choose to be enslaved by the conformity of the Borg, and that Seven is not completely human yet. Janeway adds another definition to humanity as defined by Star Trek, in her assertion to Seven of Nine.The sub-plot for Kes is somewhat abrupt, changing appearance, abilities, and even her state of matter within a few episodes.Spoilers herein: you have been warned.Kes' new powers are abrupt, however the saving grace is the ability to portray it as an ascension, as seen in an episode of The Next Generation: the idea that past the accomplishment of warp, there is another accomplishment for species. That accomplishment is the ability to perceive matter, space, and time as one unified state of existence.This acts as an interesting deus ex machina for the plot, sending Voyager through a ""super-warp"" that shortens their journey by ten years. It's a relief though, after many failed attempts for an expedited method home for the crew.On the basis of a ""popcorn"" entertainment episode, this episode may be a seven out of ten, but on a grander and deeper scale, this episode reverberates as a continuation of a higher sense of Star Trek, adding a well-deserved two more stars! Seven of Nine + 0.222 = ~9/10 stars! (7/9 + 0.2 = ~.9 = ~9/10)",9
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Gift (TV Episode 1997)",Fair well to a favourite character,"After gaining an unwilling passenger in the previous episode Janeway must decide what to do with Seven of Nine and defend her decisions against charges of hypocrisy; after all is there any difference between the Borg forcing other species to join their collective and Janeway forcing Seven to remain on Voyager without her connection to the Borg. The captain argues that Seven isn't in a position to make a decision as her Borg implants are controlling her and that she can't decide whether or not to stay on board until her humanity is restored. It isn't just Seven who is having to come to terms with her changing nature; Kes's telepathic powers are increasing to the point where she is able to effect matter at a subatomic level which is danger to the ship and crew.While there is some action this is first and foremost a character driven episode where we are given an interesting insight to the captain's thinking and the nature of humanity. After three seasons it was a shame to see Kes depart from the series, Jennifer Lien did a good job in the role.",8

Kes' psychic abilities continue to improve--and Tuvok is concerned because they are so powerful and, at times, almost god-like. The other plot involves Seven of Nine. Her Borg implants are now being rejected since she's no longer a part of the collective. The Doctor can either let her die or remove them. But this is like playing god and violates the Prime Directive, as they take them out despite her objections. Does this make Janeway a hypocrite? Perhaps...but also an expedient one. Overall, the title of the show, ""The Gift"" has meaning for both of these women and is a fascinating show with interesting ethical dilemmas. Well worth seeing...and a show you really MUST see due to its impact on the rest of the series and its characters.",9
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Gift (TV Episode 1997)","Goodbye to Jennifer, Hello to Jeri","Out with the old, in with the new?Jennifer didn't even know she was ""Being Replaced"" with a Borg until she got the script for this episode. I can't forgive Berman for this, I never have. But then again I never knew this until recently, at the time, sure I was very disappointed.Voyager could have and should have kept both characters, even if one of them was only a recurring character, like Icheb in the last 2 seasons. But poor Jennifer was so heartbroken she quit acting, actually went on to become a real Doctor in Real Life.On the other Drone Arm-attachment, this episode carves out Seven-of- Sixty-Nine's transformation from Borg Drone to Quasi-Human.I never really considered Seven as a regular Drone, her first appearance was from a special chamber in The Center of The Cube. It was as if she had been stowed there by The Queen for a special purpose.We think of ""The Queen"" as an Individual, we have to remember her voice is the ONE voice of The Borg, so whatever she says is what The Collective is saying, down to the last Drone. So my hypothesis is that Seven was being groomed to become a third Queen. We've seen the Alpha Queen, Alice Krige and the Beta Queen, Susanna Thompson. Had Seven stayed with The Collective, and her Cube not vaporized by Species 857- 6309, maybe she would become the Delta Queen. She is HUMAN, and The Borg had taken quite an interest in Humans, even recruiting a Borg King, Locutus.And we know that Picard had kept his connection to The Borg even years after his encounter.So The Borg had given Voyager quite a Gift. If you consider this, the title of this Episode takes on a double meaning. Maybe even on some level, The Collective Gave Voyager Seven to help them get through the Delta Quadrant. Otherwise, Voyager would have been Assimilated.So Janeway gets right to work on Seven after The Doc takes out much of her Implants.Meanwhile, Kes is developing some startling Kinetic Powers due to her interaction with Species 857-6309. We saw some of this when Kes came into contact with the Ocampa in the Second Caretaker's Array, but it didn't hold. But now, it is all coming back to her, and she can even reach into Seven's Brain and remove a failing Nano-Implant.She can look down into Matter and see the Quantum beneath the Quantum, or look up at the stars and see the Quantum Above our Quantum. Infinity means just that, there have to be Quantum states below the ones we can now detect, or above our plane of existence. Otherwise, the word ""Infinity"" means nothing.But it is too much for her to control, if she stays on the ship, she could destroy it.Kes Gift to Voyager was a 10,000 light year ride across Borg Space, The Borg's gift to Voyager was Seven.At least this is what I thought when I finally saw Seven, all ""Gussied Up"" to look like a Human, standing next to her Alcove in Cargo bay 2. At least she had Great Implants.What possible use have the Borg for any Human Sexual Traits anyway? When we first saw them and as described by Q, ""Not a man, not a woman"". The Borg use another means for reproduction, even re-creating various Individuals. We know that the Alice Queen was seen in three places, the Susanna Queen on at least two, and in the end we had the Alice Queen to Herald Voyager's Exit from the Delta Quadrant.And at least an episode was written later to have Kes return to Ocampa, even though she had aged too rapidly and became a Bag Lady. But I consider that as the effect of Kes harboring the mind of The Warlord- See the 3rd Season Episode ""Warlord"". His anger is what burned her up and made her age, and after that anger was diffused, maybe the aging effect stopped. But we never got to see that. But it is a viable explanation, as Tuvok told Kes that the effects of her ""adoption"" by the Warlord could not be calculated.",10

This episode accentuates the fact that Kes is developing powers that could destroy Voyager. Seven of Nine is slowly brought back to her human form, losing more and more of her Borgianism.

This was one of my favorite Voyager episode, and it was genuinely emotional (it was also focused on a dialogue between 3 strong and compelling female characters - Janeway, Kes, and Seven). The parallels between Kes and Seven are powerful. While Kes has ended her time on Voyager - and is able to move on to become something ""larger"" - Seven has just begun her journey, on the ship and as an individual. Although others have criticized this episode for effectively ""replacing"" Kes with Seven, I think that was the point. Kes had reached the pinnacle of her individuality, while Seven is only just beginning to become an individual. Seven needs Voyager - she needs the community and support - but Kes does not.All in all, a beautiful episode, and a beautiful goodbye to Jennifer Lien's Kes.",9
8,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Gift (TV Episode 1997)",Janeway of Borg,"The secondary storyline involves Kes leaving the ship because they couldn't handle having so many characters now that they bring in Seven of Nine, and rather than get rid of Neelix, the guy everyone hates, or Harry Kim, the other guy everyone hates whose actor actually can't act, they get rid of Kes.Meanwhile, Seven of Nine discovers she's been disconnected from the Borg Collective. SHe is a prisoner of Captain Janeway of Starfleet. There is no other way to put it.Probably the worst part is that Janeway tries to justify her ill treatment of Seven by claiming that the Borg did it first, and they took her away and stole her identity and assimilated her. In exchange, Janeway says she is giving Seven her old life back.Except she's not, she's FORCING it upon her. Seven of Nine does not want to become her old self again; she wants to return to the Collective. There are plenty of logical reasons not to do so, dealing with security against the Borg, but none of these reasons are addressed even in passing.Seven of Nine was once human, therefore she should become human again. That is the message of this episode and of Janeway.There is actually precedence in this case; when someone abducts a child and raises them as their own. That child cannot simply be torn away from their ""parents"" and given back to their biological parents; this can cause severe emotional distress, and causing them to suffer for the crimes that are entirely the fault of their ""parents"", and not themselves.In the event that the child becomes an adult, they cannot decide at all; the adult can choose their own path.This does not excuse someone kidnapping someone else's child and raising them as their own, but that does not make it in any way legally OR morally acceptable to take a person away from their entire way of life and bring them back to the life they had when they were a child.But since this is Voyager, that's of course the exact RIGHT thing to do, and it all works out in the end and Seven of Nine is happy. It's not a miracle, it's just bad writing!",1
9,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Gift (TV Episode 1997)",7 of 10,"Because the main plot with 7 of 9 is good, but the secondary one with Kes is kind of ridiculous.Janeway makes another controversial, if not downright unethical decision, by forcibly unborging the Borg prisoner against her...their wishes. Disagree as one may with the captain, it makes for an interesting story, helped by Jeri Ryan's fine performance as a confused ex-Borg.Meanwhile, Kes has to leave the show, but that does not mean it has to happen through some Buddhist-like ascension. A couple of episodes of build up do not justify this sudden ""fabulous secret powers were revealed to me"" moment. Sure, she had met other Ocampans who had extensive telekinetic and telepathic powers, but since they had not become Jedi Force ghosts, why should she? Not to mention that only a few episodes before she had grown old and died aboard Voyager without ever acquiring these powers. It's not much to ask for continuity in the space of 6 episodes. Nonetheless, the fact she does leave the ship can't be a bad thing - she was quite decent at the role, but it wasn't really getting anywhere (was Harry Kim getting anywhere though, one might ask).",7

Shortly after they depart the engineering team attempt to open a ""trans-warp conduit"" so they can travel much faster however things go wrong and the ship is forced to dump the unstable warp core leaving it in a worse situation than before. While the crew attempt repairs B'Elanna and Tom take a shuttle to retrieve the core only to find the refugees have already got to it and refuse to give it back. When B'Elanna tries to take it back from them they open fire and both her and Tom are left floating in space with limited oxygen in their space suits... will they be able to survive long enough for Voyager to get repaired and come looking for them?

The key other issue is a race of beggars who want sacrifices from Voyager that will disrupt their intentions. Tom and B'Allana are sent out to get the warp core back which these guys have commandeered.

If not for the convenient diplomatic solution what ending would have come from this? Yeah way to go writers....In truth I wish they ignored or blown their arse out of the water, that might have satisfied me, I hate the way this episode ends. So self righteous and selfless it's rubbish... I'd love to believe that we or anyone would be that way but in truth it's total nonsense.

So, standing around and zapping yourself with pain sticks and other macho Klingon rituals seem stupid to her. As for Seven of Nine, she needs to find a place for herself aboard this new ship. But when she begins working in engineering, a disaster takes place and folks wonder is she might have done this deliberately and she cannot be trusted.

Not good, Not good. Worf would have loved that, but B'Elanna is more like Key'Hlar than Worf. And then she ""alienates"" (Or rather Klingon-ates) Paris who helped her make the Program.Part IIII: ""The Wreckening""Then Seven-of-69's Trans-wart Experiment in Engineering goes haywire and Voyeur's leaky Warp Drive has to be dumped. When B'Elanna and Paris go to pick up the ejected core, the Caatati had already stolen it. Had enough yet, B'Elanna? Nope, cos when they use the shuttle to try to pry the warp core from the Catatonici's ship, the Catatonici reverse the prying-beam on her and it destroys the shuttle, leaving her and Paris drifting around in space with no way to contact Voyeur and just a few hours of air.Part IIIII: ""Seven"" Reasons why you should employ your pet BorgSeven should wear a blue suit with an S on the front. And a cape. Cos the Caatati come back to Voyeur with warp-core in tow intending to Blackmail Janeway with it to get more Sandwiches, and maybe a few cups of Java and some apple pie while they are at it. So Seven figures out a Borg way to give them the ability to feed themselves, so they don't have to panhandle every ship in the Delta Quadrant anymore. So Seven to the Rescue, Everybody Happy Nowadays, and they even get to save B'Elanna and Tom.The End, or not.Not bad, this is the first Voyeur Episode without the benefit of Kes and her Magic Brain-Powers. I think it was a shame letting Jennifer Lien go the way they did, they should have kept both her and Seven. Personally I liked her a lot, and I think she became a very good actress in her last season. But it was the right thing to do to bring Voyager into Borg Space and bring on a Borg Crewoman, and Seven is still part Borg. This allowed her to interact with the Evil Borg Queens, Susanna Thompson and the Big Borg Queen Alice Krige in later episodes. Although I liked Voyager before this change, I liked this change especially as it pumped new life into the series.In B'Elanna's Klingon Brawl Scene, you can't tell the swap between Stuntwoman Leslie Hoffman and Roxann Dawson, they had similar faces, so it looks like B'Elanna all the time. Ironically, in the Deep Space Slime Episode ""What you Leave Behind"" she is the one who took the fall down the stairs when the Jem'Hadar kill off Julianna McCarthy (Garak's Neela).Overall a highly interesting episode this is, it is the first of the Seven vs B'Elanna and B'Elanna vs her Klingon Heritage shows, she has to battle both of them. This is when the dichotomies really start.But on top of that, this episode shows Janeway not thinking straight, acting without weighing all of the potential consequences. See here, Voyager has just survived Species 857-6309 and The Borg. So what does she do after Kes flings them 9,000 Light-Years past the main bulk of Borg Space? She encounters a race of desperate Bag-Ladies who will do anything to survive, and does not consider that they would be hanging around nearby to pick up more crumbs, which they do when they steal Voyager's Warp Drive. And Janeway only sends ONE shuttle to retrieve it, she should have sent at least three.But I suppose if Janeway didn't have lapses in Judgement like this on occasion, there would be no good stories like this.*(Or, is that, ""Roc-Egg Blood Pie""?

I actually like the different speech. It is part of being able to hear how Chakotay is brought into this different world. The more he uses the language the more is on the side of the Vori.(sp?) In the trek universe this could be explained as maybe the universal translators don't always get it 100% how the Federation would speak. Ever try direct translators?There are always wars in modern society and this points out how muddled the picture can get if a complete outsider looks at the scenario. The last several minutes are the best and shows this episode isn't about Chakotay being stranded on a planet. It shows how someone can be influenced and dare I say radicalized. I love that the Cretan ambassador uses the same word for the Vori enemy they have used about them: Nemesis. Both sides (Vori and Cretan) make the same accusations about each other. There is probably some truth to both sides. My favorite quote from Chakotay, ""I wish it were as easy to stop hating as it was to start.""Glimpse again at this one ;)",9

All during this time, Voyager and their crew are looking for Chakotay--with the help of these supposedly ugly, nasty and brutish folks.

Considering the forest setting, the marines and the magineguns, I can only assume this was a tribute, even if the aliens' design had apparently also been used for some other trek race. I only wish someone had had the guts to shout ""get to da shuttle!"".There is of course a twist in the story, which is, in one way or another, expected from the start.All in all, this is an episode that would probably seem incredible if it was used in the Original Series, or the original Twilight Zone, but by the late 90s a bit more than a potent message (it's easier to learn to hate than to forget it) was necessary for it to be memorable.

Messages about the use of one-sided propaganda in a conflict has been done many times, and this is one of those episodes where the writers are fresh out of anything, well, 'fresh'. 10 straight minutes of boring, slow and dark to begin the story doesn't help get the viewer especially involved, either. Maybe I've seen too many Trek episodes, I don't know. How many 'it's been a holo-illusion all along' scripts can one Trekker take?(And on top of all this, it's a shameless rip-off of Predator visuals.)The intent is clear, and the second half gets better, but it's a painful journey.

While eating her first proper meal her Borg personality takes over and she steals a shuttle to head to the source of the signal which triggered her hallucinations.This happens at a rather bad time; Captain Janeway is trying to negotiate passage through B'omar space. These are not a particularly friendly race and are already saying Voyager must take an indirect route through their space to avoid going near any inhabited planet. Not surprisingly they are not happy to have a Borg heading into their space and tell Janeway that Voyager may not enter their space and that they will destroy the shuttle with Seven on board. Never one to give up on a crew member Janeway sends Tuvok and Paris after her. When Tuvok beams over to Seven's shuttle he is captured but manages to gain her confidence and goes with her when they find the source of the Borg signal... a place Seven has been before many years ago.This was a pretty good episode even if the B'omar had an alien-of-the-week feel about them.

The episode touches on several aspects of the adjustment, thrilling the viewer intellectually. and somewhat emotionally. The light scientific discussion of theoretical psychological side effects of once being Borg and being returned to humanity are fun and captivating.There is some nice symbolism, a good bit of action, and a few interesting diplomatic moments.

All of this is going on while the captain is engaged in negotiations that would allow them to navigate through the space claimed by a race (the Bomar) that doesn't like their territory being violated. Seven of Nine then made things worse by taking a shuttle and charging into Bomar space. Needless to say, negotiations come to an end. And everyone is chasing Seven. For different reasons. And seeking different outcomes. We learn more about Sevens family and there's some pretty good action. But the episode is marred by the ridiculous costumes for the Bomar. For some reason, someone thought it would be a good idea to have Bomar costumes include wearing coat hangers on their heads. They're not really coat hangers. But, they do have some kind of silly looking wire head gear wrapped around their heads. Some have colored inserts in ear-like projections that a part of this headgear. For me, every second these people are on screen. It takes away from the overall quality of this episode. I can only imagine how silly the people actually having to wear these costumes must feel.",6

In the midst of the negotiations, she goes nuts, steals a shuttle and goes flying into B'omar space. So much for diplomacy.This is an okay episode of the series.

 I would be more than overjoyed if Seven would refrain from the

 a resting position atop my facial orifice, but let's take it one step 
 at a time.
 
 First we have to teach Sevs how to eat. That's easier than it sounds

 regress/retro-mutate back into her Borg form. (Good thing she didn't 
 try the niblets.)
 
 This week's nightmarish imagery involves Seven's recurring flashback of 
 assimilation accompanied by an ominous raven. Even Harry agrees with 
 me: ""Nightmarish stuff."" The flashbacks get darker, more intense, more 
 inappropriate for Trek until we finally run out of time and decide to 
 call it day. As with most episodes of Voyager you'll want to celebrate 
 afterward by wrapping your lips around a shotgun and blowing a hole out 
 the back of your skull.

0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Scientific Method (TV Episode 1997)",Voyager is invaded in secret by insidious alien medical butchers!,"And for this plucky fan of Star Trek Voyager, it made for one damn good episode. Like The Thaw and Coda before it, Scientific Method is just one of those episodes that is exceptional at being disturbing and creeping you out! It's evident what kind of yarn this is right from the startling anatomical kiss seen during the prologue.(You can actually see the tongue in the cheek that time!) About Voyager say what you will, but when they had a mind to unnerve you they sure came up with the best ideas as far as I'm concerned. I loved how the alien's surgical implants looked like torture devices. It was so strange how the crew couldn't feel the implants or touch them, it set quite a tense and uniquely claustrophobic tone. Also the DNA bar-code thing was different and intriguing. They branded the crew like so much cattle, considering them their property-that is so deliciously inhuman and creepy! The attitude of the aliens was so cold and detached, I think they should have had a more pale, bloodless look, something that really played up to and was a more accurate reflection of what they actually were: mad scientists, psycho surgeons, etcetera. There's no moral dilemma to be found here. The aliens are so utterly heartless and arrogant that they cannot be seen as anything but villains. They made the darn Vidians look wholesome! Why don't they just leave after being revealed instead of threatening to kill everyone? It's a good payoff when one of the alien vessels is destroyed in the climactic action scene, that way at least they didn't get to abuse the crew and just get off scot-free without any kind of payback. There's a lot of stories with paranoids and crazies that believe they they have implants in their teeth and brains, and all the classic tales of UFO aliens conducting secret experiments on people, and I think this episode kind of plays up to some of that. As much as I enjoy this episode, which is quite a bit, I like it slightly better in the first half that leads up to the point where Seven-of-Nine grabs one of the aliens, then the tone of everything changes. Seven's altered vision that reveals the hovering aliens reminded me a lot of the movie ""They Live."" The few brief glimpses of skinless crew members also looked a lot like the aliens out of that movie:::2::: Janeway is f*****g nuts! Love it! You can tell something must be seriously wrong right off, when you see that a few strands of her hair are ever so slightly out of place... I love Kate Mulgrew playing a different captain than what we're used to. The frazzled complexion and lack of makeup really help convey a woman not far from a nervous breakdown. The scene where she blasts Tom and B'Elanna is simply hilarious. B'Elanna looks so hurt. There is nothing so precious as a reprimand from Captain Janeway. To me, everything she rants at them translates as: ""If the captain can't get any, neither can you! Dismissed!"" You half-expect giant fireballs to erupt from Janezilla's eyeballs and incinerate the two at any moment. I also really like a scene a little later where Tuvok is concerned about the captain. He really does care about her deeply. I like that. He's there for her-Aww! The best part is when the captain steps over the dead crewman, takes the helm and flies the ship between the two pulsars. Probably complete bogus, but it sure made for one thrilling and great finale to the story. This is one of the best ever scary episodes and one of my personal favourites of season the fourth. Thank you much.",8

These are minor concerns compared to what happens later to Chakotay and Neelix who find they are changing at a genetic level, it is assumed the causes are natural until the Doctor discovers an obviously artificial marker in Chakotay's genetic code. No sooner has he learnt this than his program starts deleting and B'Elanna, who he was working with collapses. Before he is deleted he manages to transfer his program to the holodeck from where he contacts Seven. After adjusting Seven's Borg sensors she is able to see previously unseen aliens aboard Voyager who appear to be performing experiments on the crew. Now she must find a way to expose them without them realise she can see them.This was another fairly good episode centred on Seven, clearly the writers are giving her plenty of episodes so fans will get used to the new crew member.

When investigating, Torres and the Doctor realize that there is some alien presence aboard--and it seems to be the source of the problems. But, Torres and the Doc are disabled by the force before they can alert anyone! However, the Doctor, while disabled, is able to send himself into a holodeck and contacts Seven of Nine. Can she manage to help him determine who is doing these awful things to the crew, why and manage to get them off the ship?This is a very creepy and original episode.

Very well done!Janeway got the best line as well: ***SPOILERS*** ""These lab rats are fighting back"". Captain Janeway played the migraine afflicted captain very well, being irritated about everything and losing her cool, and her solution to the problem had her kicking ass all over the place.The Tom Paris/B'Ellana Torres romance got kicked into high gear as well, which brought some entertaining character developments, and the doctor and 7 had some good moments as well.",9

These several markers are doing different things to the crew. They are becoming ill, aging, dying. The Captain is in a horrible mood and is taking no prisoners. One thing, the appearance of Seven has really uplifted the series. She works in tandem with the Doc here as they try to see into what the alien presence is doing. Next to the Borg.

5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Scientific Method (TV Episode 1997)",Voyager Twist to Some TNG Plot Recycling,"Oh Star Trek, how I love you, but after watching nearly every single episode of every incarnation, you start to notice not just a few episodes share very similar plots. It is fantastic in a sense as each show had to produce 20+ episodes a season and we were not in the singular season arc most contemporary shows such as Game of Thrones, Arrowverse, and the sort currently produce. Different facets of humanity were explored or actors were permitted to explore their characters and experiment with their own acting abilities. This episode is strongly reminiscent of the TNG episode ""Schisms"", which was also creepy in its own right. Kudos to the writers for giving thought to individual story lines such as Seven continuing to learn about working in a hierarchy or Tom and B'Lanna pursuing their relationship. Both Schisms and Scientific Method treat the episodes as mysteries, with the crew finding a way to counter the threat by relying on each other's unique abilities to save the day. When I was younger, as much as we love Trek or even hero-worship, it made me wonder if similar events happen to other species' crews and if they were equally successful? I think my younger self was beginning to find certain episodes where the crew always have a convenient solution to an uncanny problem a bit too convenient. Its like every superhero movie every made: villain wants to destroy Earth, hero saves the day, gets the girl. Especially in these Marvel and DC expanded universe times, if you have seen it at least 5 times with 5 different heroes, you kind of have seen it all. :) Now that I am older and am coming around to watching Voyager again for the second (or third) time, I see that each show's crew has a higher chance of several because of the unique traits each character possesses. A purely human, Vulcan, Klingon ship may also find success, but not as quickly as the TOS, TNG, DS9, VOY, or ENT crews. In this case, had Seven not been on board, it might have been possible to adjust the doctor's field of vision as in the episode ""Displaced"", but Seven seems to be a more convenient choice. Star Trek's core message of inclusion and celebration of diversity rings true even here, without the straightforward, written message directed at audiences. As a species, we are more likely to survive and evolve if we treasure each other and rely on each other. As much as I don't like plot recycling, it was a decent episode focusing on how Voyager's crew handles similar experimentation as TNG once did. Oddly enough, I don't remember a similar episode in DS9, but I could be wrong! Enjoy!",7

The ship belongs to the Krenim a race that are at war with another race called the Zahl. Voyager enters the war zone but does not realise what is happening as each time change also changes their memories; they just think they are running from the Krenim and taking heavy damage. As the days pass life on board gets harder and harder, most decks are unusable and the survivors are just trying survive one day at a time. Their luck changes when one of the Krerim's temporal weapons fails to explode, this enables seven to gain enough information to modify the shields to block the weapons; it has another effect when the Kremin change history the crew of Voyager remember what things were before so realise that somebody is going about changing history. The problem is it might be too late to use this knowledge.This was a great episode which is possibly the darkest episode of the series to date, by the time the words ""to be continued"" appear on the screen the ship is battered and most of the crew have been forced to abandon ship. As well as the regular cast Robocop's bad guy Kurtwood Smith appears the the captain of the Krenim's temporal weapon.",9
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Year of Hell (TV Episode 1997)",Massively inconsistent with storyline,"This was a really good action packed two part story except for the fact that it couldn't possibly have happened. First mistake, in the season 3 episode ""Before and After"" Kes warns Janeway of the Krenim and provides information about their capabilities and information on how to deal with them yet neither Janeway or any member of the crew seems to recall this and there is no incident in any episode to explain this glaring inconsistency. Second mistake, during ""Before and After"" it was specifically stated that Voyager would encounter the Krenim in 11 months yet the Krenim were on the other side of Borg space and the only reason they got there within the time frame specified was because Kes managed to send them 9500 light years (10 years travel) closer to earth in a matter of moments during her transformation as her ""gift"" to them and since she clearly didn't transform in ""Before and After"" there is no explanation how they managed to travel such a substantial distance in such a short time. I suppose there are plenty of potential explanations like they managed to find a wormhole or the Borg had them travel in a trans-warp conduit to traverse their space more quickly but how events could have been so different this time is a mystery. So there are two possibilities either someone dropped the ball on checking for plot consistency or they knew it was inconsistent and simply didn't care enough to try to make it consistent.",
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Year of Hell (TV Episode 1997)","Not exactly the usual touchy-feely sort of ""Voyager"" episode....","The vast majority of the episodes of ""Star Trek: Voyager"" are very politically correct and nice. Again and again, the ship avoids battles and acts almost like a galactic team of social workers-- often helping various races as they travel the galaxy. Some might really like this but I have always thought this was the weakest of the Trek series because it was so nice and non-confrontational much of the time. So, because of this, it's good to see episodes like ""Year of Hell""--ones which are chock full of violence, explosions and death!The show begins as Voyager is about to enter Krenim space. The Krenim seem like an incredibly unfriendly and nasty race. They refuse to allow the ship to pass and threaten to destroy Voyager-- though their ships seem insignificant. At the same time, you see a Krenim crew traveling about the system. They are a temporal ship and are trying to change history by selectively wiping out species-- literally erasing evidence they even existed in the first place. Soon the attacks on Voyager jump in intensity and the ship is under almost constant attacks. Many crew members are killed, decks destroyed and the ship is a complete mess. By the end of the episode, Voyager is virtually destroyed and the Captain orders most of the crew to abandon ship!So, you've got TONS of action, lots of violence and an engaging plot. So, this apparently is not ""Star Trek: Voyager""....or at least not much like most of the episodes. Well worth seeing though you do realize as you watch that by the end of episode 2 that this all MUST be undone because the show cannot continue in this vein.",10
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Year of Hell (TV Episode 1997)","This is not ""Voyager""","This review applies to both episodes of this 2-parter Who wrote this two-part episode and why? A gritty and compelling story with a slight minimum of technobabble, a genuine sense of loss in that it's not just nameless goldshirts who can die or be seriously wounded, and an antagonist who is not a typical ""bad guy"" but actually a well-rounded, fully fleshed out person whose motives are driven solely by a desire to bring back his family, friends, and his people from mishaps he was responsible for, while being flawed enough to sacrifice entire races in order to do so? This is not typical ""Voyager"", but no worries; the show soon returns to the formula of mediocrity and stupidity it's so well known for. But for two weeks, we get a story that lives up to its title as it flashes forward from ""Day 1"" to ""Day 4"", ""Day 39"", ""Day 70"", ""Day 180"", etcetera in chronicling a *SHOCK!* REALISTIC depiction of a spaceship pursuing another through space and waging a bloody guerrilla-style war that sees Voyager slowly come apart, characters die or be maimed, and personalities clash.There's still moments of stupidity, such as Tuvok claiming that there is an accepted addage amongst the Federation that ""The Captain is always right"", but for the most part, everything comes across wholly real, and very much as though Voyager were a small town under siege by an enemy, with the once pristine hallways and decks becoming smoldering shades of dark gray and blue as power fluctuates, decks are destroyed piecemeal, and places like the mess hall become medical facilities, and a big-ass piece of debris is stuck through the bridge.The antagonist, meanwhile, is of the Krenim race. Spoilers abounding.It starts with the Krenim attacking and threatening Voyager for intruding into their space, while Annorax (Kurtwood Smith) commands a gigantic ship with the ability to use time travel technobabble to alter aspects of things from molecules to planets in terms of time. So he uses this to eliminate an entire species on a planet, then observes how the timeline is affected, while he and his ship is protected from these changes.Turns out, the Krenim were involved in a hideously violent war against a superior species that it was losing. Annorax then invented this time ship and used it to wipe out this species. The timeline then sets itself so that the Krenim are suddenly a superpower... and people begin dying by the millions from a disease that this other species had cured for the Krenim generations earlier.So he attempts more and more time incursions to mess with the timeline, and as a result, accidentally wipes out the vast majority of the Krenim nation, as well as his own wife and children. He spends 200 years constantly attempting to change time enough to set things back the way they were, or possibly better.They take aboard Chakotay and Tom Paris, and begin working together to try to undo the damage, and set Voyager fine as it was in before the Krenim met them.Of course, the ""Magic Reset Button"" must come into effect for a show like ""Voyager"", and everything ends up reset the way it was at ""Day 1"", but the difference becoming that the Krenim do not attack Voyager outright, but acknowledge them, and politely tell them to avoid their space.The only problem I saw is that Annorax was apparently still alive, at his home, working on the time ship. But in the prior episode, it was said he had spent 200 years messing with the timeline. So was this a flashback or a continuity error? Either way, an odd change of pace from typical Voyager stupidity, and even though the Magic Reset Button came into effect, it wasn't done as stupidly as it could have been.",8
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Year of Hell (TV Episode 1997)",Very good ep. But imo its flawed with mistakes,"Unless this ep takes place in another dimension, it is seriously flawed.First, Kes told all about the krenim and there fotons in the episode were she is warping thru time cause she was exposed to the radiation from the krenim fotons. Also in that episode were she is dieing of old age, seven of nine is not present anywhere. So in that time frame, they didn't come across the borg. But they did come across the borg and picked up seven. They also already knew the exect specs of the fotons, 1.47, Kes told them already. but now seven gets them instead. So i guess kes hasn't existed in that time, meaning kes never communicated with species 9472. Voyager never helped the borg and seven couldn't be on voyager. Also if kes hasn't been on voyager, Tom should be more knowledged on being a ""nurse"".Captein Janeway also says on a point to the krenim ship that she is 65k lightyears from home. They were 70k when they first arrived in the delta quadrant, so they only traveled 5k in 3 years. But this is plausible, since kes never gave the ""gift"" of 10k lightyears cause she never existed.Its not fun to play with time, it messes things up so much.Everything is plausible in this episode, but all the prev episodes are from a whole other ship.",8
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Year of Hell (TV Episode 1997)",It's About Time,"Of course, in a previous episode, Kes warned about the Krenim and their destructive forces. Now this race, led by an obsessed man, is moving across the galaxy, eliminating societies and planets by using time to make it so they never existed. Unfortunately, Voyager gets in the way and annoys the zealot. Soon most of the ship is blown away. Paris and Chakotay have been beamed aboard the ship and are in discourse with the leader.",10
6,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Year of Hell (TV Episode 1997)",Excellent Temporal Causality Loop Episode,"This episode was previewed in ""Before and After"" -But we really get to see the results of the Krenim's Time-Incursions here, in this excellent 2-parter.Some say that 7-of-69 being there instead of Kes, is some kind of Inconsistency, but it really is not, if you consider the entire storyline - These Krenim are changing TIME. Ergo, they must have been changing time for the entire Voyager series, up to now. Therefore, we got to see a version of Year of Hell where Kes discovered the time displacement instead of 7-of-69. But since then, the Krenim's own meddling has changed that original story, and this is completely consistent with ""Before and After"".The Kremin attack Voyager with Torpedoes which have a time variance, much the same as how the Enterprise D destroyed the Microcentrum Lifeforms on Dividia Two. Voyager must needs make a defense against these, and this required someone to see one of these torpedoes and scan it with a tricorder. In Before and After, this was Kes. Here, it is 7- of-69.But the result is the same - After Voyager is protected from further Timeline Incursions, their internal Timeline remains the same. This prevents Janeway and Torres from being killed in this version of events.Kurtwood Smith is 'Annorax"" - a Krenim Time-Scientist who has been performing these Incursions for 200 Years - But he has an ulterior, personal Motive. I suppose this story is much like ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" where Annorax becomes Nemo as well, as well as ""Captain Bligh"" - There is a very Nautical Theme underlying these episodes.Another thing we can discard as ""Inconsistency"" is that if Annorax was doing this for 200 years, he may indeed have started sometime after the very last scene in this two-parter. He could have built his Time Weapon at any moment after the Magic Reset Button Phenomenon. But the ending of this dual episode shows, maybe he made a different decision within that timeframe- And this explains how he could have been doing it for 200 years of his internal time, because the Time Weapon was not existing and operating within our concept of time. What I garner from the ending, is that he decided not to build it in the first place. So, he built it but he also did not build it. Quantum Theory explains how both and neither could have happened. In the Original Trek Universe, Timeline Incursions always get the ""Magic Reset Button"". It is only since 2009's Trek, where the changes were not set back. This same concept was used in Fringe Season 4. But time always has some kind of ""Rubber band Effect"" where at least one person becomes aware of changes - In Next Generation, this was Guinan, in Fringe, it was Peter Bishop.But we can see here, not all of the Voyager timeline was reset back to Pre 7-of-69. If that had happened, then 7-of-69 would not have been on Voyager, and Kes would have returned. Obviously, this could not happen because Jennifer Lien had been unceremoniously and cruelly FIRED from Voyager, which caused that actress to quit acting.This is how Politics can affect Time.",10
7,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Year of Hell (TV Episode 1997)","Great episodes, despite inconsistencies","I understand all the previous reviews, and simply put, it is inconsistent with previous episodes. The first thing I noticed was that Janeway didn't remember Kes warning her about the ""year of hell"" and the Krenim torpedo time-phase. She would have remembered! Unless something radical had changed, but it obviously didn't because one of those torpedos got stuck in the hull the same as it did in the original 'future' episode ... don't know how they missed that one. They did show some differences, like some anonymous yellow-suit dieing instead of Belana, but it still doesn't show the magnitude of difference that would have occurred from Kes not being there, and 7 of 9 being there, for serious. And the fact that the time wave affected the WHOLE of reality when it first struck - and the Voyager crew thus had no knowledge of it - but when it passed over them again (at the very end of the second and concluding episode), they were restored to full, beautiful Voyager integrity, but without the memory loss. Capt. Janeway knows full well the entire saga of what just happened.I'm sure there are plenty of inconsistency s I haven't mentioned, but regardless, I think these were GREAT episodes. I loved them! I felt heart and soul here. And, if ever Kate Mulgrew could be accused of over-acting, it was appropriate here.",8
8,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Year of Hell (TV Episode 1997)",Excellent in spite of the colossal plot hole,"As everyone except the show writers has noticed, Kes had warned them about the Krenim, and no one remembers it - it is a continuous problem that events of past episodes often are not reflected in the next ones, but this is the proverbial elephant in the room. The episode ""Before and After"" specifically foreshadowed the events here, yet it is like it never happened (huh...).Nonetheless, if you forget this glaring error, the episode is great, both in its depiction of a ravaged Voyager and for introducing a villain who appears to have some depth and character - as well as a megalomania that will obviously be his undoing.",9

0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Year of Hell: Part II (TV Episode 1997)","Voyager at its gritty, beautiful best","Star Trek Voyager series 4 would be blessed with many great episodes such as 'Scorpion part 2', fan favourite 'Message in a bottle', and 'The Gift'. By far the best episodes of the series were, however, 'Year of Hell' parts 1 & 2. It showed a nasty, dark side to star trek that had rarely been seen before, and was beautifully acted by nearly everyone. The premise is simple: A temporal ship tries to erase everything to rectify a mistake made in the past. Enter the 'Krenim', a wonderful new species full of temporal programmers, under the rule of a distraught captain trying to restore the glory of his species and bring back his lost wife. In entering Krenim space, Voyager will become critically damaged, eventually being evacuated apart from senior officers. This leads to a beautiful scene on the Bridge where Janeway evacuates everyone, with protest from Tuvok, and finally drives Voyager to its death into the Krenim ship. Obviously, Voyager cannot finish at this point, and the only thing letting down the episode is that fact that the ending comes far to quickly and easily, and is a let-down compared to the rest of the episode. However, the way this episode is shot, the sense of fear and terror that runs through it is magnificent and not something you would expect from Star Trek. A stand-out episode in a stand-out series.",10

After the evacuation of Voyager only the senior staff remain on board, although from the viewers point of view that just means there are no nameless background characters wandering around the corridors. Heavily damaged Janeway has taken Voyager into a nebula so they can make repairs and make a plan for confronting the Krenim's temporal weapon. Meanwhile aboard the weapon Chakotay and Paris have different ideas about how they can help Voyager; Chakotay thinks that by using the weapon they can make it so that Voyager never approaches Krenim space whereas Tom thinks any adjustment of time is wrong and they should try to ferment mutiny amongst the crew. We also learn Annorax's real motive for constantly changing time; he just wants to correct a mistake which lead to the loss of his wife. Obviously the crew of the Voyager find a way to repair time but I won't spoil how they do it.This was another exciting episode where the crew actually get hurt, including the captain who is badly scarred in a fire. It was just a shame the story couldn't have been stretched a bit longer as it was good to see the usually pristine Voyager battle-scared.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Year of Hell: Part II (TV Episode 1997)","This is not ""Voyager""","This review applies to both episodes of this 2-parter Who wrote this two-part episode and why? A gritty and compelling story with a slight minimum of technobabble, a genuine sense of loss in that it's not just nameless goldshirts who can die or be seriously wounded, and an antagonist who is not a typical ""bad guy"" but actually a well-rounded, fully fleshed out person whose motives are driven solely by a desire to bring back his family, friends, and his people from mishaps he was responsible for, while being flawed enough to sacrifice entire races in order to do so? This is not typical ""Voyager"", but no worries; the show soon returns to the formula of mediocrity and stupidity it's so well known for. But for two weeks, we get a story that lives up to its title as it flashes forward from ""Day 1"" to ""Day 4"", ""Day 39"", ""Day 70"", ""Day 180"", etcetera in chronicling a *SHOCK!* REALISTIC depiction of a spaceship pursuing another through space and waging a bloody guerrilla-style war that sees Voyager slowly come apart, characters die or be maimed, and personalities clash.There's still moments of stupidity, such as Tuvok claiming that there is an accepted addage amongst the Federation that ""The Captain is always right"", but for the most part, everything comes across wholly real, and very much as though Voyager were a small town under siege by an enemy, with the once pristine hallways and decks becoming smoldering shades of dark gray and blue as power fluctuates, decks are destroyed piecemeal, and places like the mess hall become medical facilities, and a big-ass piece of debris is stuck through the bridge.The antagonist, meanwhile, is of the Krenim race. Spoilers abounding.It starts with the Krenim attacking and threatening Voyager for intruding into their space, while Annorax (Kurtwood Smith) commands a gigantic ship with the ability to use time travel technobabble to alter aspects of things from molecules to planets in terms of time. So he uses this to eliminate an entire species on a planet, then observes how the timeline is affected, while he and his ship is protected from these changes.Turns out, the Krenim were involved in a hideously violent war against a superior species that it was losing. Annorax then invented this time ship and used it to wipe out this species. The timeline then sets itself so that the Krenim are suddenly a superpower... and people begin dying by the millions from a disease that this other species had cured for the Krenim generations earlier.So he attempts more and more time incursions to mess with the timeline, and as a result, accidentally wipes out the vast majority of the Krenim nation, as well as his own wife and children. He spends 200 years constantly attempting to change time enough to set things back the way they were, or possibly better.They take aboard Chakotay and Tom Paris, and begin working together to try to undo the damage, and set Voyager fine as it was in before the Krenim met them.Of course, the ""Magic Reset Button"" must come into effect for a show like ""Voyager"", and everything ends up reset the way it was at ""Day 1"", but the difference becoming that the Krenim do not attack Voyager outright, but acknowledge them, and politely tell them to avoid their space.The only problem I saw is that Annorax was apparently still alive, at his home, working on the time ship. But in the prior episode, it was said he had spent 200 years messing with the timeline. So was this a flashback or a continuity error? Either way, an odd change of pace from typical Voyager stupidity, and even though the Magic Reset Button came into effect, it wasn't done as stupidly as it could have been.",8

In the Trek shows, two-part episodes usually are more violent and exciting than normal, but this one is even more so.When the last episode ended, Paris and Chakotay were taken prisoner by a temporal ship run by a Captain Ahab-like guy, Annorax. Annorax is trying to change time in order to undo horrible things his ship did hundreds of years ago. Since one of the ship's first acts accidentally resulted in erasing all memory of Annorax's family, he's been making changes in time again and again and again--all in an attempt to undo his earlier change. But each change ends up causing more havoc and erasing various species. Clearly Annorax and his crew are playing god! In the meantime, Voyager is a mess with a skeleton crew of only about a half dozen. Given its condition, there seems to be no way they'll ever make it back to the Delta Quadrant--let alone survive more than a few months at best.Can all this somehow be undone? Well of course--because this went on for seven seasons! Because of this, the viewer KNOWS all this will somehow get undone--a weakness in this show. But given the action and the complexity of Annorax as a villain, it's very much worth seeing and a nice change from the usually too nice episodes of the series.",8

Shockingly B'Elanna is charged with having violent thoughts and is sentenced to have those thoughts erased. While the local law enforcers believe it to be an open and shut case Tuvok is not so sure; especially when a murder occurs which was apparently caused by B'Elanna's thoughts despite her being in custody. Having other ideas he beams down to the surface and conducts his own investigation.While not as exciting as the previous episode this was still fairly good while idea of a Star Trek crew accidentally breaking unexpected local laws isn't new it was fairly well handled... and makes one thankful that our thoughts can't be seen by others.",7
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Random Thoughts (TV Episode 1997)","More ""Voyager"" stupidity!","Once again, coming hot off the heels of an excellent bunch of episodes in the ""Year of Hell"", we return to typical Voyager stupidity and mediocrity.This one, however, much like others, is one in which an average episode is completely undermined by an ass-backwards way of thinking that the Voyager writers seem to have that seems to confuse ""tolerance"" and ""enlightened thinking"" with ""bending over backwards and letting other people walk all over us"" See, in this episode, they go to a planet full of telepaths, and some random guy accidentally steps on Torres's foot. Some time later, this guy beats a man to death, and later, they arrest Torres, because apparently she thought a violent thought when the man stepped on her foot. A violent thought that was entirely visceral, coming from her subconscious, as she quickly mentally forgave him when he said it was an accident.Of course, this doesn't stop them, because apparently this thought is contagious, and could lead to violence throughout their world. So, in true ""1984""-style Thought Crime fashion, they root out people who have bad thoughts, and give them a mental ""purging"" of their violent thoughts. This is repeatedly compared with lobotomizing by many characters.So they plan on putting Torres through this rather than imprisoning her, after the main female guest star leader person smugs it up and calls us low, primitive creatures for imprisoning people.Tuvok, because he's not that much of an idiot, suspects shenanigans, and slowly discovers that there's a black market of violent thoughts---people selling violent thoughts for fun, because they are forbidden. Tuvok eventually shares some of his own in exchange for the lead black market guy turning himself in to save Torres.Then the very end is where the episode derails from the tracks of good and moral thinking and becomes the puddle of stupid that makes it seem that the writers of this episode thought ""1984"" to be a cute little read, but nothing at all serious; Seven of Nine confronts Janeway in that direct, Borg way of hers, saying it was unacceptable for her to be following Starfleet regulation in such a way that nearly got TWO of her high-ranking officers killed. Janeway says this was a GOOD thing, because exploration and first contact is in their nature, and that they must learn about new cultures and their ways and respect them in order to learn more, and in this way they can learn to better understand and tolerate civilizations they encounter in the future.No Janeway, you must not.In this case, the brutal, tyrannic crackdown on violent thoughts lead to one crewmember nearly being murdered by black market thugs, and another nearly being subjected to a serious mind-invasive procedure that could have produced any number of unknowable side effects on someone of a completely different species.The worst part is that they learn NOTHING from this except paranoia. Not only was Torres's violent thought UNINTENTIONAL, but it's something that ALL humans and humanoids like Klingons and Romulans and perhaps even Vulcans can have happen to them when caught off-guard by someone seemingly stupid.So because of their insane level of political correctness and fetish for tolerance, the Captain and the writers of ""Voyager"" take on an attitude that is the equivalent of tolerating the prosecution of ""thought crimes"" as displayed in the book ""1984"" Only it's EVEN WORSE because in this society, you are still prosecuted for UNINTENTIONAL thoughts! As someone who has very frequent obsessive thoughts, I would likely have been lobotomized every few days if I lived in a society like this, because I have thoughts I do not like and cannot completely do away with or control the way these people claim to do.Way to fail, ""Voyager"" ""All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing"" - Edmund Burke",1

First of all, the self righteousness of the investigator is sickening. She believes things that are not in evidence. She is ready to torture a person from another culture who has no experience with the world. Janeway is as ridiculous as I've ever seen her, and she has done so many stupid things to counteract the voyage home that I've lost track. It's so interesting that this race is deserving of respect but have no respect for the beliefs and actions of the visiting cultures. This is an idiotic contrivance.

They follow the ships to a planet and when Janeway and Tukok beam down to the surface they are surprised to find Leonardo there using the Doctor's emitter. They manage to find a few other minor items but it turns out the computer core is hidden in a shielded warehouse so Janeway and Leonardo must break to steal it back.This episode wasn't one of the best as we didn't really get to know the alien who stole Voyager's equipment, instead it concentrated on the character of Leonardo who spent most of his time getting excited about the high-tech equipment, John Rhys-Davies was a bit hammy in the role but that did bring some humour to the part.",7
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Concerning Flight (TV Episode 1997)",Gimli the Dwarf in America,"What was great about Voyager, and Most Treks, was that they had a great Script Supervisor, Cosmo Genevese, whose credits go all the way back to Perry Mason. We know that certain Characters in Trek Episodes of the '90's are named after beloved Crew, Kivas Fajo from The Next Generation episode ""The Most Toys"" was named after Lolita Fatjo (Who I met along with Patrick Stewart at the Creation Trek Convention in San Diego in 1993). The job of the Script Supervisor is to worm out inconsistencies and even keep track of things that occur from episode to episode. Cosmo's episodes of Voyager are always totally and internally consistent with The Trek Universe, and Cosmo himself was honored in the episode ""Non-Sequitor"" as the Alien Caretaker of Harry, ""Cosimo"".In this episode, his work is evident in the Tech used by some intergalactic criminals and thieves, in S3e24 of Voyager, a race of alien chumps ""displace"" the crew of Voyager with a trick gadget.A Translocator. At the start of this, Janeway is helping Gimli, Er, Leonardo Da Vinci (John Reese-Davies) perfect his ""Flying Machine"" and they fall into the Arno River much to Leo's Chagrin.As he packs for a Holographic visit to France, Voyager is attacked, and when the shields go down, these double headed hi-brow Ugly Alien Crooks Translocate a whole Stewpot of Tech from Voyager right under their nose, including The Doc's Mobile Emitter and even the running Da Vinci Program.The Crippled Voyager, sans the Main Majel Barret-Roddenberry Voiced Computer limps into ""Genoa"" at Impulse, taking them 10 days to get there.When Janeway and Tuvok beam down who do they run Into but Leonardo, who is buying a Plasma Shunt ripped off straight from Voyager from a crook, so he can make ""Mercury run in 3 directions"".Leonardo becomes Janeway's ""Inside Renaissance Man"" in more ways than I can count. Of all the guest stars of Voyager this is perhaps my favorite, and one of my favorite JR-D roles as well, other than Gimli and Treebeard in LOTR.John Vargas is ""Tau"", Leonardo's new ""Patron"", and he has several ""Fortresses"" on the planet filled with stolen Booty. All Janeway is interested in is their Main Computer Core, which is hidden in one of these.Leonardo becomes Janeway's main gateway into these fortresses, his talents with Cartography give Janeway a most precise map of the region, which Seven of 69 uses to locate the Main Computer Core. He even starts drawing Tuvok's Ears.Not only is the Leonardo Simulation incredibly funny, there are some wonderful strains of Music that play whenever he is in the scene.This episode could have been expanded to a double Episode and we could have seen more of Paris', Neelix's and Chakotay's exploits on the other continent, as it is, their involvement is limited to a scene with Donald Pugsley as an Alien Buyer, Chakotay tells him ""These Colours look good on you"" (And they did).Leonardo helps them get back the Core, Leo thinks there is a magical woman in a box. And Leo also gives Janeway the means to effect escape from ""America"" with his new ""Flying Machine"" which is actually a Hang Glider- The ""Portuguese Ship"" (aka Voyager) scoops (Beams) them up and takes them back to ""Florence"" (Cargo Bay 2/The Holodeck).One Wonders if a man like Leonardo Da Vinci could adapt to being Shanghaied to America, or the 24th Century. The Simulation had no problems interacting with his Patron and crooked merchants, and he had already made a connection to ""Katrina Janeway"". This concept is explored in this episode, to the maximum John Reese Davies could make us really Believe it.As Leo Quotes, ""Monstrous and Wonderful are the peoples of Undiscovered lands"".",10
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Concerning Flight (TV Episode 1997)",Kinda dumb.....Janeway hangs out with DaVinci.,"When the show begins, a group of small spacecraft buzz around Voyager and uses beams to steal various stuff from the ship. I was confused by this, as normally on the show, you CAN'T beam things through the shields. Regardless, some of the stuff is very important--such as the Doctor's mobile emitter (which allows him to leave the sick bay) and the ship's computer! So Janeway and Tuvok beam down to a nearby planet to see if they can find any traces of their stuff.Up until this point, the show is pretty good. However, once on the planet it gets pretty dumb. Apparently the mobile emitter is being used by Leonardo DaVinci--the version that came from the holodeck! He apparently works for the guy responsible for the thefts. So, he and Janeway go on an adventure together to save the day.The idea of DaVinci running about with Janeway is amazingly dumb and a bit embarrassing. John Rhys-Davies is kind of fun in the role and hams it up good. But the whole pairing is just insane and the escape using DaVinci's flying machine made me cringe. There are also some odd inconsistencies--things that just don't make a lot of sense. Why do the Voyager crew try not take back everything that was stolen? Why not punish them or at least make it so they cannot keep attacking and stealing from passing ships? And, most importantly, why take time out from running away from the baddies to dialog with DaVinci? Couldn't you just do this LATER on the ship?!

First of all, one has to really question the whole concept of this component of a fantasy world. It's neat they have it, but is it within the bounds of imagination, at least as sophisticated as this.

Here there is the feeling that Neelix is experiencing the loss of his soul - he has been brought back to life, but feels like an automaton.As Bryan Fuller is the writer, the quality of the script is very high. Overall though, the story has a somewhat constrained use of the crew and is maybe not as good as some of the other episodes in this excellent season for that reason, but interesting nonetheless as an early piece of work by this marvellous writer.",9
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Mortal Coil (TV Episode 1997)",A crisis of faith,Whether or not you like this episode will probably come down to whether or not you like Neelix as he is the centre of attention. What should have been a routine mission to collect protomatter from a nebula ends badly for Neelix when he is killed. By the time his body has been returned to Voyager eighteen hours have passed; much too long for the Doctor to attempt to heal him. Seven of Nine says that she knows how to cure him using her Borg knowledge. This is successful but when Neelix returns to life he has a crisis of faith because while dead he did not experience the Talaxian afterlife and grows to believe he is not meant to be alive any more. As well as Neelix's faith we get a good insight into Seven's views on mortality and how that has changed since leaving the Borg Collective.While this episode didn't feature much action it had a decent story and tackled a subject I wouldn't have expected. Ethan Phillips did well portraying the usually jovial Neelix as a more conflicted character than we are used to.,7

She is successful and everyone is happy. Neelix, after a while, isn't. After all, during the time he was dead he never experienced what he thought Talaxian heaven should be. He remembers nothing...and this creates a big crisis of faith. Later, with the help of Chakotay, he goes on a 'vision quest' and learns nothing to make him feel better. For Neelix, life sucks and he feels no reason to go on- -so he begins saying his goodbyes but the crew is apparently too dim to realize that he's about to off himself. Can he be saved from himself?The idea of a crisis of faith is excellent for the show. But why does every single problem get met with Chakotay and his pseudo- American Indian mumbo-jumbo?! The ship could really use a minister, rabbi, witch doctor, priest, guru, imam or whatever and it does seem odd that on the Trek shows there isn't someone to go to for spiritual advice other than the second in command!So is all this any good? It all depends. I wanted Neelix to stay dead, but that's just my bias against Neelix since I find him a bit annoying. Others, however, might like this one more than I did.",5

He then looses his faith because he realizes that the Talaxian afterlife is a lie. His reaction to this news is typical to any brainwashed individual: he panics, he's hysterical and loses the will to go on with his life.Another very low charisma character that I personally dislike - Chakotay - comes with his ""tools"" and the spiritual rambling commences. Near the end of the episode Chakotay says to him that the absence of any kind of afterlife can lead to a stronger faith. What?! Not only it doesn't make any sense, but one would think that a 24th century Starfleet officer would slap that clown (Neelix) on the head and ask him to stop believing non-sense suited for children that can't sleep.It's true that Star Trek is not about only science but also about human condition, ethics (not morality), adventure, etc. but it is certainly not about religion, spirituality (what is that by the way?) and superstition.

What a startling set of events. The Doctor and Seven, (and probably Tuvok) would be the ones on the crew that would express concerns about the body but not the soul.

Deep, deep, deep space for Voyager, as it's in the Alpha Quadrant. It seems that some aliens built a bunch of cell towers in space and Voyager tries to use them to send a voicemail home. When that doesn't work, they send The Doctor, because why not? It makes perfect sense - a simple sound file can't get through thousands of light years without degradation, but one of the most complex computer files in existence works like a charm.The Doctor then appears in the pristine sickbay of a brand new Starfleet ship, only to find that some dirty, stinking Romulans have already stolen it and are headed back to Romulus, no doubt to stir up some trouble in years to come.So it's up to Dr. Sourpuss to convince that ship's new and improved (debatable) EMH to stage an insurrection and retake the ship so that they can alert Starfleet so that the Doc can get home so that Voyager can know that Starfleet knows they're still alive. A lot of work, but the payoff is nice, as our crew finally has some hope. Not gonna lie - got a teensy bit emotional when the Doc gives Janeway Starfleet's message - ""you're not alone."" Though, Voyager might just want to stay in the Delta Quadrant once they learn Andy Dick is the new space doctor.",7
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Message in a Bottle (TV Episode 1998)",A fun episode!,"Wow...talk about a strange but funny episode! This one is worth seeing and different. It begins with Seven of Nine discovering a communications array. Her thoughts are that it could be used to possibly communicate with the Alpha Quadrant by sending the Doctor to a Federation ship. The problem is that the USS Prometheus turns out to be a ship that was hijacked by Romulans and the entire Federation crew is soon dead. So the Doctor decides that it's up to him and this ships holo doctor (Andy Dick) to save the day by retaking the ship. The problem is that neither of them know how to fly a ship and the other holo doctor is a Dick.This was an awful lot of fun from start to finish--and I usually like the Doctor when he goes off on missions. The dialog between him and the other holo doctor was also priceless. All in all, a highly imaginative and interesting story from start to finish.By the way, if you'd like more information about why we don't see Mr. Dick on TV so often these days, try reading through his life story on Wikipedia. It makes for bizarre, disturbing and weird reading!",9

Just create many holo characters that are trained in extreme combat and put holo emitters throughout the ship! And once they get boarded by invading enemies, deploy our holo commandos!!!

However, the letters arrive in drips and drabs--which really makes no sense considering today we can transmit dozens or thousands of messages in small data packets. Why in the 24th century they should receive a few letters at a time is a bit funny considering how much technology has improved since this episode was made. Perhaps they were using old 2400 baud modems! As for the letters, some bring wonderful news from home, some bad news and some folks get no letters at all.Unfortunately for the crew, a warlike and very large race, the Hirogens, have discovered the ship because of these messages and now these folks are looking for a fight. At first they take Tuvok and Seven of Nine while they are in a shuttle. And when Voyager stops to examine some ancient device, the Hirogen are in hot pursuit. Fortunately, the Hirogens are a pretty stupid race as well!This is a very good episode complete with a new baddie which will be further plaguing Voyager. Well worth seeing.",8
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Hunters (TV Episode 1998)",Maihar'Du Speaks (Part II),"Tiny Ron was ""Maihar'Du"", The Grand Nagus' personal servant for almost all seven years of Deep Space Nine, it was only fitting he appear in Voyager at least once.We only got to see his helmeted head in the previous episode, as he tries to Interrupt Voyager's attempt to retrieve The Doc from the Alpha Quadrant and is shocked by Seven to get him to stop.But here, his race in named: The Hirogen. I think they used ""Tiny"" Ron because The Hirogen are supposed to be all Huge. You can see their stature emphasized in later Episodes. And Tiny's role in this is effective, because Tuvok and Seven are dwarfed by his mass, his hand can encompass Sevens head twice around.I have grown to love The Hirogen, especially as they showed up repeatedly in Voyager as either enemies or friends to Voyager. At first enemies, later collaborators and finally friends.What we learn in this episode is that they are a race of Hunters. Where the Klingons are Warriors, The Hirogen are Hunters, but they have many of the admirable traits of Klingons. I would almost say they are like ""The Predators"" but a little bit more accessible than any Predator we saw in any of the Predator or AVP films. Also, The Hirogen have Butts for Heads, but we don't get to see this yet. Here, they are in full Combat/Hunting Armor, which we learn later is protection against even a Neutron Star. But at this point in the Series, they are a Threat, and Tuvok gives Janeway a dire warning about them. But the same would have been said about The Klingons in The Original Series.Tiny's character - He is the ""Alpha"" Hirogen - He wants a Trophy so he chooses Seven's Intestines. But she is loathe to part with them. Besides, I don't think The Borg have found a way to replace them in a Drone, although The Borg Queen does not seem to need any intestines. When asked what purpose her intestines could possibly serve ""Tiny"" informs her that Interesting Intestine-Trophies will make him popular, honored by men and pursued by Women. We never really did get to see a Hirogen Woman, since they are somewhat reptilian, I suppose they lay eggs. So various of Seven's Borg or Human parts would be ""Objects D'Art"" when hung on this Hirogen's Bulkhead.I think many fans of the ""Riddick"" Chronicles will be surprised to see one of the Blades that Richard B Riddick uses in ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" - The one he uses to kill a whole troop of Necromongers on he surface of ""Crematoria"".And the Hirogen Ships are a little too tough for Voyager's weapons to handle. They use Monotanium Hull Plating, which is resistant to Phasers and Photon Torpedos.The Hirogen are the Guardians of the Galaxy Spanning Communications network that Voyager found in the previous episode- It is not clear if they actually made it, but they own it, and use it. So Tiny's ship is guarding this main Node, which is powered by a Forced Quantum Singularity, which we know is what Romulans use to power their Warp Drives and Cloaking Devices.The Quantum Black Hole in this array is being held stable by a Field, which Voyager is manipulating when fired upon by some other Hirogen ships. Needless to say, all of the Hirogen ships get sucked into the Singularity and Voyager almost follows them in, like a toilet which is being flushed.So Janeway in defending herself causes the destruction of the whole network, and makes new enemies of the Hirogen, at least for a time.Too bad ""Tiny's"" Ship got sucked in, it would have been good to have him as a recurring character. We never got to see how his Butt-Style Head looked under the helmet!There is a hint of some ominous ways The Hirogen collect their Trophies, they have huge machines that appear to liquefy all of their Prey's Internal Organs, Voyager had found Discarded Prey in a ship nearby. Seems like ""Skin"" is one thing The Hirogen do not prize as a Trophy. Unfortunately, this is never explored further in the rest of Voyager. It would have been interesting to see more of this process, albeit gruesome.",10
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Hunters (TV Episode 1998)",Hooray for USPS,"Two plot elements. The first is the fact that letters are arriving from earth because of the work of the Doctor in the previous episode. It was remindful of the mail-call on the MASH series. We get a glimpse of many of the crew as their letters arrive. Janeway has big news which I won't give away. The other plot is a group of hunter-aliens who control the portal that the information from the letters is coming from. Tuvok and Seven are sent to negotiate or to keep the channel open. These are big bad guys and may be formidable in the future. As the series is at about the half-way point, there are some new factors at work.",8
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Hunters (TV Episode 1998)",Letters from home,"This is very much an episode of two halves; after finding the array and getting a message to the Alpha Quadrant in the last episode they receive a message from home although it is somewhat garbled. As Seven works to decipher the message it becomes clear that it contains letters to the crew from friends and family back home. The crew's moral is raised although it turns out that not all of the messages contain good news; some speak of broken relationships and lost friends. As they couldn't get the complete message they head closer to the nearest relay station to see if they can get more of it. Seven and Tuvok head closer to the station in a shuttle but are captured by an alien race called the Hirogen who wish to kill them and remove various body parts as hunting trophies.This episode probably won't appeal to many who aren't fans of the series as most of the first half is taken up with people getting their letters or talking about the act that they are finally hearing from home, this is unlikely to appeal to people who don't know the characters. The second part where they confront the Hirogen is more exciting though.",7

However, evidently despite shooting the thing many times, it still managed to kill one of them and nearly kill the other. Voyager comes upon the Hirogen ship and tries to help, as they are cosmic do- gooders. However, this is a great example of the phrase 'no good deed goes unpunished' and soon the ship appears ready to be destroyed. And, in an interesting confrontation, Seven deliberately ignores the Captain's totally insane orders!I always thought that Captain Janeway was way too pacifist on the show and here she nearly destroys the ship because she's basically a social worker at heart. I say Seven was RIGHT! See what I mean when you see this one.Overall, a decent episode--and you'll soon see a lot more of these nasty Hirogen.

They take the wounded Hirogen aboard little knowing that its prey is still around, it isn't until something breaks in from outside the ship that they realise they have something more dangerous than one wounded Hirogen to worry about; his prey was Species 8472, the one species that even the Borg are scared of. When the Hirogen wakes up he demands to be released to continue his hunt but Janeway is having none of it, even when further Hirogen ships attack Voyager she refuses to let them hunt the Species 8472. It turns out their prey is wounded and just wants to return home and Janeway decides to help. This decision leads to a serious disagreement with Seven of Nine... perhaps Seven is becoming a little more free thinking than the captain intended.This was a decent episode which nicely illustrated the contradictions in having a chain of command while also expecting free thought, something Seven has difficulties with as she wasn't raised in such a system.",8

First it was the Borg and now it's the Hirogen and species 8472. What happened to the prime directive?In this episode, Seven was clearly right--both of these species are extremely dangerous and no doubt the winner of the ""hunt"" would then turn on the helpful crew who healed them. What gets me is Janeway is acting in a reckless manner. But it's amazing that the crew, particularly Tuvock, Belanna and Tom Paris who are logical and/or have been renegades previously put up with a captain who acts like this. Especially now that they've heard from home! But they act like drones. Only Seven is making sense.",4

Describing it as pure evil was unfair - in general, non-humanoid species are rare enough in Star Trek, and usually shown as xenophobic (probably to explain why they are not around much).Anyway, the episode was quite good, except of course for the captain's hypocrisy (or, better, the writers' disregard for continuity): she is unwilling to sacrifice the hunted alien even if it saves the whole of Voyager, but no one is there to remind her of that time she killed a guy called Tuvix.",8
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Prey (TV Episode 1998)",Foolish episode written with little regard to sensibility,In some ways the episode is up to standard because of the usual production standards. Unfortunately it becomes exceedingly silly with serious character errors. Not only does Captain Janeway seem to get a bout of psychosis - everyone seems to follow along. The only one with any kind of sense of Star Fleet common sense is 7 of 9.Before 7 of 9 actually saved the entire crew (and bizzarely got punished for this) the ship should have been completely destroyed or boarded losing all hands. The only reason for this miraculous ability to survive the assault seems to be there purely for the sake of justifying the Captain and crew's temporary insanity.I think that the episode can be explained away as a ridiculous dream by one of the crew members. I think that is the only way that the events that took place could be explained. Maybe it actually never happened... because if the entire crew really were under the influence of some kind of space hallucinogen (of which 7 of 9 was immune) they should have all met their end. Maybe the Hirogen and 8472 were off their faces on this space drug too!,5

1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Retrospect (TV Episode 1998)","Loved the story and build up, didn't like the ending","Interesting episode that I really wanted to like and while I did like the overall story and the build up, however bottom line I like satisfying endings and that's where things fell short. Good or bad I don't care, as long as it leaves you with somethingI love Seven's character and other than her good looks she brings a lot of intrigue to the show, so the thing that just rubs me the wrong way is her getting the short end of the stick lately. Previously tensions build in the Hunters & pray episodes where she goes head to head with Janeway, ends up saving the ship from certain destruction, but gets punished and disappoints the captain in the process. Finally we have Retrospect which is basically a rape episode, similar to the kidney thieves urban legend. There's no doubt in my mind that Kovin violated her and took the nano probes, none at all. Her fully regained memories looked genuine and pretty clear and don't show any evidence of it being a transposed memory from a previous experience.Now no evidence to support the crime and show irrefutable proof of the violation is basically the same as a woman accusing a man of raping her where the evidence cannot be conclusively determined, it's the same thing. In this case though we know Seven's character would never falsely accuse someone of this crime, and Kovin certainly comes off as an unlikable shady arms dealer with potentially a huge motive in harvesting her nano probes for weapons use.What nobody here mentions and what I don't get is why Tuvok never offered to mind meld with Seven. While his Meld probably would not be admissible as evidence, you would still think it would be a good way for him to at least corroborate her story, or if it indeed was a transposed and previous memory he would be able to help make her aware of that and further seek the truth. But they obviously want to leave this episode wishy washy and right in the middle. In the end did Kovin deserve to die if he was guilty? No, but he escapes, runs, and then almost destroys Voyager when cornered. Those are certainly not the acts of a falsely accused person, especially after they tell him the evidence is now in his favor. The episode leaves you thinking Seven got raped, and has the weight of his death on her shoulders. Pretty empty and weak...",5
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Retrospect (TV Episode 1998)",Handles Rape Culture Unevenly,"Two favourite characters (Seven and the Doctor) take center stage in this episode, with both taking strides towards greater responsibility and maturity. The scenario itself (Did Kovin violate Seven or not?) is also intriguing, a good thought-provoking premise for the show.Yet essentially the scenario boils down to did Kovin *rape* Seven, and I think the show leans too heavily towards blaming the victim. On the one hand, I take the point that accusations of rape are a heavy, dangerous thing to throw around willy-nilly. Kovin certainly suffers from the accusation of (possible) rape, regardless of whether the accusation is true or not. Unfortunately, it's not the lesson our culture needs to be learning right now. Witness (fifteen years after this episode aired) the Steubenville rape case, in which the rapists and not the victim earned the media's sympathy. Something similar happened here: As a previous reviewer said, it's never proved whether Seven's restored memories are true or false, yet it is Kovin and not Seven who ultimately receives the sympathy and compassion of the crew. Seven is left to feel guilty for her part in destroying Kovin. This seems like a classic example of blaming the victim: Seven may have been raped, but it is she who is to feel guilty, not Kovin. Despite the fact that the case is not concluded either way, I wish that Voyager had more consistently offered support to the victims of abuse and assault, instead of supporting the status quo. Even some balance, compassion for *both* parties, would have been more helpful than the one-sided interest in Kovin seen at here. As it is, this episode seems to contribute to rape culture.",5
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Retrospect (TV Episode 1998)",A travesty.,"This episode is a travesty. It holds up the rape culture that warns us to be cautious when a woman accuses someone of rape; maybe she's lying, maybe she's confused, maybe it was all a ""misunderstanding."" Above all, we must never, ever ruin a rapist's life over an accusation.In any other episode of STAR TREK wherein a regular crew member has an experience that is neither witnessed or experienced by anyone else, they are believed. Hands down. No questions. They are not required to prove anything, and the crew works on finding out exactly what is happening and how so they can fix it.Why is it that in an episode that is so obviously a parallel to what happens when a rape victim accuses their rapist, is suddenly the crew member's perceptions and veracity challenged? I've seen Bryan Fuller quoted as believing they somehow managed to take out all the sexual aspects of this episode, and he is profoundly mistaken. How can he be correct, when Seven literally says ""He violated me""? But no, she can't be telling the truth, she can't be perceiving the truth; it has to be something else, something more distant, something safer. In fact, we're left with the only other possible explanation being that Seven never suffered any trauma at all! No, it's just the memories of *other people's* trauma that are causing her to act EXACTLY LIKE A RAPE VICTIM.Not only is she wrong, but it costs a man's life--which is exactly the wrong message to send in an episode so very obviously tied to rape and sexual assault.I don't care what Bryan Fuller and Lisa Klink thought they were doing; this episode is far more about rape and sexual assault than it is about the dangers of misused psychology. Which, as someone with a degree in psychology, that is a WHOLE other can of worms for me.This episode should never have been approved, let alone shot and aired.",1

5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Retrospect (TV Episode 1998)",a moral dilemma with a twist,A reviewer complained that the writers should have shown that Seven of Nine's memories were false but I think this is besides the point. How could they do so within the constraints of a 42-43 minute episode? The more important issue is how does the Doctor deal with his misdiagnosis of Seven's false dreams as Kovin violating her body? The Doctor simply suggests to Janeway that she delete his psychological programming subroutine; Seven meanwhile begins to experience the painful human experience we know as remorse.The Captain tells the Doctor to grow up and learn from this experience since he's still helping the rest of the crew with their own psychological issues too. Its good to see a Voyager episode come about where the Doctor and Seven admit that they made a terrible mistake on Kovin and work to prevent a future misjudgment. The Captain does say that she had some concerns with Kovin's belligerent attitude towards her and the crew but she never accused him of anything.,8
6,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Retrospect (TV Episode 1998)",Poor writing,"This is one of my least favourite episodes of Voyager, almost as bad as The Thaw. The fundamental problem with the episode is that at no point does it make it clear to the viewer that Seven's memories are false. In the episode the case against Seven's story grows increasingly stronger but all of a sudden everyone changes their minds with no explanations at all for where Seven's memories came from or why she had them.As much as I may agree with the fundamental premise, that the testimony of abused people should not always be taken at face value, the episode would have done much more to serve this view if it had offered up an alternative explanation to Seven's memories, something they instead gloss over.",1
7,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Retrospect (TV Episode 1998)",I love everything about this episode,"This episode explores the unintended consequences of overactivism and over enthusiasm in any cause, even a seemingly just one, where a person's actions in defense of a phantom ""cause"" have real social consequences for bystanders. As much as we want to sympathize with 7 of 9 in the beginning, we are given clues early on that something is amiss. I picked this up with Tuvok's comments in the briefing room. The doctor early on identified with a victim mentality in the patient and let that cloud his judgment until the end. The result was disastrous, with the loss of life and the stain of remorse upon both the doctor and 7 of 9.In real life, the consequences may not be as dramatic. Someone could lose their reputation, their standing in the community, or their liberty, all over someone's vague memory recollection. This could be true of any case that comes before a court today.We know that human memory is flawed, even eye-witness testimony can prove to be inaccurate, and this episode reminds us that no matter how much we want justice, or retribution, for a victim, we had better make plain sure that person is actually a victim before we destroy other lives in pursuit of that cause.",8
8,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Retrospect (TV Episode 1998)",What happened to their weapon upgrades?,"I have read the other reviews and agree that it is unclear, for better or worse, what actually happened to Seven of Nine. The writers tried to trick the viewer at the end, in a way, by introducing doubt about the evidence collected. But it was only doubt and not a conclusion one way or the other.What I would have liked to know is: did they get that super weapon from the arms dealer? There have been many episodes where the Voyager crew seem to acquire advanced tech from their contacts along the way but rarely do they seem to keep any of it. It's frustrating, like when you see people running under fire who leave behind perfectly useful weapons and ammo dropped by the enemy.This was one of the details I appreciated about the Enterprise series; they upgraded as they went on their journey and used it.The exception to this up to now in Voyager is the integration of Borg technology provided by Seven of Nine.",6
9,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Retrospect (TV Episode 1998)",This episode's story is the reason I have a love/hate for the show,"To me, this episode's story shows two reasons why Voyager is sort of a very good show, then a very bad show. Firstly, we are treated with a very nice story. The Doctor found that Seven of Nine may have been sedated by supposedly friendly alien while showing off a new weapon. During Seven of Nine unconsciousness, she believed she saw the alien take technologies off her and placed into another body. Seven of Nine is unsure of this as the alien claimed that he accidentally overloaded a weapon he was showing Seven of Nine and after which he healed her when she regained consciousness. The alien denies that he stole any technology off her. Seven of Nine has only speculations and no hard physical evidences to her claims. The entire crew of Voyager comes to Seven of Nine's side and even contacted the alien's government who is not very happy. By the end of the show, it does a quick 180 on the story. The alien becomes frightened and angered by the accusations but at the same time Tuvok found evidences that the alien may in fact be innocent. At the end of the show, the alien accidentally kills himself and now everyone is very sorry. Even Seven of Nine who was sure of her memories weren't made up is now left to feel sorry for the alien just because he died before proving or disproving his guilt. Seven of Nine is told she is to feel guilty because she accused someone of something when she had no hard, concrete evidence to support her claim. She's basically told that she may have jumped the gun and accused someone before finding all the factual evidences even though the accused tried to run off before being allowed to clear his name.The part that gets me is how quickly this show's story can shift directions based on very little data. The part that I dislike isn't so much that Seven of Nine's may not have been violated by this alien, but the fact that the show suddenly shifted to one of sorrow and remorse without any foundation as to the new emotion. The emotion is made up in less than a minute towards the end of the show, yet everything prior to that point indicates other emotion.This flip-flop is most apparent in this episode, I believe, but it is present in nearly every episode of Voyager. Even the very first episode, we learn a single thing that somehow shifts the entire emotion of the crew from going one way to another and it is mostly based on just the perceived emotion rather than the actual emotion. Take for example, being violated and technology taken from you would make one feel anger, but then suddenly the guy blows himself up and now you're very, very sorry and sad. Why? What triggered this new emotion is less than a minute when you had all this circumstantial evidences that point to the contrary? Aside from the story flip-flop, the other problem with this episode that is present in a lot of other episodes is the fact that Voyager just acquired new technologies, but the course of events somehow render these technologies useless for what appears to be due to trivial reasons. Voyager just got a new cannon weapons system by this alien, but on the flip side, because of Seven of Nine's problems and the fact everyone felt remorse for the alien killing himself, it appears this technology was lost for reasons unknown just like the story.

11,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Retrospect (TV Episode 1998)",Thought provoking,"I found this episode rather good as it introduced a moral dilemma and showed character development.Seven's character was advanced as she discovered new emotions such as anger and regret. Surprisingly to me, she also showed evidence of compassion in response to Kovin's death, even despite her almost irrational anger towards him prior (thanks to the Doctor's encouragement!) She had stated earlier in the episode that she wanted him to pay and would be satisfied with nothing less, after being shown evidence supporting his innocence. Seven rarely changes her mind and so it was a surprise to see her do so at the end of the episode.Yes it was frustrating to be left with the question- Did Kovin do it or not? However some may feel that it is satisfying to be left with this dilemma to create an open-ended thought-provoking episode. I am on the border here. I do feel it would have been more satisfying to see that in the end, Seven's memories were accurate.I believe that while the end of the episode seems to point towards the characters agreeing it was a mistake, I do not. There must have been a reason for Seven's response to Kovin and the medical bay. She did not have this reaction during her countless visits prior. While the investigation did not find conclusive evidence, I believe that further investigation would have.However, in the event that Seven's memories actually originated from her Borg life, this also makes the episode a good lesson. To try to be objective and not judge someone based on simply not liking them. Many times when an innocent is attacked we love to place blame. And if someone is already irritating (like Kovin, as expressed by multiple crew during the episode) then we easily place the blame on that person with limited evidence without considering we could be wrong.It is episodes like these, which make you think deeper about morality and society, that make Star Trek good for the soul.",8

As he talks her through what happened it seems that Kovin might have taken some of her Borg nanoprobes against her will and injected them into somebody else. When the Captain is informed they return to see Kovin but he denies all the accusations. An examination of his lab doesn't reveal the device Seven recalls being restrained on but there are some of her nanoprobes which should be dormant but aren't.

However, out of the blue, Seven of Nine sees the man and attacks him--claiming he had assaulted her. No one witnessed anything like this but with the disjointed story she gave, the Doctor very quickly concludes she'd been violated. His belief in this was so intense that his objectivity did seem very questionable. So what really happened?Back in the 1990s, a major hot button in psychology was the notion of repressed memories. Many folks had recently undergone therapy and recovered memories involving sexual abuse and as a result several well-publicized prosecutions occurred. However, many psychotherapists believed that these memories were either implanted by bad therapists or were simply a witch hunt--while others felt that these memories were ALWAYS true and should not be ignored. I was very aware of this debate, as I was a therapist during this time and had investigated the phenomenon as part of a graduate school project. This time period and debate is the context for ""Retrospect"". Back in the 90s, the debate was very much ongoing, though today most in the field would hold such memories having little value.So is this any good? Well, I did love that the film discussed the phenomenon but too many times the writing was poor. An important debate was occasionally one-dimensional in its discussion.

People react in the way in which people do in real life.I would say the whole point of the episode is examining the notion of questioning emotion over logic. People with ""witch-hunt"" types of mentality ( always guilty regardless of whether they can be proved innocent) won't like it. The reason for this is because the episode reflects real life.Unlike the last episode people stay in character this time. 7 of 9 (contrary to some people) IS taken seriously and people do seem to jump to conclusions probably because she is one of their own.In no way does the episode suggest that a woman's rights are less than male's... none whatsoever. It is purely reflecting on the need to use sound judgement and seek the truth in an objective manner. There are plenty of times when perpetrators of some form of violation are truely guilty; some of those people get away with it and some don't. There are also several incidents where innocent people get wrongly convicted or have their life destroyed because of false allegations. It is just life.",7

A device has been attached to each of them preventing them from realising what is going on; they really believe they are the characters they are playing in the simulation. The main simulation they are forced to live though is set during the Second World War in occupied France and the crew are taking part as members of the resistance and US soldiers.

Harry Kim thinks of a way he might be able to free the crew and to this end he enlists the help of the Doctor who manages to deactivate the device controlling Seven and send her back in to the simulation so she can access the controls needed to free the remaining crew members.This was a good episode even if the WWII setting was a little cliché... at least the problems weren't due to the holodeck safeties malfunctioning yet again.

Janeway is their Leader, Tuvok is her second in command, and of course, Seven of Sixty-Nine is their Nightclub-Singer-Slash- Demolition Expert. What a voice, she was great.This was the first time in Voyager where we are shown that The Holodeck can affect Physical Parameter Changes on the people using it - This is explored later when Seven creates Quarters for herself and has dates with a Holo-Chakotay. And also an excuse to film Roxann Dawson while being Very Prego.The Hirogen have taken over Voyager and have made it into a gargantuan Holodeck, spreading emitters over many decks and making one huge room. They have enlisted a bedraggled Harry Kim to maintain this for them, but the emitters suck too much power from Voyager's Main Systems, it's destroying the ship. The Hirogen, while advanced, are mainly interested only in hunting cunning PREY, although they can do the work themselves, they'd rather Shoot, Stab, and Hunt Voyager Crew Members and shunt them back to Sickbay where the Doctor has an assembly-line triage set up to fix 'em as they come rolling in with horrific wounds.The Alpha Hirogen in this, when it comes down to what is important is acting to preserve his race, to make a better future for the Hirogen. But his Beta is more like the Nazi Character played by the great J. Paul Boehmer. In fact the Alpha tries to communicate ideas about Honor to Boehmer's Character, but he's a Holodeck Construct and acts only as he is programmed.The Hirogen have also made a way to make Voyager's Crew actually believe they are really acting out this fantasy war, but the Doctor has a way to make them remember who they are. His first target is Seven of Sixty- Nine, he jiggles her Borg Implants to make her remember who she is, blocking the Hirogen Signal.

In actuality, Roxann Dawson was pregnant during the filming of this episode, so she didn't have to disguise her pregnancy.

I don't know if that's meant as praise or an insult. I can only assume insult because the setting when this show begin REALLY sucks!! I love sci-fi--not seeing the Voyager crew as French men and women during the German occupation in 1944! Talk about contrived and stupid!! So, no matter WHY and what happens next, when the show began, I absolutely cringed. So what's all this really about anyway? It seems that the Hirogen have taken over the ship and have oddly decided to place everyone in 1944 Occupied France. Why? I dunno...I guess Paramount just wanted to use their back lot as well as some German uniforms! Fortunately, not ALL the show is set in this period and it turns out that the crew are being sent into many different scenarios so that the Hirogen can assess the crew's abilities as prey. I really wish they'd NOT used the Nazis and just had a more arena-like setting where crew battled it out with a wide variety of species--that might have made a lot more sense. It's a shame, as the Hirogen were good ideas for villains but they are wasted here in this often ultra- silly two-parter.By the way, I was a huge fan of the series ""Enterprise"", though it was a failure compared to other Trek shows.

This is probably my favorite part of Part II, but as Janeway finds out later, it was a mistake.

First, they ran out of ideas for the show. This isn't surprising since all the Trek series put together consisted of 28 seasons of shows!!! Second, the studio had a back lot and a lot of German uniforms and so they decided to use them...even though the reason why you see them in the show seems dumb to some (and you can count me among them).When two-part episode begins, the Hirogens have already taken over the ship. They've imprisoned many of the crew in holodecks and experience the hunt in various settings throughout history or on different planets. You see one briefly of a Klingon hunt but most of this nonsense is set in Occupied France during WWII--Nazis and all.

After his initial reaction of suspicion to Kellin, he falls for her again and does all he can to help her remain aboard Voyager. But when a retrieval agent from her people, a tracer, sneaks aboard to take her back, the tracer levels a weapon at Kellin. Chakotay backs off, and seems to hide behind the woman, allowing her to take the shot without trying to do anything about it. Seeing that scene again, it just seemed so odd to see Chakotay back away, instead of jumping in between them to try to wrestle the gun away, or at least take the shot to protect his woman. He does not even try to protect her. Anyway, that really made the story fall apart for me. I still gave this a 7 out of 10, because of the lovely Virginia Madsen and her fine performance as the alien Kellin.",7

After she has a brief fight with another ship very close to Voyager, Kellin contacts Voyager and asks for help from Chakotay specifically. Oddly, however, Chakotay doesn't recognize her. Soon you learn why--she's from a species that doesn't want outside contact and they go to very extreme lengths to keep it that way. If anyone leaves the planet, they are tracked down and anyone having contact forgets and their computers are wiped! Kellin insists that she'd spend a lot of time on Voyager and then proves this DID occur. So why, then, does she return? Well, it seems that Mr. Super-Sexy, Chakotay, has stolen her heart and she's here to seek asylum.The notion of a world that goes to such extremes to keep its existence private is pretty unique. My only complaint is that having a cop whose job it is to bring in runaways then falling in love and wanting to defect is a bit hard to believe. Additionally, she KILLED her own kind in escaping and no one seemed to remember this or care. Odd...but still a good episode.",8

I think it's great to be able to see another, darker side of the cast without going into the other universe. Here it's another version of history with many flaws that's the premise for this quite successful experimental glimpse.The story unfolds like this: a much darker form of voyager and it's crew are shown. Their barbarians and murderers. Come to find it's 700 yrs. In the future and this is the history being taught to the 2 races inhabiting a D.Q. Planet. This version is challenged by a newly reactivated doctor, who is silenced when he attempts to tell his side of the story to Quarren the curator of the ""voyeger museum"". But after thinking it over, Quarren re-activates the doctor and agrees to hear him out. More things happen. I won't tell you the ending, save that it's quite a moving scene.Record this download it.

After the display concludes a member of the public of the species who appeared to seek Voyager's help confronts to curator about the accuracy of the display. The curator says that he has found an artefact that should prove his theories shortly. When he examines the item it turns out to be a copy of the Doctor who, when activated, is shocked at the misrepresentation of Voyager's actions and sets about putting things right, although it isn't certain that he will be believed.This is a superior episode of Voyager, it is obviously the Doctor's episode and Robert Picardo performs well in the role. It was also great to see the rest of the crew acting out of character in the simulation; it was so over the top that it became darkly comic.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Living Witness (TV Episode 1998)",I love this episode!,"When feeling nostalgic and going through old TNG or Voyager episodes this one ranks in my top 5.I love how they portray the voyager crew as a ruthless merciless band of thugs tromping their way through the galaxy, pretty much throwing the morality book out the air lock with their black leather gloves on. It's bold and epic, and yet in a comically tasteful or tasteless way such that it's intriguing, gripping and down right funny.The first 15 minutes of the episode is hysterical, I loved seeing Voyager armed with all that arsenal, the crew bent on destruction, and it's backup Borg security protocol lol! Talk about a well oil'd machine in the interest of self preservation and domination!Perhaps what I find most intriguing about the episode is it tactfully strides on the concept of different nations perspectives on events of history and how it puts them in the best of light. I'm from America and this is an American show, and while I detest war I can't help but wonder how other nations view shared events in history. How our history books might differ from theirs, and I suspect they do... I'm not political, yet I have often felt we as the ""Good o'l US of A"" take on a somewhat bullish or dominance precedence in world affairs, getting involved in foreign soil affairs and wars which don't or at least shouldn't concern us. Okay I'm sure I stepped in it now... but in part that's what this episode makes me think aboutOverall great episode, nice to see them change things up, jump off the deep end and just go for it.

They blames voyager for disrupting their peace talks. And have an entire museum with holographic scenes of voyager's interaction with the two aliens shown from the perspective of the aliens. Their narrarive is erroneous and hysterical. Then someone from the museum accidentally discovers and activates the EMH backup file which was part of their artifacts. The backup doctor has a different (true) recollection of the squabble, but will anyone take his his account seriously?This episode is about how cultures can come or fail to come to grips with the reality of their past. And how those misconceptions and lies can have a lasting crippling effect on the societies. It also demonstrates how difficult it can be to present the truth when you are addressing people who are investing in a more convienient narrative for their own peace of mind, regarding of the evidence.It's a great story topic for science fiction which isn't very often told in an interesting way like the way we see it in this episode. This episode manages to be one of the more insightful and funny episodes of the series. This one and blink of an eye are my all time favorite Voyager episodes. Its certainly worth a viewing, and I'd argue multiple viewings. It's also the only Star Trek episode to not feature any main characters in their ordinary form. And it takes place further into the future than any other episode. And it isn't even a time travel episode. All in all, a very noteworthy episode.",10
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Living Witness (TV Episode 1998)",Excellent Episode...,"...unfortunately I can't help feeling a little sad for this copy of the doctor because he never got to see his family return home. Oh well, by this time the Doc should be able to get a mobile emitter without using time travel! On the serious side this is a fascinating episode based upon the dangers of revisionist history. The descendants of one side of a major conflict involving the Voyager crew and another species have managed to fabricate a version of the events that place themselves in the most favorable position. Using historical records and artifacts, this side of the conflict has managed to create a version of history that seems like it could be factual, but was radically off-base. Needless to say, but this consequences of this revisionist history has rippled through their history. These events take place 700 years in the future and are challenged when a copy of the holographic doctor is discovered and is rightfully outraged by all this.Replace ""Voyager"" with ""United States"" and the alien society's historical re-enactments with the movie ""Fahrenheit 911"" and this episode makes for some interesting commentary on the consequences of propaganda and revisionist history. That's what makes Star Trek great: the stories provide excellent and often timeless commentary on society.",10
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Living Witness (TV Episode 1998)",Yippee--a sadistic version of Voyager!,"Many years ago, the original ""Star Trek"" show had a classic, ""Mirror, Mirror"". In this show, the away team accidentally beamed to an alternate reality where the Enterprise crew was evil. It was wonderful--with deliciously evil performances by the cast. However, follow-up episodes in this same alternate universe were far less successful--mostly because they overused the idea. Fortunately, a similar sort of evil ship is seen in ""Living Witness""--but with so much originality that it all works very well.When the show begins, you see Captain Janeway acting very much unlike she usually does. Soon you realize that this ISN'T actually Voyager but a holographic representation that the Kyrians are watching 700 years in the future. The past they construct is a lie- -and they THINK that Voyager was an evil ship which ruthlessly used people in their trek across the galaxy. They are blamed for all the planet's woes and now folks go to a museum to learn about the evil Voyager! However, one of the museum workers decides to activate the backup of the holo Doctor--and he learns that their view of Voyager is really a mess!I loved just how evil Voyager was in this show. I loved when Chakotay was torturing a prisoner and Mr. Kim intervened--not to stop him but to assist in beating the man. Then, the Doctor has a much better idea--injecting a solution that slowly and painfully dissolves the guy's brain!! They are so over the top awful that I had a good laugh. It's also funny to see that Janeway has her own army of Borg that she uses ruthlessly--assimilating the people they capture!Bold, edgy, creative and thankfully not so nice and touchy-feely like too many of the show's other episodes.",10

But the fly in the ointment for the curator is a holographic device that brings our doctor to ""life."" He begins to tear apart the extrapolations created for the populace. Of course, there is a price to pay. There are still warlike factions on the planet and the power people don't want to give up their stranglehold.

The #1 best part of the episode takes place in the transporter room with captain Janeway ""showing her true colors"" as a friend of mine put it; thankfully she relents.The second best episode is that (what will become) a trend in Harry Kim's behavior starts here. Not just speaking out his opinion, but having confidence in his opinions and standing up for himself.

Returning to the ship it becomes apparent that they need the planets atmosphere to survive. Whatever the strange liquid was it appears to have changed them in some fundamental way or perhaps it has done something even more surprising.This episode was good in the way it showed how Harry's character has developed, he is no longer fresh out of the Academy and when he has an idea he is willing to push that idea to the senior crew. Once it becomes apparent what is really happening it was surprising to see the captain come close to breaking the prime directive even if nobody points this out at the time. I could have done without the subplot about Neelix trying to find a bed in sickbay during fuel crisis but that is a fairly minor quibble in a good episode.",8

When they get there they set about checking the ship is fully operational after its flight and familiarising themselves with the new technology. While doing this a strange piece of alien technology is found; it turns out the ship is not what it seems, rather than being a Star Fleet ship it is an alien ship and that alien wants revenge on the crew of Voyager for helping the Borg defeat species 8472, an action that let the Borg go on and assimilate his people.

On the down side they did seem rather too quick to trust Arturis, it seemed a bit more than a coincidence that Star Fleet would send a ship to a location that would be nearby just as they met somebody who could translate the message, also the crew of Voyager managed to get the new technology to work on they ship rather quickly, still these are small matters that didn't spoil my enjoyment of the episode.

1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Hope and Fear (TV Episode 1998)",An excellent episode,"For me, this episode epitomised what Voyager could have been.What made DS9, or even TNG in a limited way, intriguing was how what they did was permanent: they weren't warping off at the end of the day, leaving whatever problem behind. Voyager was king of this. Arturis is a tragic character, and there could have been some excellent episodes built off the premise of people trying to exact revenge on Voyager because of their actions, or even helping Voyager. The Hirogen almost did this, but it was only to ask FOR help. Not really the same.And the initial concept is a very cool idea. The USS Dauntless was a great idea, but I'm glad it was an illusion. It was too quick a solution, but if it was real it could have changed or ended Voyager. Really their journey through the Delta Quadrant wasn't as decisive or as interesting as the producers and writers hoped.So, fittingly, this episode brings Hope for the series, but also Fear.",9

Irrecoverable, until now.Enter Ray Wise who was a Proto-Vulcan in the Next Generation Episode ""Who Watches the Watchmen"" as ""Arturis"", from an interesting Race of people who have large brains, he can learn any language from hearing only a few phrases spoken in it. He is also good with Mathematics, and he is able to create an Algorithm that ""decodes"" the scrambled message. In it are Spacial Coordinates. Voyager finds there a Prototype Ship equipped with ""Quantum Slipstream Drive"" and it had been flown to the Delta Quadrant on Autopilot.A Gift Horse which is a little too convenient. When the complete Message from Admiral ""Windbag"" Hayes (Jack Shearer) is played, it explains this is a Prototype that can get Voyager's Crew safely home in 3 Months.I believe it. That is, I believe that the NX-01A Dauntless can do it. But Janeway has a wind up about something, a Ship and a Way Home delivered to Voyager's Doorstep?Even in real life, there is always some Gift-Horse twist.This new development also brings up issues. What about the Doctor's Main Program in Sickbay? And Seven, does she really want to go to Earth?But the Dauntless is an impeccable piece of Engineering. It's a magnificent Ship. No Replicators or Holodecks, but it has Crew Quarters, enough to hold the entire crew.But even while considering using this new miracle, Janeway is not willing to dump Voyager like an Old Sock. She has Engineering copy the Quantum Slipstream Tech and install it into Voyager, so they can take it along too. The Dauntless can tolerate the stresses of a prolonged Slipstream Flight, but Voyagers Structural Integrity Fields are inefficient for the task.But Seven is not ready to go to Earth yet, as she Argues with Janeway about Janeway's obsession about returning to Earth, Janeway is looking at the one Data Block that Arturis said was too corrupt to fix, and finds a way to fix it.And the information in that Block tells a different story than the one told on The Dauntless. At the same time, Harry finds a Power Glitch in the Dauntless Engine Room, which when scanned reveals an Alien Power Console- ""Not All is As it Seems"".When confronted with these new inconsistencies, Arturis tries to shift suspicion to Seven. But it does not work, even ""evidence"" that Seven is tampering is placed too conveniently and too easy to find.So as they try to grab Arturis, he overpowers them to break open a console to grab a huge lever, and the Alien Structure of the Dauntless Bridge becomes apparent.Voyager is able to beam most of the crew off, leaving Janeway and Seven at Arturis' lack of Mercy.Arturis' Race had a vested interest in the defeat of The Borg. But when it did not happen, the Borg invaded his Homeworld. Arturis describes the plight of his Race as hundreds of Borg Cubes invaded their space, sweeping aside all resistance and leaving his people to their worst fears.Ray Wise was probably the best Actor in the whole world to embody this, he has played many similar characters, all with lost hope. In a way, he is like Walter Bishop of Fringe, a gifted individual who has lost his mind.Had there been more time, Janeway could have talked him down from his plan and gotten him to Join Voyager's Crew. But Arturis was a man plagued by the wrong choices. As a Survivor of a Borg Attack, he had a beautiful Ship to go wherever he wanted, but he opted to use this gift to pursue Voyager and ""Make Them Pay"" for what Janeway had done.In this way, he takes Janeway totally by surprise, she is not expecting his torrent of hate and revenge. She deals with it the best she can.Fortunately, the Slipstream Tech was easy for Voyager to install and use, they catch up with The ""Dauntless"" and take her shields down in short order, beaming Janeway and Seven off in the nick of time.Alas for poor Arturis, we'll not see him anymore, for what he thought was H2O was H2SO4. But I suppose Borg Drones are immune to Hydrochloric Acid.If only he had turned his talents toward something better, at least for himself. We never learn even the name of his race, what kind of man he was, what he did, what his interests were.To get that information, we would have to ask The Borg Collective.",10

So now it's up to the crew to survive while help MIGHT be on the way.As for their help, the crew really looks screwed as it consists of some Talaxians (a rather weak and annoying race), Paris in a shuttle, the Doctor (who is, after all, a hologram) and Suder. Suder is a serial killer who has reformed--but now he'll have to channel his old wicked ways to try to regain control of the ship. Although the eventual triumph of the crew of Voyager (it's a foregone conclusion) is VERY hard to believe, this is an excellent and exciting episode. Well worth seeing even if part one makes far less sense.",9
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Basics: Part II (TV Episode 1996)",Satisfying......I Guess!,"The conclusion of this episode is fun for those of us who are pulling for the good guys. Any Kazon television viewers might feel differently. These are kind of fun villains because they are quite enterprising and quite stupid at the same time. Ceska has to continually remind her ""man"" what the right things to do are, and he reluctantly follows her advice. There is a lot of action on the surface of the planet where the original crew is trying to survive. Meanwhile, the Doc uses his holographic gifts and along with Suder and later, Paris, plots a method of disrupting the ship's technology. It is fun to watch the subtle changes in the ship as it collapses around the Kazon. I wonder if we've seen the last of them.",9
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Flashback (TV Episode 1996)",Beautifully Made Homage to Star Trek VI,"Of COURSE this was a Brannon Braga script. Sometimes he got it, sometimes he missed. Mostly here in this episode, he got it, and I applaud this. But I say Mostly - Because he did blow it with wrong details.So this episode was produced at the same time the great Homage to Trouble with Tribbles was being made for Deep Space Nine. As a Voyager episode, it is above average, as a 30th Anniversary(?) Trek Celebration, it is acceptable. A few story elements were slightly out of alignment, but overall, the whole episode was very well done.So Tuvok is being buffeted by a recurring past memory - A Memory he never had. But what does this memory have to do with his memories of being on The Excelsior 80 years earlier, during the time of the Khitomer Conference and Kirk's incarceration by the Klingons? Well for that you would have to watch it.What I will state here regards the recreation of the Excelsior Bridge. This is not the same huge Bridge Module that James B Sikking sat at the command chair of in ""Star Trek III: The search for a better actress to play Saavik"" - This is a Bridge with Captain Sulu in the chair. The Production Crew magnificently recreated the Hexagonal Pedestal which held Sulu's Coffee Cup - But now, we get to see that it was actually Vulcan Tea poured by Tuvok.George Takei and Grace Lee Whitney reprise their roles as Sulu and Rand, who is now doing what Uhura used to do. We also have some of the rest of the same actors who were on that Bridge in Star Trek VI - Including Jeremy Roberts as ""Lt. Valtane"" and the Helm Officer, Helmsman Lojur (Boris Lee Krutonog) - We even have a visit from our old friend Micheal Ansara as KANG- Sitting comfortably on the Bridge of a Klingon D-7 Battle Cruiser recreated in all of it's glory. Except now, as in Deep Space Nine, he has his Brow Ridges like Worf- Who ever DID explain why some had ridges and some didn't in ""Trials and Tribbleations"".So that Excelsior Bridge, merged with a few outtakes of the explosion of Praxis, gave us a believable recollection. Except that Valtane was standing on the Bridge with the rest of Sulu's Crew at the end of Star Trek VI, and not dead as he was in this episode. So I'll just assume Braga was writing Voyager as another Alternate Universe story like he liked to write about, one in which Valtane got Killed by an exploding conduit.Other than that, well - We have to find a ""Delta Quadrant"" conundrum in which to explain why Tuvok must needs Mind Meld with Janeway - And as we had never seen a memory recollected by a Vulcan IN Mind-Meld-Mode, perhaps this is what it looked like. The Delta Quadrant Conundrum was pretty weak, but the Excelsior Backstory was not. But I won't remove any stars for Braga's Botching up of Canon Events. Overall, this was a better offering than some of other Voyager plots, which mostly involved some kind of ""Plasmatic Energy"" - Of which I wonder, is this Energy caused by Listening to ""Butcher Baby"" by The Plasmatics? I must have laughed myself silly the first time I heard this term used in Voyager.",10
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Flashback (TV Episode 1996)",A wasted opportunity,"While DS9 was spending its 30th Anniversary money ""Forrest Gumping"" its cast into a meticulous and affectionate tribute to The Original Series, ""Voyager"" went the Special Guest Star route and recruited George Takei, Grace Lee Whitney, Michael Ansara and as much of the supporting cast of ""The Undiscovered Country"" as we would remember. In theory, it was a fun idea (certainly TNG had luck with the TOS casting stunt a few times), but the execution was sloppy, dramatically inert and certainly underwhelming even as an average ""Voyager"" episode, to say nothing for an anniversary celebration.The basic plot is uninteresting - Tuvok (already a raised flag, his was not one of the strongest characters) has memories of bad green screen effects of a girl falling off a cliff that are driving him nuts. Rooting out the memory in his mind, he and Janeway re-remember his first mission aboard the Excelsior during the events of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country."" Thus, the events between scenes when we saw the Excelsior in the film are brought to light. Sulu and Rand have a couple character moments but there's nothing compelling about the mission Sulu goes on - to say it is unimaginative and full of recent modern Trek clichés like incremental percentage-weakened shields, combustible gas, anomalies, defying logic and regulations is putting it aptly. Hardly befits the clever and rather fresh take on Trek of Nicholas Meyer's film when put to comparison. Tuvok's affliction is given copious amounts of technobabble worrying by the Doctor which raises the dramatic stakes by less than zero, and everything is resolved in a way that (typically, for the talented but not detail oriented Brannon Braga) actually totally contradicts the very movie it is meant to attentively flesh out.The main problem just comes down to the fact that George Takei was brought back to Star Trek merely to spend half of his time reenacting scenes from ""Star Trek VI"" or playing the same dry scenes over and over again while Tim Russ and Kate Mulgrew whisper about the day's boring events in the foreground or background. What I would have given to see an original adventure for Captain Sulu that made better use of these actors (even the wooden Grace Lee Whitney deserved a little better than she got, but she at least she was allowed to be on more than one set). Sulu and Janeway don't even have a satisfying meeting - Janeway goes out of her way to ignore him when the opportunity arises. The ""emotional"" climax of the film is full of bad FX and bad drama.Season 3 of ""Voyager"" is actually rather fun, but to this day I still consider ""Flashback"" one of ""Voyager's"" most damning missteps. For all the fun it was to bring back those characters, it was squandered with a lazy script that did little to advance any of the characters, laughably undermined continuity it had to pay attention to and celebrated the 30th Anniversary in a way that didn't inspire much confidence in where the franchise was going.",4
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Flashback (TV Episode 1996)",Back To The Future,"Tuvok was a Vulcan, but now he a CRAZY brother!!! It happens to the best of us, eventually.Tuvok gets recurring flashbacks of a little girl falling to her death, and eventually asks Janeway to join him in a mindmeld which features George Takei as Captain Sulu. Here comes the crazy science, though: Janeway is ""spotted"" by the figments of Tuvok's flashback imagination, and she has to disguise herself to ""fool"" these mere memories. Huh?We're playing fast and loose with the concept of the mindmeld here. In fact we're making it up as we go along. It's never really clear how Janeway's life is threatened by Tuvok's meld but we're treated to an anticlimactic medi-babble festival as the Doctor narrates the brain waves of each of them, somehow magically able to interpret alpha waves as thought and experience. What spectacular bullspit! And it turns out the flashback was caused by an alien parasite, which the Doc gets to yak about for another ten minutes, killing ALL the drama in the episode. The stupidity of the science and muddled meld outweigh the fun of going back into ""Star Trek VI."" A shame.GRADE: C-",7

Tuvok starts to feel unwell than has what is either a flashback or an hallucination featuring him failing to save a young girl. When it happens again The Doctor believes it must be a repressed memory, something which can cause brain damage to Vulcans. The only treatment is to mind meld with somebody very close. He chooses to meld with Captain Janeway but when he does they find themselves seeing a different memory; he is back on the USS Excelsior under Captain Sulu as they are preparing to attempt to rescue Kirk and McCoy from the Klingons. As they head to Qo'noS they pass through a nebula that looks very similar to that seen at the start of the episode and it too contains Cerrillium. Something goes wrong with the meld and some how Sulu sees Captain Janeway, something rather odd given that he is only a memory.It was interesting how the events in this episode took place at the same time as 'Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country', this leads to some amusing comparisons between Star Fleet in those times with those of Voyager's time. It was good to see George Takei making a guest appearance as Sulu. When we learn the cause of Tuvok's memory it was a little disappointing and seemed as if it was just a device to allow the more interesting story from Tuvok's past to feature, another weakness was the image of the falling girl which looked obviously fake. Despite these flaws it was still an entertaining episode though.",8
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Flashback (TV Episode 1996)","Only okay...but it was nice to see some old ""Star Trek"" characters.","This is a special episode of the series, as it's a celebration of the 30th anniversary of the franchise. At the same time, ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" created its homage, the fan-freakin-tastic ""Trials and Tribble-ations""--one of the very best Trek shows of all time. The ""Star Trek: Voyager"" homage is good but not even close to how amazing the DS9 version was.When the show begins, Tuvak begins having weird flashbacks of an incident he says never occurred. On top of that, he begins to behave goofy and becomes ill. The Doctor thinks some repressed memory* is responsible and Captain Janeway climbs inside Tuvok's head to see his memories and help him recover this hidden memory.The journey soon takes the pair to the old Excelsior--a ship commanded by Captain Sulu (yes, Sulu!) and it shows much of what led up to Sulu's surprise entrance into the film ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country"". On hand along with George Takei is Grace Lee Whitney** as Commander Rand (formerly Yeoman Rand in ""Star Trek"") as well as Michael Ansara as 'Kang' (a Klingon from ""Star Trek"").Overall, while I enjoyed seeing a few old cast members, the plot itself was only okay at best. It came off as a bit contrived and lacked all the charm and humor that made ""Trials and Tribble-ations"" such a wonderful episode. *In the 1990s, so-called repressed memories were all the rage and folks assumed they happened often. However, in the last 25 years or so, so many of these 'repressed incidents' have been shown to have never actually occurred. It's a LONG and complicated and divisive topic-- and one I had to deal with when I was working as a psychotherapist.**Ms. Whitney was an interesting choice for this reunion episode, as she had actually reportedly been thrown off the original Trek series due to her substance abuse. However, from what she said in her autobiography, she got her life together and is a happier and better person. I love to hear about people overcoming difficulties, so it was really nice to see her here.",6
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Flashback (TV Episode 1996)",Star Trek: Voyager - Flashback,"When Tuvok suffers a ""panic attack"" due to ""engrams"" functioning as a recurring memory involving him as a little boy unable to hold onto the hand of a girl begging him not to let go, falling to her death. This precipice Tuvok recalls, and the girl he cannot save, is a memory that is fictional, something that never happened to him. With each attack, which causes Tuvok to seize/freeze and collapse, eyes wide open and lost, the chances of brain death increase. To determine what is causing this and how to stop it from killing her officer, Janeway opts to voluntarily connect with him via Vulcan mind meld, seeing/experiencing a particular rescue mission on board the Excelsior, when Captain Sulu ordered his ship to go after Kirk and Bones, who had been imprisoned on a Klingon prison world (imagine Siberia and that is quite a close approximation of where Kirk and Bones found themselves) for murder of the Klingon Chancellor (David Warner) they weren't responsible for.Linking Voyager to ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country"", Tuvok confronting/objecting to Sulu's disobedience of Starfleet and receiving a grand response for just why he was justified to do so, and Janeway granted the chance to experience time on the Excelsior is like a great, big, loving hug that produces those warm and fuzzies Trek fans appreciate. Or at least this Trek fan certainly appreciates the nods and returns to the past and how the current show/characters respond to what happened then (in this case, Janeway sees how Tuvok performed on the Excelsior, and intimate moments where he was younger and less dedicated to Starfleet, joining at his parents' wishes). In the sixth Star Trek film, very little was ever elaborated and the opportunity to make an episode such as ""Flashback"" set aboard the Excelsior (well, in the memories of Tuvok, that is) is welcome by this viewer. When you never want an episode to end, that is a special kind of experience.What a wonderful moment for Takei—who sits in that Captain's chair well—as he cleverly takes advantage of a nebula to shake off a Klingon cruiser insisting on being an entourage through their territory to Federation space by using sirillium available which ignites. Any chance to throw a bone to those of us who love our Original Star Trek cast of characters I fully endorse, especially if the secondary officers get a little love such as Sulu. A pleasant surprise is seeing Rand on board the Excelsior as well, with the recreation of the opening to The Undiscovered Country a nostalgic treat. The invasion of a type of virus using the memory as a means to lie dormant and buried from discovery is more or less just an excuse to put Janeway and Tuvok on the Excelsior, while Picardi's Doctor and Kes monitor their vitals while in the Vulcan mind meld. Janeway on the Excelsior Bridge, soaking it all in, is a neat visual. She surmises that just getting one opportunity to be on board with the likes of Kirk, Spock, and Sulu would have been extraordinary; Tuvok, who experienced it himself but didn't have the awe and reverence, essentially shares that with her. When there is a ""malfunction"" during the meld due to another panic attack, and Sulu actually sees Janeway, it really offers a peculiar twist in the mix! Fans of Sulu and Rand should, I think, get a kick out of ""Flashback"". It serves as a fan episode certain to bring about feelings of exhilaration and surprise. Grace Lee Whitney makes the most of her time in the episode, with all the charm and mouth still there. Nifty factoid included: Vulcans suffer brain damage if repressed memories aren't absolved.With Jeremy Roberts (as Lt. Dimitri on the Excelsior who bunked with Tuvok and celebrated his post on the Excelsior and their rescue mission to fetch Kirk and Bones) from Star Trek VI and Michael Ansara (as Kang, Klingon commander insisting Sulu adhere to his demands of ""helping them"" get back to where they belong) from Star Trek's Original Series.

He begins to suffer from something stuck in his brain and a recurring waking nightmare of his inability to save a girl from falling off a precipice.

There are no guards and the prisoners will kill each other for the meagre rations they are given.

Voyager leaves at speed and sets about looking for the real source of the explosives. Back on the planet things aren't going well; their attempts to deactivate the force field protecting the chute have failed and Tom has been seriously wounded in a knife fight. Harry's second attempt succeeds but when he gets to the top of the chute he makes a startling discovery that will make escape much harder.This was a good episode, it may have lacked spectacular special effects laden action but the prison was suitably claustrophobic and the mind-effecting clamps they were forced to wear added to that feeling. While one knows that they will ultimately get out their method was never clear, especially when we learn the nature of their prison.

Star Trek is great at taking everyday life themes And secretly transporting them into the show, disguising them as Something else but in actuality they represent a much deeper aspect of Our own society that can sometimes be hard to look at otherwise.

She then hauls off to the planet preparing to turn a fourteen year old girl and her big brother over to a regime that obviously doesn't deal with criminals in a fair and just manner without even any of the moral angsting she's so fond of. Then, when the planet leader is inexplicably uncooperative (you'd think he'd be more interested in the actual terrorists), she demands the big brother tell her how to get into the prison since he just happens to have the access codes (and a small cargo ship that resembled Neelix's - so why he never carried out his own rescue mission is unknown). Then, when he demanded to be allow to rescue his own people, she threatened to send them to the planet out of hand. Rather than pointing out the obvious fact that she would thereby sacrifice both her bargaining chips and the only people remotely willing to help, he capitulated and gave up his only bargaining chip.Then Janeway jumps blindly down a chute into an unknown hostile environment. I know there's no Riker demanding she stay safe on the ship, but COME ON. Tuvok doesn't have a SWAT team he can call into action in situations like this so the next best thing is to send the CAPTAIN?? THEN they fly off into the sunset without a backward glance at the political prisoners of a corrupt regime being beaten, starved, tortured, and murdered.REALLY?!?

This is a cheap episode; cheaply written and cheaply produced. The so-called ""Chute"" that dumps new prisoners inside, is a poorly disguised air conditioning duct that moves as people try to crawl through it. Most disappointing however, is that this episode adds absolutely nothing to the understanding of any characters in the show, other civilizations, or anything about Voyager's saga through the Delta Quadrant.

B'Elanna comes up with the idea of using a holodeck simulation of Jupiter Station where he was created to diagnose the problem. This program contains a holographic representation of Dr. Zimmerman who examines the Doctor's program but can't think of a solution. Ultimately Kes has an idea although they can only try it once as once it has run the Dr. Zimmerman program will be lost.This was an interesting episode which looked at the nature of The Doctor, it was interesting that they worked hard to save his memories showing how much the crew's opinions about his nature have changed; in early episodes they wouldn't have believed he had feelings let alone worried about them. Robert Picardo put in a fine performance as the two Doctors and Jennifer Lien was good as Kes, her character always comes across as the most caring of the crew.

So imagine my pleasure in seeing TWO...well, sort of, in one episode!When the show begins, some aliens appear on Paris and Torres' shuttle--shooting them and then disappearing. However, when they get back to Voyager and Paris needs medical treatment, the Doctor begins to act as if he's forgetting how to treat patients. And, through the course of the show it gets MUCH worse (my favorite is when he repeatedly tries to treat a dead patient). So, to try to figure out what's wrong, the crew activate a program that will help them troubleshoot the system...and it turns out to be another embodiment of Dr. Zimmerman--the same guy who created the holo Doc and used his own personality liberally in creating the helper program...though it's even grouchier! I was very happy watching both of them and also felt it was quite touching watching Kes interacting with them as well.The other plot involves the aliens who shot the two crew members at the beginning. They are apparently part of a nasty race that attacks intruders in their space with a swarm-like attack--with tiny ships attaching themselves to the invaders and boring their way inside. How can they possibly defeat such an enemy--especially when they come upon the bodies of other species that wandered into the system?!Overall, this is a pretty exciting and very enjoyable episode.

Neelix admits that he knows very little about this species but does tell Janeway that those who enter their space never returnor if their ships do return; those onboard aren't alive to talk about it. But this is dedicated almost exclusively to Picardi, and he doesn't disappoint. But this is also a great episode for Jennifer Lien's Kes, doing all she can to rescue her friend from total degradation. I think anyone who has watched their loved ones deteriorate totally understands how Kes feels when Doctor doesn't recognize who she is, and then later pieces of memory return to give her momentary hope. I just felt this whole plot was exceptionally well written and acted. The addition of the program of Doctor's creator, Livingston (also Picardi, resembling Doctor's personality at the very beginning), Kes' spark of idea to help figure out possible resolutions for her friend's dilemma, is a real blast. Kes, without the help of Torres (Janeway needs her in Engineering as the swarm have sent off a beam that is stifling the warp engines) or even Paris (Janeway needs him at the con on the Bridge), has to strategize on her own to come up with a plan, looking to Livingston's holographic program for answers. The swarm is quite a visual dynamo, with all these thousands of ships, with the appearance of small bugs, especially when they begin to attach to the hull of the Voyager. Janeway, recognizing the swarm's ""mentality"" and using their own technology / attack against them, proves she's a wily, cunning Captain, relying on her talented officers to assist in outwitting those that threaten her ship. They scatter and flee when the Voyager gives them a dose of their own medicine. But the episode's tailored to Picardi's strengths, enabling him to play two distinct characters yet give them similarities because one is the program of Doctor's inventor (so there would be personality and physical likenesses) while the other is his achievement. Kes appealing for the Doctor to retain two years of experience (he would have been fixed through a type of ""reboot"" but lost everything he's seen and felt over that span of time on the Voyager) if at all possible, and Janeway agreeing he deserved that, tells us he has meant such a great deallike Robot in Lost in Space, Doctor is no longer just some program but a friend that has others who care about him.",8

And that's a shame because I liked the character a lot. What was once limited and fascinating is now limitless and tedious. Did the writers realize that they were putting characters into comas or giving them diseases every week just to justify the Doctor's massive screen time and endless story lines? I did, and it's starting to pi$$ me off.Here, the ship is under attack by a Plot Device- aliens without a name- as an excuse to tell the story of Doctor's degrading program. And we do that, of course, by featuring Robert Picardo in a dual role! Seems even the ship's computer feels Doc is stretched too thin as he begins losing his memory. Luckily the holodeck diagnostic program features the original doctor who designed the program so Picardo is able to linger on the final syllables of double the weekly wordssssss.We're told the only way to save him is to reset his memory, and upon reboot he certainly can't remember Kes, yet seconds later he's singing the aria from the opening sequence, leaving us to believe that the writers couldn't make up their minds, and didn't!

Chakotay and Paris beam down to the surface and discover that it has indeed been visited by people from the Alpha Quadrant; a couple of Feringi are there and have usurped the local religion for their own gain. They live in luxury, waited on by beautiful under-dressed women while the population are not doing so well. Jayeway believes that they should be removed as they are only there because they attended a Federation led conference seven years before at the other end of the wormhole. They however point out that their arrival does correspond to the locals' religious prophecies. Since they can't remove them by force Neelix pays them a visit suitably disguised as The Grand Proxy, claiming that the Negus has recalled them to Ferenginar; the plan appears to be working until the Ferengi decide they would rather kill him than leave. Learning more of the people's prophecies they make them believe it is time for the 'Sages' to leave, unfortunately they interpret the prophecy as meaning they must burn the Sages, including Neelix.As is usually the case with Ferengi episodes this one was fairly amusing, although one can see the Captain's point of view about their corruption of the locals it does seem as though they are taking it too seriously when they risk not getting home to remove the Ferengi. It was fun to see Ethan Phillips, playing Neelix the Ferengi. The ending while predictable was satisfactory; after all if they could have used the wormhole the series would have ended rather prematurely.",8
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" False Profits (TV Episode 1996)",how not to get a stranded crew home.,"Yes, they have to keep the show going, but this episode shows one of the great flaws in ""Voyager"" as a concept. Janeway should be doing everything she can to get her crew home; after all, she was the one who got them stranded in the Delta Quadrant in the first place. So, with the wormhole almost upon them, and the way home there for the taking, Janeway instead plays games with an alien planet and two miserable Ferengi, and almost literally misses the bus. Even so, once she transports the Ferengi to the ship, shouldn't they be tied up like cattle and guarded by several well-armed crewmen, who would realize that keeping the Ferengi on ice is their ticket back to Earth? Janeway's sympathy for the inhabitants of the planet must take a back-seat to her primary mission. This episode, like so many Trek shows, in all the series, could be sub-titled ""liberals in space."" Great morality back on Earth, no so hot when exiled 75,000 light-years from home.",6

This would have been a much better episode if not for the wormhole... the idea that Janeway wastes a chance to get home is deplorable and pathetic.Voyager discovers a planet on which two Ferengi are posing as Gods in order to exploit and steal from their subjects. Of course Voyager intervenes- Janeway instantly beams the two greedy culprits up to the ship. Then she lets them go again. Why? What possible reason could the decisive Janeway have for getting involved and then instantly withdrawing? The little speech they gave? Bullspit. It's just a bad plot device because the moment she beams them back down she starts devising another method of ending their charade.This buys us time until the brilliant idea of surgically altering Neelix to look like a Ferengi and beaming him down to pose as the Grand Proxy and trick the con-men into ending their reign of terror. Wasn't it easier when you had them in your transporter room? Neelix bungles, of course, but the highlight of this episode is the Ferengi crooks who are genuinely funny and entertaining.Of course, when the suddenly-inept Voyager crew finally manages to beam the Ferengi back on board, they promptly overpower security and escape into space, ending Voyager's chance to take the wormhole back home, which was the ENTIRE PREMISE OF THIS SHOW IN THE FIRST PLACE!

3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" False Profits (TV Episode 1996)",One of the memorable failures in Voyager,"For me this was one of the most important episodes in the entire series. In my opinion, this was the biggest blunder they had to endure.Voyager finds an old unstable TNG wormhole, complete with 2 lost ferengi. The crew knows this is their best shot to get home, and they actually make the wormhole stable. That's it, that's all they needed. It could have clearly ended there if their officers were competent.Instead we got an over-righteous Janeway picking her priorities out of a hat at random, and blind Tuvak who should have clearly noted that logically the ferengi would try to sabotage their extraction from paradise at any cost. What happened next wasn't a shocker, but simply the dumbest intervention in history. If you have not seen this episode yet, the amount of episodes after this will clearly give away the ending.So what were the alternatives? 1. Ignore the ferengi, travel home and then report the ferengi crimes, so somebody else returns through the now stable wormhole to arrest them. 2. Extract the ferengi by a simple confrontation or transporter, lock them up in a cell or something, with guards posted around, preventing all possible ferengi mishaps. 3. Expose and arrest the ferengi and let the local population deal with them. Personally, 1 was my favorite.But what about the rest of the series, you ask? Well, who says we have to end it? Why not build an outpost in the Delta quadrant next to the wormhole, restock the Voyager crew and send it on the longest mission in history of star fleet to answer if Voyager could actually get home without the wormhole. Is that hard to grasp? For the writers it was apparently so. Sad, new characters, new stories, new possibilities, all lost.",3
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" False Profits (TV Episode 1996)",Kind of fun but the end was pretty stupid...as well as disappointing.,"One of the best things about ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"", in my opinion, was that although many of the episodes were deadly serious, every so often they'd toss in a comedic episode starring the Ferengi to keep things light and fun. Unfortunately, through much of ""Star Trek: Voyager"" light and fun are NOT words you'd use to describe the show and too often the series needed something like this. Well, someone must have realized this when they came up with ""False Profits""--an episode that inexplicably brings the Ferengi into the Delta Quadrant.When the show begins, Voyager comes upon an M-class planet that demands their attention. This is because although it's social evolution places it squarely in the Bronze Age, there are replicators on there as well!! Obviously some advanced race has imposed itself on the planet. However, when Paris and Chakotay go to investigate, they're horrified to find two Ferengi jerks are there--and they've created a religion around themselves and are completely taking advantage of these naive people. Voyager needs to not only get these jerks away from these people but figure out how they got there so that Voyager can use the same method to get themselves home.This episode made me laugh though it clearly is not among the best Ferengi shows. Additionally, the ending really was a letdown. Although some wormhole was available to get them back to the Alpha Quadrant, a contrived reason they could NOT use it was tossed in and it really made little sense. It was just an excuse not to end the series and it seemed like it.",7
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" False Profits (TV Episode 1996)",First self termination,"Star Trek franchise has lots of incongruent moments and episodes, with plot holes and character inconsistencies. I suppose it's inevitable staffing so many writers and being tasked to create 45 minutes of compelling storylines 26 times per season. The Voyager series had plenty of raising the eyebrow moments through the first 2+ seasons -- ""Oh Seska! You died...well..Voyager..it was nice having you, now abandon ship fierce Kazon warriors, to the escape pods!!"" or ""That's nice we've discovered transwarp speed and can go anywhere in the universe in the blink of an eye, but let's just get home the old fashioned way and forego further experimentation"" and ""let's just forget Michael Jonas the 2nd crewman traitor ever existed."" -- but I find False Profit to be the first real face palm episode in the series, specifically regarding the last 5 minutes.There's about 50 things to nit pick, starting with the two Ferengi apparently besting Star Fleet security on their way to the brig. Sure, the Ferengi are cunning, but I fail to think of any plausible scenario that would allow them to get free, especially considering the circumstances where the security should be on heightened alert given everything that leads up to it. But the real letdown is literally sitting there while the wormhole home shrinks away.It didn't have to lead to the Alpha Quadrant or the site of the TNG episode from 7 years prior. It's an unstable wormhole...maybe it only gets them 10,000 light years closer or maybe it takes them to the Beta or Gamma quadrant? At this point, they're 2+ years into the show and have moved about that far. They're still running into Kazon - a culture only 30 years new to space -- and the Viidians - a culture seemingly more dedicated to curing their phage than space dominance....so apparently they haven't moved very far. It was probably about time to move them..onward a bit. Blown opportunity. But why? Why would they get distracted from their primary mission objection in order to dink around with the Ferengi? At first, it was because they were upsetting the natural order of things because the natives saw the Ferengi as their gods. That objection apparently last 5 minutes, because in the next scene they're using Neelix in a ruse that objectively is no different than simply beaming the Ferengi off the planet and into a brig. Eventually, they get everything they want and are ready to go home. The Ferengi then manage to unintentionally collapse the wormhole, so Voyager has to move fast. However, Voyager can't adjust or react quick enough to seize their chance. By the way, Voyager moving like molasses jumping to warp or full impulse is kind of recurring thing. The Enterprise moves like a Cheetah in comparison. Maybe the main computer processes the jump slower or can't establish the warp field as quickly, I don't know, I can't remember if they ever address it throughout the series. Apparently, having the best pilot in the quadrant doesn't help in this regard. Anyway, how easily the Voyager crew loses sight on going home in this episode, is a little too much to overlook. Where's Tuvok to point this out? Conspicuously, largely absent. This is probably the first self termination point in the series. The audience is forced the red pill and awakens from the matrix and it's time to reset.",

But to have an incredibly viable method of escape messed up by the need to put these guys in their places is quite absurd. Knowing the wormhole is out there, it should occupy all their attention. The Ferengi weren't killing people. Granted, they are quite unpleasant, but ultimately a drop of water in the huge galactic ocean. Using all the capabilities they have including Neelix's disguise distracts them from their true goal. These two would have come and gone eventually. It is fun to see them get their comeuppance, but at what expense. Janeway really does make some monumentally poor decisions.",6

Everything is sweet and nice and life looks quite fine for everyone. In the midst of this, Torres begins having very sexy dreams--very realistic and sexy dreams. Perhaps these dreams are the result of the crew's interactions with this new race--one that has heightened psychic powers. However, when this movie-like series of dreams turn ugly and violent and talk of mass murder, Torres realizes that someone is trying to covertly pass on to the Federation that this 'nice' race has a past that is anything but nice!This is a clever episode and manages to both entertain and say something of significance.

As for Harry's love interest; unusually she didn't turn out to be a danger to him as is usually the case, which made a nice surprise, in fact she was the Enarans who was willing to see the same memories B'Elanna had seen.This was a decent if not great episode; Roxann Dawson is good as B'Elanna and the story was intriguing even though it wasn't action packed. While the message was a little heavy handed there is nothing wrong with being critical of such behaviour.

0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Sacred Ground (TV Episode 1996)",Snore...too preachy and simple-minded for my tastes,"Despite my love for Star Trek (yes, even Voyager), to attempt addressing 'faith vs. science' in the Star Trek universe has always struck me as a futile venture. Given that virtually every conceivable paranormal/supernatural idea ever conceived -- psychic powers, souls, spirits, ghosts, even gods -- have already become a documented 'factual' part of this fictional reality, how can any ST character reasonably harbor doubt about the potential validity of any new spiritual faith? Why would anyone, as Janeway does in this episode, adopt a strongly skeptical world view, à la a 20th century scientist, in a universe where aliens with god powers abound (Metrons, Talosians, worm-hole aliens/Bayjor Prophets, the Caretakers/Nacenes to name but a few)? Conversely, in a universe where every manifestation of a god or religion ends up with some sort of empirical explanation to justify the belief, why would any character ever need to ""have faith"" in the first place (i.e. who needs to ""have faith"" when you have evidence)? Overall, this real-world dilemma re: faith and science doesn't seem to translate very well into the world of Star Trek.Secondly, there is also some misguided commentary woven into this story that attempts to equivocate science with blind-faith, science with closed-mindedness, and the 'inexplicable' as being somehow a barrier to scientific investigation that only faith can transcend. Such tired canards may have traction among a few anti-scientific or scientifically-illiterate audience members who happen to also like Star Trek. However, given the staunchly pro-science history of this television franchise and its audience, I would think the writers would have anticipated most of the audience calling them out for relying on such sophistry. At such moments in this story, things simply degrade into a tedious and preachy diatribe.I understand a writer's desire to develop a story that perhaps has relevancy in the real world (where faith and science do often conflict), but, in my opinion, the paramount goal in fiction is good story-telling above all else. I don't mind stories that also have relevancy and/or philosophical messages embedded in them, but when such things are included at the expense of the story the whole venture so often simply becomes sanctimonious trash. This episode is better than that, but it does dip it's big toe into that trash pile on more than one occasion. I tend to skip over it when it comes up on re-runs for that reason.",3

Star Trek is specifically about a future in which reason and science have triumphed over superstition and fear. It is completely out of character.By the end of the episode, the sheer immortality of a religious sect prepared to let someone die because they were ignorant of a dangerous part of a shrine is barely remembered as Janeway is apparently upset by the scientific explanation of how she saved Kess.

4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Sacred Ground (TV Episode 1996)",An episode sacrificed to America's obsession with religion.,"A perfectly boring episode exclusively built to feed the American obsession with faith and religion. Apparenty, even bible belt types watch space faring characters riding futuristic technologies that would have never existed had ""faith"" managed to impose its way back in the Renaissance.How many of these devotional types realise that without science, most of them would not even exist? Without science, few of us would survive our first weeks, and amongst those who would, only a minority would reach the ripe age of thirty-five. The simple concept of infant mortality was never a notion religious natures concerned themselves with before science became dominant in our cultures. Envisioning science as a system of beliefs is a dangerous and fallacious perception, only fitting the reductionist perspective of religious agendas, who see life as a cartoonish struggle between good and evil. Science is not a belief. It's a collection of empirical theories in constant trial, destined to be replaced when new ones prove to be more effective within their field and within the system. Scientists who participate in the stupid debate of science vs. religion probably have a devotional tendency themselves. They will be easily outclassed in such debates, for the simple reason that religious people cannot be reached by logic or reason, since their beliefs are solely based on irrational structures.The very existence of episodes like this one, in an otherwise relatively intelligent series, is a worrisome warning. It predicts a future where America will increasingly fail to compete with no-nonsensical countries such as China, India, or pretty much any other culture on its way up, and not as religiously fanatical as the US.The results are already out there for all to see anyway, with the steady decline of American scientific achievements and the rise of tomorrow's superpowers (which might even include good old Russia).",2
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Sacred Ground (TV Episode 1996)",An awful stinker!,"Let me get this straight. According to this episode, science is dogmatic, arrogant and wrong. And the solution to all problems is to disregard critical thinking for the sake of blind and erroneous faith! No wonder our world is in such a mess today! As much as I disagree with this view, I wouldn't mind if it came from the weekly Sunday service at church. I would ignore it and continue with my life. But when this view comes from Star Trek, I take offense.Being non-religious doesn't mean non-spiritual. Spirituality as a concept is so much more than religious dogma, doctrines and rituals. And it doesn't need to be dumped down to superstitions and belief to the supernatural. I always enjoyed when traces of spirituality surfaced in Star Trek's stories. They elevated the stories giving them sometimes a profound impact. But this turkey of an episode, just blows it! It's a complete reversal of the Star Trek philosophy. Nonsensical, illogical and utterly silly! I particularly take offense with two major themes in this episode: A)That it portrays science as dogmatic, arrogant and wrong. Funny how the exact opposite is indeed the case, and it is religion itself that has showcased these characteristics time and again throughout its history! Actually, its the hallmark of religion to be dogmatic, arrogant and rigid. Well, when you can't hold up to scrutiny, accuse the others of your faults! B)In the conclusion of the episode, it is revealed that there was indeed a perfectly sound scientific explanation for Kes's accident and its treatment, one that the religious people didn't bother to mention at all, leaving Kes to face death because she unintentionally and unknowingly and with no malice triggered the 'biogenic forcefield'. Actually this theme is indicative of religion and religious teachings in general. An 'infidel' facing divine punishment and death because of his unbelief and lack of faith towards a particular doctrine/religion. A punishment brought forward by 'all-loving' God/gods/spirits, who are perfectly happy to provide love and treatment once the 'infidel' succumbs to the required belief. But not before! Well, so much for 'freedom-of-will' that God supposedly gave to man! Even Kate Mulgrew's acting couldn't save this episode for me. And her character's blatant inability to acknowledge the simple truth and succumb to blind, erroneous faith just made me wanna shot the screen! By far, one of the worst Star Trek episodes.

In this episode, Kes is put into a coma by some force field and Janeway goes through a series of spiritual challenges to get Kes out of it.These challenges mirror those that real-life cults do to control their members. Through this sort of brainwashing (involving e.g. hallucinogens, sensory deprivation, and extreme physical exertion), Janeway starts believing all this spiritual hokum, though there are rational explanations for everything that occurs. That's the power and danger of cults.This largely reminds me of ""The X-Files"" episode ""Beyond the Sea"", in which the usually skeptical Scully, much like Janeway in this episode, starts accepting spiritual explanations out of desperation, but eventually realizes that everything that occurred had rational explanations.",
8,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Sacred Ground (TV Episode 1996)",One of the best science fiction episodes I have seen,"It saddens me that many of the previous reviewers of this episode of Star Trek: Voyager have taken such a dim look at this episode and written it off.First thing I must absolutely mention is that many of history's greatest scientists were also great men of faith. Men such as Nicholas Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, who might be looked favorably upon by fans of a science fiction series set in space, as well as Blaise Pascal, Robert Boyle, Michael Faraday, Gregor Mendel, William Kelvin, George Gabriel Stokes, James Clerk Maxwell, Max Planck, and even Albert Einstein who famously said ""I want to know how God created this world, I am not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know His thoughts, the rest are details"" and ""Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind."" Scientists who ignore there is a strong correlation between their faith and some of the greatest discoveries in history do a huge disservice to themselves and ignore their own history.Second, it seems counter-intuitive to me for anyone to say that science holds all the answers, when there is so much more to the human experience. I am not talking about religion here specifically, but also philosophy and a fascination with the unknown, and a desire on our part to figure things out. How boring and uninteresting would life be if all there was in the universe, in our experience, was only what we saw or could observe in some fashion? Could such a life be called ""life""? I hardly think so.Kes, while exploring an area of religious significance for the Nechani people, is rendered unconscious and dying. Captain Janeway, ever the rational scientist who is skeptical of religious belief, finds precedent in the literature of the Nechani that would allow her to undergo a ritual in order to save Kes' life. But what happens when the rational mind meets something it can't wrap its head around?I commend the writers of this episode of Voyager to go to the places where science fails. And for the reviewer who said that science fiction shouldn't deal with fantasy, what a load of crock. The whole Star Trek franchise is fantasy, unless you actually happen to live in the 24th century.",10

I generally agree with the complaints that come before mine. This story relied on cartoonish stereotypes -- sanctimonious superiority from the magic-believers and bewilderment that borders on stupidity from the science thinkers -- and a simpleton's view of a very old (and usually interesting) societal debate that has been part of every human society since the dawn of time.",1
10,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Sacred Ground (TV Episode 1996)",Bastardizes science and insults spirituality and science equally,"tl;dr: Themes of spirituality vs science are a ridiculous premise which utilizes nothing but obvious logical fallacies and inconsistent characters and plot devices to preach how faith > science in such a heavy handed way that it offends both, as well as the entire point of Star TrekI have read previous reviews and I only have a few points of thought to add.Many people who think this episode is anything better than scientifically-illiterate garbage, use the argument ""Atheists are mad because star trek finally wrote something they didn't agree with"" This is objectively false and an apparent misunderstanding of both the opinions of the critics of this episode and the themes of star trek.The basic concept of this episode is to take Janeway through a spirit journey so that she can take a leap of faith, against her scientific understanding. Here are the reasons why this is the worst episode of star trek:1. It uses strawman arguments so obvious that it offends the viewer's intelligence to suggest that trust in science and critical thinking is somehow arrogant and requiring of faith. It is true that we must know the limits to our own scientific understanding and to assume we know everything is inherently flawed in its arrogance. However, that is NOT the scientific method (quite the opposite) and this idea of science is never encouraged or utilized throughout the entirety of star trek. Science is not a dogmatic belief structure that refuses all possibilities that are not readily obvious. Science is the study of the universe and everything. Saying that science is useless is like saying knowledge and consciousness is useless. It's a meaningless attack on the pursuit of knowledge. This alone shatters the entire theme of the episode, because of how wrong its basic premise is.2. It pits spirituality against science as if they are somehow mutually exclusive. This episode tries to show how being open minded means embracing flawed logic, disguised as spiritual enlightenment. Spirituality can be a form of personal acceptance of one's limit of knowledge and acceptance that knowledge beyond our current understanding could bring new possibilities of enlightening and beautiful cognitive states. It does not need to include the willful ignorance of critical thinking and facts fueling an active refusal of progress, curiosity, and yearning to understand. The asinine ramblings of the monks in this episode not only misunderstand science completely, but offends all concepts of spirituality in doing so.Star Trek has introduced god like beings in the past, that are completely beyond our scientific understanding, in a way more responsible and scientific fashion (which furthers Star Trek themes of respect of spirituality but acceptance of science and critical thinking as supreme). In fact, it is very common for science fiction to explore the magnanimous nature of multidimensional beings and god entities in a scientific fashion. 3. Characters are inconsistent. I buy Janeway's willingness to enter the archway; I do not buy her embracing of the terrible psychotic babbling of the idiotic characters that inhabit the planet. If Bashir were in this situation, we would have had a way more enjoyable episode (or if we had competent writers).4. Finally and arguably the most important point, this episode and flawed theme goes against literally everything Star Trek stands for. Star Trek is not about pro atheism (however it does share a lot of fundamental ideas with that of the atheist and agnostic). Star Trek is about progressive ideals and acceptance of culture, spirituality, and intelligence through focus on critical thinking and science as it explores the depths of the unknown and unexplored. This episode is so heavy handed, ignorant, and close minded that it alienates anyone who might have gleamed something interesting from the concepts otherwise It spits in the face of the ideals of star trek and placates scientifically-illiterate people, as opposed to educating open minded respect and intelligence. People hate this, not because it's anti-atheistic (although that is irritating in itself) but because it fails so miserably at everything that is so fundamental about star trek in the first place. If you are one of those who love this episode, then I fail to understand why you are watching Star Trek at all.",1
11,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Sacred Ground (TV Episode 1996)","Apart from some wonderful guest appearances, this is one crappy episode....","Of all the Star Trek shows, ""Voyager"" is by far my least favorite. Much of it is because there is too much pseudo-religious mumbo-jumbo. I liked the religious elements of ""Deep Space 9""--mostly because the Bajoran religion was created FOR the show. However, in ""Voyager"", the writers APPROPRIATED some Native American religious traditions...SOME. In the 1990s, Hollywood painted a silly notion of these people--with Pocahontas talking to willow trees and Chakotay talking about his spirit guides and taking advice on what to do from dead relatives! As a result, native religions have been boiled down to clichés...silly ones at that. Plus, instead of religion being woven into the series intelligently, every so often they just tossed it in like a plot device--and it shows.Here in a stinker of an episode, Kes is hit by an energy beam and to cure her, Captain Janeway must undergo a spirit journey with a bunch of inscrutable (naturally) and mischievous (of course) spirits who talk and talk and talk. It's enough to make the viewer want to become a strident atheist because it's all so stupid, preachy and dull. This is sadder still because the show features three spirits--and they are played by very familiar character actors (Estelle Harris who was a regular on ""Seinfelf"", Keene Curtis who was a regular on ""Cheers"" and Parley Baer who was a regular on ""The Andy Griffith Show--and the three played on many, many other shows over the years). I loved seeing these three--particularly Baer, as this is his final role. But to have them in THIS bilge?! Yecch!I'd rate this among the worst episodes in any of the Trek the series...and that's saying a lot, as about 10% of the ""Voyager"" shows would fall into this category!",1
12,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Sacred Ground (TV Episode 1996)",Star Trek Fail,"Sold episode except that it is a science vs faith plot which runs counter to the whole universe. The cornerstone of Star Trek, in it's resurgence, was science and humanity but this episode takes a few previous hints at spirituality in this series to an extreme. There's a scientific explanation for the problem but no-one other the Doctor and Kes seem to want to accept that. Kind of sad that the franchise would allow a Star Fleet Captain of a cutting-edge vessel would sink to this level even if you accept the incredibly banal and simplistic plot: Give up on logic and knowledge and you will find a cure... as a base allegory this works OK in the sense that sometimes we have to have faith in something to succeed but it pins that faith on religion instead of humanity. That's the simple reason this episode fails the Universe: it alludes that faith in the unknowable is somehow superior to faith in ourselves.",4
13,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Sacred Ground (TV Episode 1996)","It is not science vs fantasy or rationalism vs religion, it is simple faith","For the casual observer looking for an episode to watch, you may either view the ratings of any particular episodes or even be so inclined to read the comments. Many of the comments rated this as one of the worst Voyager episodes, I strongly disagree. Many also claimed this episode was an affront to rationalism and scientific thought, no it was not. Though a debate could occur over the degree of sanctimony the alien species had, I believe this particular Voyager episode was more in spirit with Star Trek than most other Voyager episodes. I say this as Voyager often follow into a particular plot: first contact new species, a problem emerges with interaction (usually a major character is injured or detained), and through ethnocentric point of view, Voyager's crew solves the problem without trying to understand the other side's point of view. Voyager was far quicker to briefly highlight a disagreement in philosophy, to only ignore the bigger questions the particular incident raised towards or in comparison to the human condition. And since we need a convenient plot ending to the episode, a quick fix, save, or rescue is written it without really addressing the bigger issue. This episode was more in line with Picard and TNG, a willingness to go through a ritual even if it is to save a crewmen. Janeway did not enter the caves to become spiritually enlightened and when she finally became open to the experience and observed the ritual as would the alien species, was she enlightened. It did not necessarily change her character, but it made her briefly question her absolute devotion to science and devotion. Based on all the other comments, it almost seems that Star Trek is an atheist harbor, where a leap of faith cannot and should not occur. Although we should strive to be able to rationalize the beauty of the world, to understand the underlying mysteries of the universe, we should also be capable of appreciating not knowing and simply accepting either 1) one day we will know, or 2) have hope and faith in what we do. I did not see this as an attack on science, but simply the omission we do not yet understand everything and even if we did, sometimes we just have to believe something good will happen. I also do not believe the alien species had an ill will towards Kes, it was an accident, and they felt this transcendental experience is a worthwhile cause to share with the universe, especially those willing to sit and learn about strange new worlds and new civilizations. If I had a pet peeve with Voyager is that it only tried to solve problems through its own narrow understanding of the universe and saw itself as the gift to the world. Janeway and crew often thought they knew everything better and it took most of an episode to begrudgingly accept another point of view from another species. With all the negative comments for this particular, it is no wonder we have a polarized country that seeks to not back down in the endless fight that is religion versus science. Watch the episode, make up your own mind, but above all be the open-mindedness that true Trek truly envisioned. This was not a religion vs science episode and could have been a TNG episode.",7
14,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Sacred Ground (TV Episode 1996)",Neither Science nor Religion - Something Else,"Most reviewers are putting this into a science vs. religion context. I know this is a popular battleground. That doesn't make it right or even pertinent.The basic plot is this. Voyager is visiting a planet populated by largely friendly people. Clearly, some inhabitants are deeply spiritual and others are influenced by science. They've struck a balance though. The factual and spiritual have agreed not to interfere with each other's views. Spiritual matters are left to those inclined to faith and scientific matters to those who trust observation.Clearly there is a parallel here between the ""Voyager Universe"" and attitudes about science and religion in the United States.While on shore leave Kes and Neelix visit a shrine. Kes steps into the entrance of the shrine and is hit with a high-energy ""biogenic"" field that puts her into a coma. She is beamed back on board Voyager and The Doctor attempts to find the cause and a cure. He can see that her neural pathways are damaged, but he cannot determine how to reverse the process. Worse, Kes will likely die unless a means to reverse the damage is found.Neelix is frantic to do something to save Kes' life. In his research he happens upon a very ancient story about a similar situation. A king's son is exposed to the field and the King petitions the spirits to save his son. As with most apocryphal stories, what the King actually did is not in the story; only that the spirits took favor on the king and restored the son to life.Based on this information, Janeway petitions the monks of the shrine to go through the ""purification ritual."" Off camera, she does research on religious rituals, from her statements we are left to conjecture that most of what she's researched are ancient Earth rituals practiced involving deprivation, hardship, and physical tests of strength; much like Native American rituals practiced before the Europeans stepped foot on these shores.The order gladly accepts Janeway's petition and she is met by a friendly, non-assuming woman, who at first appearance is minor maintenance personal. We soon learn that she is Janeway's ""guide."" Armed with her assumptions, Janeway submits herself to tests of endurance, most of which she herself assumes are required. Janeway is first asked to change her clothes and is then ushered into a room with three older people who are apparently waiting...for what she does not know. Because these three people seem not to know what is going on, and are engaged in what seems to be gossip, Janeway gives them little credence. Any questions she asks the three are answered vaguely or with other questions.Her guide patiently helps her, but also admonishes Janeway that that the tests are meaningless. After many trying ordeals, including being bitten by an unseen creature, Janeway returns to the ship only to find that the data The Doctor has gathered from Janeway's ordeal is useless. What little he has been able to gather is no help in effecting a cure. Janeway returns to the shrine and her guide reminds her that the tests of endurance were meaningless. She tells Janeway that she, the captain, devised the tests herself. Once again, Janeway changes into ceremonial robes and is ushered into the ""waiting room"" inhabited by the same three old people. This time Janeway's questions are no longer based on her presumptions. She actually sits down with the intention of talking to the three to find out what they know. They are open questions and it becomes obvious that the three people she discarded as lost and ineffectual, are actually the spirits themselves. The spirits seem to represent kindness, reason, and action. ""Action"" advises the captain to kill Kes by taking her through the field again. He tells her ""she's dead anyway. Kill her."" Janeway leaves the room determined to take the advice of the spirits.Janeway asks that Kes be beamed down, and with Neelix and The Doctor in attendance, picks Kes up and together they step through the field. Whatever energy has damaged Kes is now reversed and Kes makes a speedy recovery.Back on board Voyager the doctor comes up with a rationale for the cure, but Janeway is only half listening. She's no convert, but she is no longer so sure science has all the answers.This, in my opinion, is what makes this episode interesting. It's not about religion, not really. It's more about not allowing preconceived notions to so influence our thinking that we are closed to new ideas and concepts.In my opinion, this episode borrowed concepts from aboriginal animism and Buddhism. The purpose seemed to be to encourage open mindedness.",8

She is beamed back to the ship but the Doctor has no idea how to bring her out of the coma. Captain Janeway demands information about the energy field but is told that only the monks may go near it and the secular government doesn't interfere with them. Researching the planets history a case is found of a king who when to the shrine to plead with the ancestral spirits to save his son who had been caught in the energy field. The captain argues successfully that she too should be allowed be plead her case; the monks agree. When she goes to the planet a woman who is to be her guide meets her. After going through a series of ordeals she believes she is ready to save Kes but she still won't come out of her coma; in the end she must make a leap of faith and do something that could kill both herself and Kes if she is wrong.While not the most exciting episode it was nice to see the captain have to rely on something other than science or engineering to solve a problem, it also made a nice change to see Chakotay take a sceptical stance and side with science rather than the spiritual rather than the captain.",7

17,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Sacred Ground (TV Episode 1996)",Star Trek and Not Knowing,"***WARNING*** This Review Contains SpoilersThere are many reviewers here who won't like this episode, simply because it steps on some (sacred) toes. This is a great story of Capt. Janeway as an explorer and scientist coming up against the limitations of one method or worldview -- the one she was brought up with. She now finds herself in a situation where it doesn't serve her. Many modern writers have written about how science has become like a religion in our culture. We ""believe"" whatever scientists say and take it as ""the truth"", regardless of the fact that history shows that we are only seeing a small part of reality and that scientists in 100 or 200 years will look back on our ""scientific truths"" and shake their heads. The same thing will happen to their ""scientific truths"" in an additional century or two. The episode 'Sacred Ground' questions our materialistic worldview and the ""belief"" that everything can be explained on a factual level. Janeway has experienced a ""not knowing"" that at the end has her questioning what she thought she knew. She isn't going to abandon science, just make room for some other perspectives. My favorite scene is at the end where the doctor is explaining scientifically how a crew member was able to recover and Janeway is hearing it as ""blah, blah, blah"", gobbledygook that tries to explain something that she knows she does not have an explanation for. If you have a problem with this episode, it may be because it questions something you hold to be true.",10

It was like reading Carlos Castenada back in the 70's with old Don Juan making pronouncements, allowing us to find truth. Of course, he was using peyote. Katherine pretty much becomes numb and is pushed along by fear and despair. Eventually, the spirits take over. We are to believe they are non-corporeal.

Why is the crew of Voyager touring sacred shrines when their ostensible goal is to GET HOME?!? Anyone? And was Estelle ""Mrs. Costanza"" Harris really the best choice to play one of the Gods?At least we're finally allowing spirituality... the mystery of the universe is at last acknowledged. But not really, 'cuz Doc has medi-babble to explain Kes' condition and ultimate cure. At the end of the episode even Janeway is disgusted by the scientific gobbledygook. A smart move on the writers' part, because if we know it all there's nothing to believe in, and no reason to leave our house let alone our galaxy.Considering the fact that all of the science in Trek- in which its characters beliefs are grounded- is pure fiction, it's only right to inject some humility and awe into a series that was built on open-mindedness and the joy of discovery.

20,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Sacred Ground (TV Episode 1996)","Worst episode of Trek ever. Yes, worse than Sub Rosa.","I'd rather watch Beverly have sex with a ghost than watch this episode of nonsense again. The pandering to religious garbage is a taint on the entire Trek universe. The stupidest part is that at the end they depict the doctor actually having a scientific understanding of the effects from the shrine because they were finally able to scan the shrine while the captain was taking Kes into it. The entire episode is trying to say that science doesn't have all the answers, yet the same episode admits that the only reason they didn't have the answers was because the idiots wouldn't let them just scan the shrine after Kes' accident.Listening to the elderly ""spirits"" sit there and belittle Janeway's ""blind faith"" in science was excruciating. The very point of science is that you don't need faith, let alone blind faith. You can follow a scientific argument from start to finish and it should have empirical data to back up all observations. The entirety of science is built around actively trying to disprove the things we think we know. The only way a scientific theory survives is if it can withstand attempt after attempt to falsify it until we just have to say ""well, we can't seem to prove this theory wrong yet"". It becomes the best theory we have until a better one comes along to expand on it or a better attempt to falsify it comes along and finally pokes a hole in it.Star Trek is one of the only science fiction shows to ever truly appreciate the scientific process. Sure it's not always perfect but until Sacred Ground you could at least say they were trying their best to depict science for what it really is. This episode flies in the face of everything Gene Roddenberry envisioned for Trek.I love Voyager. It's one of my favorite Trek series despite this blight of an episode. Thankfully the story writer for this one did not contribute anything else to Star Trek. I've never been so disgusted by an episode of Star Trek. Even the lowest quality episodes of Trek with nonsensical plots were more entertaining than this piece of cringeworthy trash.",1

Maybe if everyone stopped trying to analyze every single aspect of a sci-fi show it might be more palatable. Frankly, the worst episode of any Star Trek version is better than best episode of anything ever made for TV. I don't ""hate"" any episode, but there are some that I like a lot more. However, this one could have flowed better, and I didn't care for the end of it. I kind of expected Janeway and Tess to actually enter the altar, not just bump into it. So, keep showing this episode and I'll keep watching.",6
22,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Sacred Ground (TV Episode 1996)",How DARE someone write something Atheists disagree with!,"I am a serious Trekker. I watched TOS when it aired on NBC when I was 5 years old.In every episode, the writer has 43 to 50 minutes to set up an adventure, show struggles and resolve it, that's all. Star Trek is famous for having everything work itself out in that time period (or a little more in a double episode).There is ALWAYS a scientific explanation, even if they have to make up new words and new concepts to explain it.But Life isn't always like that. This episode takes a bold step and presents us with a situation where there appears to be no logical or scientific reason for the resolution. THIS DRIVES ATHEIST SCI-FI KNOW IT ALLS INSANE.See, people who watch Star Trek tend to think they are smarter than most of the public. They embrace science, almost as much as a spiritual person embraces a religion and will lose their minds if anyone presents something different from their view of science as being the answer to every question Life presents. (so much for scientific detachment and open mindedness.)Now, just because we don't understand something does not mean we should attribute a magical answer to it, but I believe there are many issues science cannot answer and will never answer. I do not believe this is totally a materialistic world. My point is, a lot of Atheists embrace Science as the answer to everything. These atheists do not want Star Trek to deviate from it's Science-Fiction roots. And the many low reviews and spirituality bashing of this episode bear testament to this. But I think this is a great episode. In the end of this episode, a usual champion of science is left humbled. She listens to the doctor hypothesize how Kes was cured, but the Captain, seems to know better. She seems to have been a witness to something that Science cannot explain. THAT my friends is a mature writer. That is someone who has seen something in Life. For when my fellow scientific and Atheist friends tell me I am a fool for not seeing things as they do, I can only smile and say, ""Well, maybe I have seen some things in Life that you have not.""",8
23,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Sacred Ground (TV Episode 1996)",Amusement paid for by Star Trek Fans,"This episode is the fly in the soup, flinging old mayonnaise in the face of people who are strong proponents of science and the hardcore Star Trek fans. The episode doesn't have so much of the flashy technology, the fight with a macro virus, the warp drive. Its the show of faith and believing for those who don't or do they? If your faith in something waivers because it isn't quite what you expected, do you abandon it for something else or do you continue to believe you can trust it? This is the underlying question in the episode. If this episode isn't what you expected, do you give up on the series and watch Two and a Half Men or do you continue to watch the series?Maybe its just my faith talking, but something like this wouldn't happen here on earth. So it becomes a little jab by the writers when they make this spiritual moment occur on another planet far on the other side of the galaxy in the future. What happens on Nechani's planet, stays on the Nechani's planet, its a little secret for the Captain. If this happened in the Federation, the spirits of the shrine would of been called Shrine Aliens.The subtle details in this episode make it more colorful and in depth from the dry log it appears to those who already had their expectations set. For example, in the episode Captain Janeway shows her own disrespect by immediately rushing in wanting to get the ritual done and swept under the rug. So they gave her what she expected through her own senses. I think it was a dirty trick how they made her go through the ritual and then pull the carpet out from under her just to show the ritual was made of ash. However the point was made she had faith and belief, it was invested in something else.They also made another jab this time at Chakotay's character for having his own doubts, but being a spiritual person himself. However his reaction would seem natural and complement the viewer's own reaction. They also show the doctor being a computer program of logical functions doesn't have faith. Its one of those episodes you would have to watch again a few years later.",8

However, Captain Janeway isn't about to just let them blow up the ship and in the process of fighting back, the captain of the temporal ship AND Voyager are sent back in time. Why they then arrive in 20th century Earth never did make much sense to me since they were in the Delta Quadrant.When crew from Voyager land on Earth they soon discover the time cop--but apparently he landed there a few decades earlier. Soon they realize that the problem with the time police is not due to them but a major jerk from the 20th century, Mr. Starling (Ed Begley, Jr.), who apparently discovered the time cop's damaged ship back in 1967 and has been exploiting the 29th century technology to become a mega-rich 'genius'. Can the landing party manage to beat this jerk using very futuristic technology combined with zero ethics? Guest starring along with Begley is Sarah Silverman who is rather cute as a 20th century lady who want to help Voyager. What I particularly liked about this one is seeing the landing party trying to fit in-- and landing at Venice Beach in California--which is well known for being almost like a freak show atmosphere (this is not meant as an insult). This is when Tuvok remarks ""We could have worn our Starfleet uniforms...I doubt if anyone would have noticed!"". In fact, several times Tuvok delivered some zingers. It also offers the first time for the Doctor to become completely mobile--using 20th century technology to be able to walk about on Earth unimpeded.

Can you please restore my original review. Thank you.Shortly after this episode aired, ""First Contact"" was shown in the theaters. The title of this pair of episodes becomes an important line, said by the Borg Queen. ""Watch your futures end""I thought that was nice how they took the name of this episode and put it into a feature film. In fact, the name of this episode appears in other places as well, it's a pivotal episode not just for voyager, but for Star Trek in general.So... Voyager goes back to a contemporary point in time, in this case 1996. Well, I don't care whether or not ""Star Trek 4 the voyage home"" did the same thing or that they even did something similar to this in deep space nine. Or that Star Trek discovery has a magic red angel suit that can bring them to any point in time, so what? This episode of Voyager is not any of those, and was not made like any of those, it's its own dog. And as such, it has a lot of very unique things in it. So stick a sock in your mouth whoever is saying ""this has already been done"", your negative review has already been done, and I'm pretty tired of reading it especially as it appears as if it was written by several different reviewers but in fact it was written by only one guy.I liked the original actor that played Captain Braxton, later, he is replaced by that guy who used to fly MacGyver around all the time, and he was good too (he was also in the movie Timecop as well), but I wish he would've done Captain Braxton originally. We get used to seeing an actor creating a character, and then later having to replace that actor with somebody new. It was even done in Game of Thrones, at least four times that I can remember. But I liked the guy who originally played Braxton, and I wish they would have used him when the character appeared later in the series.Voyager is attacked by a timecop from the 29th century (Braxton), who doesn't really want to give Janeway too many details about why he has to do such a thing. Other than ""Voyager was there"". Janeway is not going to allow her ship to be destroyed on the basis of a 10 second conversation, The resulting confrontation begins this conundrum.After that point, we get to see why that A to B to C thing comes into play- Braxton explains the thing beautifully in his new role as Bum. Wait, how did he get from Timecop, to Bum? I don't know, watch the episode.This episode has some very funny character actors and some very funny things in it including Sarah Silverman, very young, and she bounces off of Tom Paris beautifully. She's almost as whack as he is, so it's a match made in, wherever.This episode even has Alex Jones style conspiracy theorists getting their asses whomped, which is a beautiful thing to behold.And then it also has the guy from Saint elsewhere, Ed Begley Junior, in fact he's got the first line in this episode, and it's great.Another episode that I originally saw when it was first broadcast. One other very important thing occurs in this pair of episodes, as they say in Starship Troopers, ""do you want to know more?""",10

A Federation ship from the 29th Century emerges and attacks claiming that Voyager will be responsibly for a disaster in that time. Voyager resists the attack and both ships are thrown back in to the past. Voyager is now in orbit above 1997 Earth and there are signs that the time ship may be in Los Angeles. On the surface they find that Captain Braxton is living on the streets and his ship was stolen by the hippie we saw in the opening scene. He is now a successful businessman and has been using the future technology to help his computer business. A researcher working for Starling finds Voyager in orbit and sends a message assuming it must be an alien ship, Tom and Tuvok go to the Griffith Observatory to discover what she knows and to delete her records, things go a little wrong however when one of Starling's men turns up and tries to kill them all with a weapon that is clearly from far in the future. Meanwhile the Captain and Chakotay have broken into Starling's office and discovered that he plans to launch the timeship unfortunately they are caught soon after. They manage to beam out but in doing so they Voyager is spotted and when they try to take the timeship Starling manages to steal a lot of information from Voyager's computer... and a member of the crew! It was fun to see the away team exploring '90s LA, clearly inspired by Star Trek IV: The Return Home where Kirk and his crew end up in the '80s.

They soon realize that a megalomaniac named Starling (Ed Begley Jr.) is going to destroy the solar system in the 29th century. When they warn him, Starling seems indifferent--he just cares about himself and becoming rich off stealing future technology. Part two begins with Starling in custody and the away team looking for Starling's space craft which he intends to use to travel to the future. However, using 29th century technology that he stole, Starling escapes and there is a race to stop this giant butt from destroying everything.Like the other episode, this one is well made and clever...and well worth seeing.",9
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Future's End: Part II (TV Episode 1996)",Saving the future,"This second part of a two-part story was a lot of fun. As it opened it appeared that Starling had the upper hand; he has the Doctor and a lot of Voyager's computer files and Voyager is still not fully functional. Luckily Tom, Tuvok and Dr.Rain Robinson manage to contact Voyager and hatch a scheme to capture Starling. This works but in the process the shuttle transporting him from the surface is damaged and crashes in Arizona amongst some paranoid individuals who believe Chakotay and B'Elanna are working for the 'evil federal government'. Starling's henchman helps him beam off Voyager so it is up to Tom and Dr. Robinson to prevent him from launching the time ship assuming the ship is in the lorry they are following and it isn't all a trick so he can launch from his building.There were plenty of nice touches in this episode; first and foremost the Doctor gets a 29th Century mobile holographic emitter that enables to go where he wants and means that in future episodes he won't be tied to sickbay and the holodecks, we also learn that computer technology and the internet are all based on technology that Starling extracted from the timeship. It was rather a shame in the end that Dr. Robinson didn't get to go up to Voyager and see the rings of Saturn close up but I think this was probably the right thing; it isn't always good to give the audience what they want.",8

There is a great set of characters. Ed Begley, Jr. is a formidable foe. Paris finds the woman he never thought he'd meet and is victimized by the time/space continuum. The crew must infiltrate Los Angeles in the late 20th Century to put a stop to the launch of a time traveling ship. The action, suspense, and the cleverness of the plot all come together. There is something intriguing about people trying to cope in a world with which they have little experience. The Doctor is again engaged in the plot and I especially liked his encounter with the survivalists.",10
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Future's End: Part II (TV Episode 1996)","Beware Of Egg Begley, Jr.","(Please Note: This is my review for both parts of the two-part episode ""Future's End."")Future's End is a beautiful time-travel episode which involves the crew of Voyager traveling to present-day Earth in order to stop a time-traveler from destroying their ship. If Voyager ever made a major motion picture, this is the script on which it should have been based.Packed with story, fast-moving, and genuinely funny, this is Star Trek at its best. Sure, human cancer Sarah Silverman guest-starred as the astronomer, and yes, Egg Begley, Jr's role as evil technocrat was rushed and slightly under-developed, but there's so much here to love: A time ship from century 29 set to destroy Voyager for the good of mankind... Tuvok dressed like a brother from the hood... Kes and Neelix watching soap operas...Okay, so Voyager should be better protected against a 1996 IBM desktop and the Doc's mobile emitter was the first step in the over-use and eventual abuse of the Doctor character, but this is too fun to nitpick.GRADE: A",10
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Future's End: Part II (TV Episode 1996)",One of the best Voyager episodes.,"This two-parter is one of the best Voyager has to offer. It's right up there with Year Of Hell. Sarah Silverman is a riot and the juxtaposition of Tuvok and the rest of the Voyager crew against the 20th century setting is pretty entertaining. I enjoyed Henry Starling's character as well because he seemed to sell the plausibility of his technical prowess quite convincingly. It also helps that he had like 30 years to study the technology so props to the writers for that detail.There's just one little issue I have with the whole thing. Captain Braxton is a moron. He comes to the 24th century and just straight up tells Voyager his mission is to destroy them and is then surprised when they resist. For a 29th century dude he sure is dim XDOh and the dudes that are afraid of ""the beast"" (meaning the government) were way too over the top. And that's saying something considering they are portraying a stereotype of irrational conspiracy theorists.",9
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Warlord (TV Episode 1996)",Jennifer Lien steals the show,"A truly breath-taking acting performance here by Jennifer Lien.Normally her Voyager character Kes is underplayed, sympathetic and innocent (and she is always very effective, if rarely exciting as a goody-two-shoes).This episode, however, turns the angelic Kes on her head, and she really sells an entirely different and conflicted character with a combination of incredible energy and nuance.The story itself isn't anything special (which accounts for the good-but-not-great 8/10 rating), but in my opinion this is one of the best performances by any regular cast member in any Star Trek series.",8

Things get more serious soon enough though when a ship Voyager is trying to help explodes, they beam out three personnel over to Voyager but one soon dies in sickbay. Kes soon makes friends with the two survivors. When a representative of their planets beams up to Voyager to thank them for helping Kes kills him and escapes along with the two survivors and overthrows the planet's ruler; it turns out the man who died was Tieran, a former ruler who somehow transferred his consciousness into Kes. While Voyager tries to rescue Kes she is fighting back herself in an attempt to regain control of her mind and body.This was a really good episode; it was great to see Jennifer Lien get to show a greater acting range as she plays Kes while possessed by Tieran, she came across as surprisingly forceful as Kes tried to retake control. There were scenes that rather surprised me, particularly when Tieran used Kes's powers to attack somebody causing him to bleed profusely from his eyes and nose.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Warlord (TV Episode 1996)",She is the best actress from all the Star Trek episodes,"I got a chance to see Jennifer Lien at the Las Vegas convention August 2010. Seeing her with the crew reminded me of my favorite Voyager episode, ""Warlord"". The episode was well written. The music and camera angles were fabulous. The scenes were right out of our typical everyday struggle within ourselves....shall we fall to our desire to control others or shall we compromise with the good within us. Each scene stretched her talents to massive audition proportions. If only the directors could watch this episode. We'd see her on the BIG Screen with consistency. The scene that hit me personally was when ""Kes"" and ""Nelix"" were discussing, ""..her desire to make friends without his involvement"". The, ""Kiss with Tuvok"", scene was very surprising! The ""Warlord"" episode showed her to be a great convincing talented actress. It also showcased her then as she is still today...a beautiful, talented and versatile actress. I hope to see her in some major movies.",10
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Warlord (TV Episode 1996)",Surprisingly Subversive Episode,"An early episode of Voyager that accidentally touches on a rather subversive topic, ""Warlord"" is fairly interesting and features a strong performance from Jennifer Lien. Someday, Lien is going to win an award for Best Underused Actress ever - a talented girl, she was forced to play Kes more or less like a soft spoken Vulcan for most of the show.Finally, in ""Warlord"" she gets to have a little fun. Without giving too much away, a dying warlord transfers his consciousness into Kes and uses her body to stage a coup on his planet. Here's where the subversion kicks in: the Warlord is a man, but he seems to adjust to his new life inside a woman's body without the slightest problem. With hardly any effort, he uses his new body as a sexual weapon - far from a ""warlord"", he is more like a femme fatal, trying to use his new body to seduce everyone in sight (At one point, the possessed Kes even kisses Tuvok). The warlord's wife is naturally a little disturbed by this, and frankly the Warlord doesn't seem all that interested in her even though she seems to be the only woman on the whole planet.I suppose you could chalk this up to lazy directing, but let's give them the benefit of the doubt. The show comes pretty close to giving us a lesbian kiss and the Kes / Tuvok kiss is reminiscent of the Kirk / Uhura moment thirty years before. Voyager never really broke new ground as a show, but it's nice to see them inching towards doing the thing that Star Trek was pretty much created to do: using science fiction to comment on our own culture.I'll warn you: there's the usual laziness in this episode that was typical of Voyager throughout the entire seres. Voyager tended to shy away from any real creativity regarding creating alien cultures: the make up is lazy and the alien ""society"" is pretty much a carbon copy of our own, right down to the notion of the first born male heir inheriting the throne.",7
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Warlord (TV Episode 1996)",Jennifers' best episode.,"In this episode of the range of the actress is stretched to her utter limits.It also changes the character irrecoverably.The whole thing is kind of a shock, because we don't know what's really going on and then all of a sudden Kes starts doing some very uncharacteristic things.She even takes Tuvoc's teachings and uses them against him. Nothing can be taken for granted in this episode, things that would have worked before, will not work now.But the real battle is going on within Kes herself.This episode also changes her relationship with Neelix for the remainder of the time the character appears in the show. She is now a mature woman, at three years old. And it's also possible that this encounter gives Kes access to some of that incredibly dark stuff from ""Cold Fire"", because after this point she really starts coming into her mental and telekinetic abilities.But there is no other way to say this: Kes has been violated, there was a stronger word that I can use but I'm pretty sure that bean counters at IMDb rejected my original review because I used that word. it is the most appropriate word for what has happened to Kes. But she does not accept the role of ""victim"" willingly, and in the end she proves to be the one who is stronger.I'm sure my previous review had all kinds of spoilers in it, I don't really want to do that this time. But I am pretty sure that there were a few insights in that old review that were pretty important, which is why I want to see it back, thank you. Nothing makes me angrier than when I come in here to look over an episode that I had previously reviewed, and my original review has magically disappeared without any notification.",10
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Warlord (TV Episode 1996)","Kes could use a bit of Dale Carnegie (""How to Win Friends and Influence People"") in this one...","When the show begins, Voyager discovers a ship that's about to explode. Naturally, being galactic goody-goodies, the ship swoops in to rescue the three person crew--even though they were at serious risk for being killed in the process. One of them seems beyond help but the other two are fine. What Voyager does NOT realize is that the dead crew member is a megalomaniac jerk who is a disposed despot. In his dying moments, he secretly places his consciousness into Kes. Soon, Kes and the two survivors steal a shuttle and head back to the home planet to take over and take revenge on everyone. Soon authorities who are seeking the despot arrive. When they hear what has occurred, they want to work with Voyager. Voyager wants to rescue Kes and the authorities just want to kill her...just in case.It's nice to see Kes behaving like a sociopathic jerk--it was a welcome relief to her usual nice persona and must have been fun for Jennifer Lien. Her husky voice, promiscuity, nasty demeanor and overall yechiness was a nice change of pace, that's for sure. So is the show worth seeing because of this? Yes, but logically, I would have just shot Kes/despot in the face and points to the usual problem with ""Star Trek: Voyager""--they cannot ever make a sacrifice and they always wait to have a magical solution. Additionally, seeing Kes and the despot arguing with each other inside Kes' head is pretty dull--and very talky. But, on the other hand, the blood out of the eye socket and fun over-acting was pretty cool and on balance it's pretty good.",7

How would this be done? So we just accept some scientific gobbledegook. Is there anything in our experience that would ever make this a possible reality? Here, Kes gets to be a warlord by the dead one inhabiting her body. She does a very good acting job. I appreciated the facial expressions and the body language. The problem for me is that the whole thing was just very dull.",6
7,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Warlord (TV Episode 1996)",Kes Goes Lesbo,"Kes- who typically has no character to speak of- is possessed by a violent warlord and becomes a loathsome and despicable monster.Yes, Kes is inhabited by a crazed man, and spends the episode dripping with testosterone and anger until the eventual undoing. The Doc's medi-babble is really starting to annoy me here: Isn't the migration of Tieran's soul into Kes' body more spiritual than scientific? Nope. Not when Doc can lecture us about weakened neural patterns and synaptic stimulators. Turns out ANYTHING is medically possible on Voyager, but the Doc only finds out about it AFTER it's been done.Kes, meanwhile comes close to kissing a woman as she re-takes her throne and rules brutally over her subjects before the eventual return to herself. Who else wanted to see a soft, sweet, sopping girl-on-girl make-out session? Put your hands down.In the blink-and-you'll-miss-it conversation that occurs afterward she apparently breaks up with Neelix, though that fact is not clearly stated and never even referenced again until the episode ""Darkling.""

8,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Warlord (TV Episode 1996)",One of my favorite Voyager episodes,"Voyager comes across a disabled ship about to be destroyed and beams the three crew aboard. One perishes and transfers his consciousness to Kes. Kes now as the dead warlord and his crew escape and take over the rule of the alien world by killing the ruling member, his servants and son. The remaining son arrives on Voyager wanting help to stop the warlord (occupying Kes) by any means possible. Tuvok unsuccessfully tries to rescue Kes and it is left to her to fight the warlord off mentally. Eventually the remaining son & Voyager crew successfully defeat the warlord & his allies and the warlord's consciousness is ultimately destroyed using a medical device from Voyager. The episode ends with Tuvok helping a rattled Kes resettle her emotional and mental state following her release from the warlord's mind.Having watched this episode again after becoming a fan of Game of Thrones, I can't help but draw parallels between Warlord Kes & Jack Gleason's tyrant king Joffery. Jennifer Lien does an incredible 180 from her usual soft spoken, very kind character when possessed by the warlord and she not only shines, but sparkles playing the tyrant ruler showing her exceptional acting prowess. Warlord Kes is violent, cruel, irrational and even provocative with a side dish of a schizo-spectrum disorder. It is excellent to watch as over the course of the episode she slowly struggles as she regains control of herself by battling the warlord's mind.One can watch an actor play a similar role across episodes and the viewer can become settled or even bored by the character, but the great thing about Star Trek is the possibility of the same character acting in bizarre ways allowing the player to show their superb acting range. Another Voyager episode I really enjoy this on is Living Witness where people in a distant future envision an evil version of Voyager played out so well by a new evil Janeway and crew.",9

For the captain the joy is short lived as when she returns to her quarters she finds she has a visitor. It is Q and he has an unappealing proposition; he wishes to mate with her! She is sure that there is more to his proposal than first meets the eye and soon we learn that he already has a partner, a female Q who is unimpressed with his desire to mate with a lesser species. Their arguments are put on hold when Voyager encounters further supernovas. Q takes Janeway to the Continuum where he explains that the novas aren't natural but are the by-product of a civil war within the Continuum. So that Janeway, and the audience, can understand the nature of their war it is viewed as though it was the American Civil War, with Q a Union officer and those who oppose change taking the role of the Confederates. While Janeway is trying to resolve the civil war the female Q is trying to bring Voyager to the Continuum.This wasn't one of my favourite episodes; even though John de Lancie does a fine job in the role of Q I'm not too keen on the character or the Continuum as a whole. There was one good laugh though when we learn what sex entails for the Q; I won't spoil it but will say that when Janeway learnt what it involved she didn't think she'd missed much by turning Q down.",6
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Q and the Grey (TV Episode 1996)",Silly but enjoyable fluff,"This is what I would call a slight episode, that's for sure. The plot really does nothing to advance the overall theme of the show and is one you could easily skip. Now I am NOT saying you should skip it--it's enjoyable and silly fun.When the show begins, Q unexpectedly arrives and tries to woo Janeway into being the carrier of his seed. Yep, Q wants to make love to the Captain so that he can have a child! Naturally, his motives are far more complicated than just a desire for a booty call, and the Captain is having none of this. However, through the course of the show, she also comes to realize that perhaps something like this is necessary, as there's a civil war brewing in the Continuum and perhaps a child might heal the rift.This is a silly little show--one that you'll either enjoy (if you like the Q characters) or you'll probably find annoying. All I know is that I like these shows and they are a welcome relief from the ultra-seriousness of most episodes of ""Voyager"".",7

The return of Suzie Plakson (from TNG)- this time as a Q- is fun, as well as the Old South representation of the ongoing battle.Some nice story beats keep this episode alive until the very end, and the final scene in which Q plays with his infant son is sweet and funny.

3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Q and the Grey (TV Episode 1996)",Star Trek: Voyager - Q and the Grey,"Follow-up to the excellent, Death Wish, has John De Lancie returning to his most famous role, Q, wanting to stop a civil war within the Continuum, caused by his lead of a freedom rally among those of omnipotent nature wanting to embrace individualism, hoping Janeway will procreate a child with him! Meanwhile the civil war is causing supernovas in the galaxy, certain to harm the Voyager if this ordeal isn't solved. Arriving to balk in her superior-to-puny-mortals attitude is a female Q (Suzie Plakston, who is good fun), calling Q to task for choosing Janeway as romantic mate over her! Q, hoping to convince Janeway, takes her to the battlefront where the old- fashioned Q (dressed as the Confederacy) wage war with him, articulating the conflict in a format of the American Civil War, De Lancie representing the Union! When De Lancie is hit by a bullet and bleeds, Janeway knows the situation is dire, not helped by Harve Presnell's Colonel Q who seems unyielding in resolving matters with violence. Whether or not Q having a ""Baby Jane"" is conclusively silly, I think De Lancie is such a delight to watch, and his repartee with decisively opposing Janeway so much fun, the episode is hard to resist. Plakston annoying the Voyager crew also included, only adds to the joy of it all. I especially liked Torres not taking her lip, certainly offering barbs at her over losing the Q powers, with Plakston amused at her spunk. Tuvok and Chakotay tolerating her bold remarks and commands, pointing out she needs them just as much as they need her is a pleasant development considering how the Q omnipotence is always shoved in the face of mortals. But this series should be commended for further developing the story of the Q and the never-aging De Lancie doesn't miss a beat. Seeing Q evolve also, as he does when seeing Quinn die previously in Death Wish and pleads with Presnell to spare Janeway's life in this episode has been a real pleasure. Q could have ended with the culmination of the Next Generation run, but Voyager further continued his story...and this fan of the character is happy they did! The baby introduced to Janeway might have been a bit much, but De Lancie charms with the boy on his knee, and this episode extends their relationship beyond just a god annoying a starship captain. That intercourse between Q be a touch of fingers is fitting with how they operate.",7
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Q and the Grey (TV Episode 1996)","Voyager saves the Q Continuum, neglects to ask for a ride home in return","The Q Continuum is in the middle of a civil war, and Q (the usual one) thinks that the way to end a civil war is by making a Q baby. That makes perfect sense to Captain Janeway, who endorses this clever plan, because babies are the way to save a society of childish gods as well as a marriage.Of course it takes a while for this to happen, because the Continuum's Civil War is urgent business (causing supernovae along the way) so naturally Q wastes half an episode pretending to court the captain.
Voyager's first Q episode was dealing with heavy issues, so it was easy to overlook all the things that usually make Q-centric episodes kinda lame. Here, without a serious subject matter, there is the typical lighthearted approach by John De Lancie (who grows on you after 20 or so episodes across Star Treks), but not much else. A silly civil war by a bunch of silly deities that keep revolving around humans. A series of supernovae, which would presumably not be happening solely around Voyager, so you know, quadrillions of dead in Federation space. And of course, a Captain Janeway that, having helped saved the Q Continuum, does not even think of asking if this grateful omnipotent god would maybe get them home.",6

Of course, this is what we have with the gods of Greek mythology (or any mythology for that matter). When they have nothing to do and become bored, the wreak havoc on the poor mortals. I've never cared much for Q or his ilk and want to see the episodes speed along. In this one, the object of his affection is, again, Captain Janeway.

Once aboard it is like the Marie Celeste, no sign of the crew. Exploration reveals that there is an alien on board; it is clearly dangerous as it burnt its way through the deck. Soon Neelix is attacked and infected by an alien, the captain leaves him to find a med kit but when she returns he is gone. She then strips down to her vest and arms herself with as much as she can carry before setting off to find the rest of the crew. When she finds The Doctor she learns that the aliens are in fact a macro-virus that boarded the ship after they replied to a mayday from a mining colony. Once on board everybody was soon infected and although the doctor found a cure the viruses were so big that they could stop him administering it.This was an exciting episode that felt like a homage to 'Alien' as the captain crawled through the Jeffries Tubes while something dangerous could be around any corner. The solution of luring the viruses to the holodeck so that is could attack the scantily clad holo-characters was amusing if somewhat gratuitous. Kate Mulgrew do a good job turning Captain Janeway into an action hero and the giant viruses were suitably scary making this a good episode.",9

I though Janeway was a nice copy of Sigourney Weaver here. The Doctor has become a bit of a liability at times because of his newfound freedoms. I also agree that getting home is the primary need, but, by the same token, if all they did was fly through space with no obstacles, it would be rather boring. Those that are so bent out of shape by this better get used to it. There has to be a plot. Now I have not problem with criticism of the crazy medical stuff and the fast creation of antigens and miracle cures. Still, it was pretty entertaining.",8
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Macrocosm (TV Episode 1996)",Attack of the giant germs!,"A very nice extended opening sequence and first act, with Janeway wandering the eerie deserted dark corridors of the ship, trying to figure out what manner of disaster has befallen her unfortunate vessel this time. Everyone looking a little sweaty somehow adds a lot to the tension. I love the way the commonplace sight of the ship can suddenly become such an creepy place when devoid of crew and with a mysterious sinister element lurking about unseen. Another good example of this type of atmosphere is the season 6 episode ""one"". For me, I don't find that all the tension disappears and it get boring when it gets to the scene where the Doc explains everything. I enjoy that part, you've got to find out what's going on at some point. To me the moment the suspense is truly drastically altered is the instant the creatures are revealed. It just about does the trick, but I still find the climax with the big green fireball ""antigen bomb"" a little rushed and iffy. And I just know they don't expect you to believe that every single last one of the organisms was on the holodeck! It's just too damn bad the explosion didn't disable Neelix's stupid gay holoprogram once and for all! I love the funny mellowed-out classy ending. That's one captain who earns her coffee! ::: I can't think of too many other episodes of this show where the big threat was plague. That sets it apart somewhat. The little flying monster-sized germs are very memorable and suitably gross-I think that whenever you're dealing with little monsters, having them spray slimy gunk on everything is generally a big plus! Yes, the cgi looks a bit dodgy now, but I still think the things look really cool, they're menacing and still work. It's the buzzing sound that sells the effect. I just can't stand bees and wasps, they make me run around in circles! And it was always good to see something on the show that wasn't yet another humanoid alien. I really like the hilariously camp and theatrical Tak-Tak aliens, who only seemed able to communicate through the magic of interpretive dance! They said everything all backwards. Like Yoda. ::: The Captain is stripped down to a tank top, she's toting a friggin' cannon and she's all outta bubble gum... And what d'ya know, she actually had buppies under that severe uniform all along! I thought it came off more like a homage to Ripley in Aliens than a rip-off. Most of the time Janeway as a character is strong, composed, commanding and authoritative, which is great and is why she's the captain, but in this one she truly goes above and beyond and really gets down and dirty and fights hard to save her crew and ship. Perhaps just as important, Mulgrew as an actress showed that she could hold an entire episode pretty much entirely by herself, and you don't get sick of looking at her. The same really couldn't be said for quite a few other members of the cast. She really is the best thing about this episode. Spiritually or technologically speaking, it's not all that much of a smart Voyager outing, nor a particularly character-advancing one-unless you count the fact that we now know exactly how much ass the captain can kick when push comes to shove! But these minor shortcomings do not prevent Macrocosm from being one of the most fun and entertaining entries of the third season, and I thoroughly love it for what it is. Thank you! Bzzz...",8

Even Janeway herself has stated in previous episodes that Voyager has to be realistic in their dealings, and that their extraordinary situation supersedes precedent and procedure. Anyway, Janeway gets back to the ship to discover giant squid-like creatures have paralyzed her crew, breeding inside them and using their necks as hives from which the infant insects emerge.Somebody must have been watching old movies because Janeway strips to her sweat & bloodied T-shirt to fight off the bad guys with her big ray gun. It's part Ripley from ""Alien,"" part John McClane from ""Die Hard."" Once again the Doctor is overused, and gives us a flashback explanation of how the infestation started which brings the entire narrative to a screeching halt.Doc also gives us pages and pages of medi-babble as he whips up an antigen to the virus. Why they insisted on referring to this as a ""virus"" when it was clearly a fly or insect that grew into a squid is beyond me. Janeway and Doctor save the day, and we're on our way...GRADE: C-",4

The other episode that is kind of like this is ""The Fight"", which starts at the end, then backs up and then tells the whole story piecemeal.This episode has an interesting premise, where the microscopic jumps into the macroscopic. Things that are small should never be made larger, either accidentally or intentionally.It also serves as a kind of warning against something like that happening in the real world, if something like this were to happen here somehow, our ecosystem would be taken over and destroyed by such an event. Fortunately, I can't think of any instance that would cause events similar to what are depicted here to happen in real life. Even if it did, I don't think any life form that ""jumped quantums"" like that would be able to survive in the new environment. However, as they say in Jurassic Park, ""life will find a way""- so the best thing is to never let it happen in the first place.And in fact it only happens here due to a fluke.In regard to the title of my review, refer to the Game of Thrones episode called ""Blackwater"", and then look for something similar in this episode of Voyager.",10

Then, flying insects come out of the victims! Yuck! Neelix disappears and somehow is made whole and returns to Voyager? How? A plot hole you could drive a Federation Starship through! Nice to see Capt. Janeway all striped-down into combat mode, like Laura Croft. Great well-defined arms. Not seen very often this way. Where did that newly-designed laser rifle come from? Just remember to zap the leftover bugs on the holodeck with bio-engineered ""Raid"".The Doctor (Robert Picardo) continues to grow as an effective series character.

If Voyager is lost in the Delta Quadrant and they are trying to get back home, WHY do they keep taking all these unnecessary side trips? And, why do they keep going off on rescue missions when they are in need of rescue themselves?! Here in ""Macrocosm"" the Captain and Neelix are off on some unneeded diplomatic mission and the ship goes off on a rescue mission that, not surprisingly, just about destroys the ship! The end result--the ship gets infected with some weird virus that assumes HUGE sizes and is awfully difficult to destroy.So what's to like about this one? Well, there is a lot of slime and we do get to see Janeway actually killing something and acting tough (both are VERY rare). Otherwise, the show just doesn't make a lot of sense AND the aliens they negotiate with are among the most annoying in Trek history. Not terrible but certainly far from good.",5

The ending was also horrible and no one addressed the fact that the alien vessel that attacked Voyager ""purified"" the colony that was infected which they both instantly forgot because ""happy ending"" by throwing a anti agent bomb in the holo deck.

This simple desire leads to a confluence of unexpected consequences built on a lie. Good Neelix episode focuses almost exclusively on him and it is a great opportunity for Ethan Phillips to give us his range as an actor, no matter how covered in makeup and prosthetics he might be. The crew needs supplies to help sustain system controls on the Voyager, arriving at a trading space station right before the Expanse. Bahrat (Carlos Carrasco) runs the station, his eyes constantly monitoring the activities for criminality, not knowing that narcotics are moving right under his nose. He demands 20% commission for all major trades because it is his station providing the venue. Neelix encounters an old friend from the past, Wixiban (James Nardini), a trader roughing it, an agent (middle man) helping in the movement of narcotics, seizing upon his friend's insecurities and vulnerabilities. Neelix was once a dealer in contraband, having put that past behind him by the time he reached the Voyager. However, ""Wix"" did take the blame for a trade that went awry, putting him in prison without giving up Neelix as an accomplice. So Neelix is willing to help him ""trade medical supplies"" at a part of the station Bahrat has weaknesses detecting, but the recipient doesn't intend on paying, pulling a phaser, with Wix (who took a phaser from the Voyager), having to kill him in self defense. Eventually Wix must satisfy the species who provided the narcotics to deal by convincing Neelix to steal some warp plasma from Voyager.The plot thickens through a domino effect all stemming from trying to get a map. Janeway's reaction to Neelix's admission, and how she informs him that he will be assigned menial tasks as a result of his misbehavior is an amusing close to the episode; Neelix is shown here that he's part of the crew, not worthless. His sins of the past come to light and yet he's part of a family, a crew that he will indeed remain a vital part of. Carrasco is all sure of himself as the station operations specialist but he's made aware that he doesn't quite have the place as buttoned down as he might thinkhis premature arrest of Chakotay and Paris (they just talked with the murdered Sutok their first day on the station, a mere passing that lasted seconds) prove that he might ought to acquire some help to monitor things. Nardini makes for a perfect underhanded smuggler/mediator/trader of illegal items, using whatever means available to attain the kind of transaction that selfishly benefits himhis Wix sees Neelix and his association with the Voyager as the perfect foil to exploit. Neelix's guilt and inability to take from those that trust him unveils a noble character no longer similar to Wix, having found principles and purpose beyond supplying for his own needs. Janeway does challenge him. My favorite scene: Neelix asks Paris about his prison time and the conversation about how lying simply isn't worth it.",7

In his effort to find value, he commits a near treasonous act, getting unwittingly involved with intergalactic drug smugglers.

He's also ship's Cook, morale officer and hosts a daily talk show for the crew. Does this sound like a man who has no place on the ship? But the plot demands that Neelix be desperate to prove his usefulness, so he embarks on a scheme to obtain a map which leads to his trading drugs and being asked to steal plasma from Voyager's warp engine. Naturally...This is a decent episode but it is fairly obvious that no one on the ship is safe from being killed off, fired or recast. Many of the episodes this season bring each character to the brink of death or disaster several times over. It looks like they're trying to bring each character to their breaking point, to test their fictional relevance, and it's this kind of uncertainty and doubt that make the show very difficult to watch at times.Can't we have an episode in which a character isn't threatened with death or catastrophe? Just one? Neelix eventually finds his emotional core and manages to escape punishment for his wrong-doing by nailing even bigger criminals... what luck!

Before entering the expanse they think it would be wise to stock up on needed supplies so go to a nearby space station. While trying to acquire a map of the Expanse Neelix meets Wicks, an old friend, who claims he can get one along with other needed supplies. He says he is trading medical supplies for the items but it soon becomes clear that he is actually dealing drugs. The deal goes wrong and the man they were trading with ends up dead. Chakotay and Paris are arrested as they were seen talking to him earlier; Neelix can't see his friends gaoled so decides to tell the truth and attempt to keep his freedom by offering to help entrap the main drug suppliers operating on the station.This was a good episode where it looked as if Neelix was genuinely concerned about his position on Voyager because they would soon be entering space he had no knowledge of.

This proves to be a waste of time (after all he IS Neelix) and so his plan is to buy a map of the upcoming portion of space where the ship is headed....but it ends up leading to LOTS of complications when Neelix relies on an old friend to help him get the map. This episode is odd because Mr. Vorik, the Vulcan, is seen for the first time. So you are expected to believe that after three seasons you just haven't seen him before. Yeah, right.

Notice I say ""little"" danger. When the Marayna character breaks free of the Holodeck and takes over the ship, none of the crew is terrorized, tortured or brought to the brink of death. Just enough trouble to propel the story to the next act, which it does brilliantly.I loved the story beats going from Kim's infatuation with Marayna to Tuvok's... it was very well-handled and kept me guessing all the way through. It also proves that even Vulcans appreciate a great pair of melons. Tim Russ is great as a Vulcan... it seems to come second-nature to him, and he doesn't shy away from the genuine hostility that would arise from dealing with emotional humans.

That evening Neelix organises a party for the crew on the holodeck and Tuvok attends despite not being keen on the idea. When he gets there he is surprised to find Marayna playing a Vulcan game; they get involved in a conversation and it is clear that she understands the way he thinks and appears to think the same way herself. It soon becomes clear that she is becoming obsessed with Tuvok; when he deletes her character she transfers herself to sickbay and steals the Doctor's mobile emitter. It then becomes apparent that she is no ordinary holodeck character but is some how connected to the phenomenon that Voyager had been exploring.As this episode got underway it seems like it was just an excuse to return to Neelix's Beach program that is populated by beautiful women with minimal clothing. While that might be true Marayna was an interesting character, she certainly didn't behave like any of the other holodeck characters. When it is revealed just what Marayna is it was a nice surprise, I'd been expecting another clichéd hologram malfunction.

Tuvok reluctantly attends the luau becoming compelled by Marayna who sizes him up analytically well. Soon Marayna is obsessed with Tuvok and uses The Doctor's mobile emitter (which allows holographic characters to move about the ship) to visit him in his quarters for a game of kal-toh (mentally challenging game where order is sought in chaos). Soon, the ship malfunctioning occurring since arriving at the nebula and Marayna is determined by Janeway and crew to be linked, with Tuvok key to halting the potential of Voyager's destruction. Kim and Tuvok in a rather unanticipated triangle with what is at first perceived to be a computer subroutine sure is quite a lead-in for the episode, directed by The Doctor himself, Robert Picardi!

Slight, but fun...seeing Torres, Paris, and Tuvok under attack from holographic Hawaiians at a luau as a lei is used as a means to choke is just too funny.

But our Kathryn is far too wily and naturally suspicious to ever allow herself to truly be manipulated in such a way by anyone, even if they're wearing the guise of her own deceased father. Apart from the end, my favourite part is the entire sequence where she's led to believe that she's passed on and is a spirit watching over the grieving crew, there's a couple of really touching scenes. I don't count Harry Kim's ridiculous and drawn-out ""berry"" speech, although Janeway was certainly moved by it, maybe I'm missing something.. I did find it moving what Tuvok says after Kes leaves, that did get me a bit misty-eyed. Anyway the plot just smoothly builds upon itself so superbly that when it gets to the climactic scene where Janeway puts her foot down and says: ""Let me tell you this, we can stand here for all eternity..."" I'm just riveted every time, in my opinion it's one of the best episodes in terms of atmosphere that they ever put out, and it's a great little showcase for Captain Janeway's tenacity and fearlessness.

When Chakotay returns to the ship with Janeway's body, attempts to resurrect her fail, and a move to interact with telepathic Kes leads nowhere. Soon, emerging from this rift of light, is Janeway's ""father"" (Len Cariou), encouraging her to abandon her crew and follow him into eternity, a consciousness of everlasting joy. But Janeway isn't ready to let go and ""move on"".Odd premise aside (and the time loops at the beginning certainly would seem to introduce a far different plot than what eventually occurs), there is a nicely poignant ""funeral"" where Torres and Kim speak warm and lovingly about their Captain as others solemnly reflect on her time with them. The euthanasia scene where Picardi's Doctor ""gases"" Janeway when she suffers the phage is particularly a bizarre sequence, as are the use of the Vidiians (maneuvers with the shuttlecraft as the Vidiians' warships attack produce brief space excitement), merely bit players in a much larger story involving a type of ""death alien entity"" hoping Janeway will give in and follow him into his ""matrix"". Janeway ""cheating death"" by staring him down and seeing past the ""disguise"" trying to manipulate her is rather ironic as Star Trek Captains often do just thatwith this time literally squaring off with death. Cariou is really a smart choice to portray a simulation of Janeway's father, producing enough presence and command worthy of a great man influential in the development of a sterling starship captain, yet gradually slips those qualities away until his motives are revealed. Janeway refusing to give up, dogged in returning to her crew, and seeing behind the façade, is what I thought was the episode's greatest asset. Just Kate Mulgrew giving us that range of emotions, enduring quite the roller coaster, leaving the episode full of enthusiasm, as if granted a lease on life she plans to enjoy with Chakotay agreeing, happily, to join her in a bit of entertainment during some downtime. I really liked the little moments of Janeway following Torres and Kim as they work on the theory of her caught in some type of anomaly and seeing Tuvok using a Vulcan telepathic meld with Kes that results in disappointment. I especially liked her response to Tuvok, entering a log about his failure in finding her presence through Kes. Cariou using methods of desperate pleading after softly trying, with Janeway unyielding in her defiance, is also quite fun.

There certainly is precedent for this, as LeVar Burton and Jonathan Frakes (both from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" both directed quite of few episodes of the various Trek series.When the show begins, Vorik* is entering the Pon Farr--the Vulcan mating season. Like Spock in the classic episode of ""Star Trek"", this is a highly illogical and violent period. In Vorik's clumsy attempt to begin the mating ritual with an uninterested B'Elanna, however, it sets of a HUGE problem that only becomes apparent later- -it creates the same Pon Farr rage within her! To make things much worse, this becomes obvious on an away team mission and she is one frisky and out of control woman! Her crazed state soon results in not only creating enemies with a new race they encounter but she and Paris become stuck in a cave after a cave-in and there's no telling what is next! However, I was very happy about the closing scene where a really, really interesting enemy's presence in the Delta Quadrant is introduced!This is a pretty exciting episode of the series--well directed and full of enough action and mayhem to keep the viewer's interest.*I have no idea why Vorik was introduced on the show but it seemed very awkward. While he'd never been a presence on the ship before, only a few episodes back (in the midst of season 3) he suddenly becomes a somewhat regular member of the cast. I wish they'd introduced him better and more realistically instead of acting as if he was ALWAYS there!",8
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Blood Fever (TV Episode 1997)",HERE WE GO AGAIN..,"I watched the first episode in which we encountered the problem of ""pon farr""---the Vulcan time of mating---and I found it absorbing, the way this problem was explored, and particularly the way in which Captain Kirk got Spock to talk about it and what it was doing to him. If you recall, Kirk, after telling Spock ""I haven't heard a word you said"", took action, with the help of navigator Sulu, to get the beleaguered Vulcan home in time to cope with his situation. This second excursion into pon farr---and its accompanying phenomenon of ""blood fever"", or ""plak-tow"" in Vulcan, was more violent---and somehow less satisfying in how it was dealt with: the one exception being that B'Elanna Torres was able to choose herself as the defender, and it was fun to see her, with her Klingon half galvanized into action, fighting it out with Vorik, with the end result being that both fell exhausted at the end, thus breaking the grip of the pon farr. I can't help feeling sorry for the poor Vulcans who every seven years have to go through this.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Blood Fever (TV Episode 1997)",Star Trek: Voyager - Blood Fever,"Strong direction (from Dirty Harry's own Andrew Robinson!) and good storytelling really produces a gem in this Vulcan-themed episode of Voyager. So a Vulcan officer is suffering the seven-year Pon Farr, requesting B'Elanna to be his mate, but she has no interest whatsoever. Because the Voyager is far from the Planet Vulcan, Ensign Vorik (Alexander Enberg) is undergoing the ""blood fever"", needing to find a way to undermine ""chemical imbalance"" in his biology which could kill him if he doesn't find a mate, battle someone for a mate, or meditate his way through the ordeal (which isn't easy on a starship instead of his homeworld). The Doctor attempts to appeal to Vorik to allow assistance in the fight against the blood fever, but this is a personal journey that resists the help of those not Vulcan. Vorik, not completely in control as normal, applies a telepathic link by cuffing his hands to Torres' neck, passing off the effects of Pon Farr to her. Beaming down with Tom and Neelix to a planet rich with an energy source certain to boost the warp core on the Voyager, Torres' Klingon mating desires inflame, encouraging her to act out of character, far more aggressive, animalistic, and ""hands-on"". When she bites Tom on the face (!), he communicates this to Janeway, learning from Tuvok that the blood fever is plaguing her as well. When Chakotay and Tuvok beam to the planet, they encounter an underground race whose civilization was obliterated in a fierce attack, leaving them paranoid, afraid, and far more alert towards any other invaders that might threaten them. But because the Federation is peaceful and wants to help the Sakarian race conceal themselves properly so no other visitors bother them, they in turn agree to provide the Voyager with the gallacite needed for advanced warp function. The episode develops the ongoing sexual tension between Paris and Torres by having them address buried interest/feelings that might actually exist but not act on due to the blood fever influence, introduces another Vulcan to the Voyager audience, recalls Original Star Trek with a throwback to the Vulcan mating rituals and Kali Fee (although there is a fight, it isn't to the death), gives the Doctor a challenge he nearly succeeds in a holodeck program recreating Vulcan and a mate for Vorik (and inspires a research project into studying mating rituals for other races), and prepares the Voyager and its audience for an upcoming foe, the Borg. It is a busy, very active episode, but a lot of fun with almost the entire cast involved in one way or another. Torres telling Paris be careful what he asks for (more of her Klingon side) is certainly a setup for future episodes (Paris proves quite noble when he resists his urges to make love to Torres, while she pretends to brush off their time alone on the planet as ""not her but the fever""). The Doctor's resistance from Tuvok and Vorik shows us that Vulcans consider their privacy of the utmost importance, not to be shared with those ""who wouldn't understand"". Losing their logic with the rush of intense emotion is embarrassing and frustrating to them. Seeing Vulcans vulnerable and unhinged provides insight into their ""bad biology"" where logic and control, key to their way of life and behavior daily, leave them; one moment has Paris sympathizing with Tuvok's biological ""imperfection"" every seven years, remarking he can't imagine what they must be like. To handle all these alternating subplots and keep the episode clear, concise, and held together is damned impressive work from Robinson.",8

Shortly thereafter, we had computers, 500 cable channels, the iPod, streaming media, Netflix -- you know the drill. What is especially remarkable is how weak the series started -- one reviewer called it an ""inter-stellar day care centre,"" a reference to the attempt at political correctness in the early episodes -- and how well it finished. Some of the individual time travel episodes are as good as, or better, than theatre features. This episode is testament to the talent of Roxanne Dixon, whose contribution to the series was not always appreciated by reviewers. (Though she did direct some episodes). Here she has to move back and forth between her usual character and one possessed by a ""chemical balance."" She is fantastic.

While B'Elanna, Tom and Neelix are on the away mission looking for ore it is clear that something is wrong with B'Elanna; she is being even more aggressive than usual. It turns out that when Vorik grabbed her he made a telepathic link and now she too us undergoing the Parn Far. She must return to the ship to be treated but it appears the mines weren't as abandoned as had been thought and the owners have the away team surrounded before they can leave. A fight ensues and Tom and B'Elanna are trapped behind a cave in. Here he must resist her advances while trying to find a way out.This was a fairly enjoyable episode, it was fun watching Tom resist B'Elanna's advances and the Doctor's solution to Vorik's problem seemed obvious at first but it led to a nice surprising ending. I'd noticed that Vorik had been appearing more lately, now it is clear why; the writers didn't want a crewmember we'd never seen before taking a major role. The costumes the away team wore for they away mission looked unfortunately like pyjamas; they certainly weren't flattering tor the male cast members. Roxann Dawson but in a good performance as B'Elanna and Alexander Enberg was equally good as Vorik; it was great seeing the two of them fight.

But it seems Vorik has already infected B'Elanna with the raging hormones because she starts going crazy on an away mission and begging Tom to sex her in the rough and dirty Klingon-style. I like Voyager because it's a family show.The episode gets extremely weird and difficult to watch as B'Elanna begs and pleads for sex... this is not only bizarre for Trek, it's bizarre for anything other than hardcore pornography. Up on the ship, Doc satisfies Vorik's epic erection by generating a Vulcan holodeck prostitute for him to screw. I know... if you thought that sentence was hard to read just imagine writing it.The Doc's plan seems to work- Vorik is cured- until we learn in one of the sloppiest jump cuts and story gaps in history that Vorik has singlehandedly sabotaged the ship's communications AND transporters AND has beamed down to the surface STILL crazy with the urges AND ready to fight to the death over B'Elanna.

Here in ""Unity"" Robert Duncan McNeill ('Paris' from ""Star Trek: Voyager"") directs. Such things were common with the Trek shows--with a variety of actors from the shows getting to direct episodes. Most notably, LeVar Burton (29 episodes) and Jonathan Frakes (from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""14 episodes as well as movies) directed a lot of shows throughout all the later incarnations of ""Star Trek"" and went on to direct a variety of non-Trek shows.At the end of the last episode, the Borg's presence in the Delta Quadrant is revealed with Chakotay discovers the corpse of a Borg drone. In ""Unity"", Chakotay and a 'red shirt' hear a distress call and when they respond, they find a planet peopled by their Swedish adversaries (yes, I know the Borg are NOT Swedish). However, it's a trap and you can guess what happens to the red shirt! Chakotay is rescued by a pretty lady and he learns that a bunch of Alpha Quadrant folks had been brought to this planet long ago. Oddly, it's peopled by all sorts of folks from all different races and planets. In the meantime, Captain Janeway and Voyager find a Borg ship that is apparently dead in space--and Torres says it's like a 'ghost ship'. What's next? See the episode.Through two and a half seasons, ""Star Trek: Voyager"" suffered because the ship's enemies were for the most part really uninteresting. Unlike Romulans or Klingons in previous series, the Kazon were not particularly interesting or scary. The closet to interesting villains were the Vidiians but they were never particularly developed in the show. Fortunately, someone must have realized this and from this episode on, the Borg would become a super-serious threat--and the episodes would improve as a result. So, because of this, I really appreciate ""Unity"". Well worth seeing.",8

As Chakotay gets more ill they link him to their local collective to cure him, afterwards they with to fully restore their collective in an attempt to stop the various races fighting each other as was happening at the time. Meanwhile Voyager has found a Borg Cube adrift in space.

It turns out he is still connected to them and they force him to reactivate the cube and even to fire upon his crewmates, perhaps they weren't to be trusted after all, or perhaps they were just desperate.This was a good episode and an interesting reintroduction to the Borg who had featured in other series of Star Trek but up until this point hadn't been seen alive in Voyager. I liked how we were never sure whether they could be trusted; even at the end it was ambiguous as to what they would do next. It is a pity Chakotay was accompanied by Kaplan rather than a regular character; Kaplan didn't really need to die but as soon as she appeared it was likely that she'd be killed as we'd never heard of her before this episode making her expendable as far as the series is concerned.",7

Nobody created better Borg episodes that Voyager.For the cynic who thinks Voyager often falls astray of trying to get home each and every episode, I'd like to remind everyone that Star Fleet also had it's supplementary goal to lean new things as opportunities arose hence the reason we commonly see many episodes drift off track. Life isn't just about the destination - it's about the journey. The scene where the attractive Borg intimates a different type of closeness is a real feeling and one not worth overlooking. As a metaphor, I'd call it like the moment we fell in love v/s the way we stay in love decades later and yet with such GREATER intimacy even though the physical expressions might not always be geared towards the typical procreation type activities. What the sub commander feels is like us old farts who're more in love than ever hence I REALLY like this story plot.Star Trek has always been about concepts & ideas.

Ensign Nobody is shot and killed within the first three seconds and Chakotay goes on to forge a relationship with the Borg lady who saved his life, resulting in a rare instance of sexual intimacy.This intimacy is a rare thing in Voyager (and Star Trek shows in general) but it isn't used nearly enough to give the episode any bite. The climax of the episode has Chakotay helping the former Borg via some combination of telepathy and mind control, but it would have been a lot more interesting if he considered betraying Voyager all on his own simply because of some mushy feelings for his new friend. What does make the episode interesting is the political questions raised about the limits of socialism within a democracy. The new Borg are living in a co-op, which is seen as a good thing so long as each of them are still free to make up their own minds about things. But the moment they have united their society into a single collective, the question is raised as to how they will use their new found ""power"". The episode features more than a few holes (see the Goofs section for most of them), but watch towards the end of the episode for Harry Kim's imitation of the Flash.

It had a rough start but found better footing as it evolved. The quality was uneven, ranging from just OK to brilliant. The time travel episodes in particular are as good a many features. Jennifer Lien, originally the femme fatale, was thrown under the bus for a newbie Borg character who, to be fair, made Lien look like a boy. And -- note this episode in particular -- the series included a strange photonic doctor played by an actor -- Picardo -- who in his career did not ordinarily ""do"" good guys, but managed to hold up his end nonetheless. And then here comes this gem. If you have ever seen Tracy in the original Jekyll and Hyde, then you know how tricky this transition is, how it takes the most subtle of mannerisms to convey the change. And Picardo pulls it off! The scene where he follows an attractive ensign into the turbo-lift is astonishing because nothing actually happens, but the sense of impending menace is almost tangible. Kudos to Picardo.

The budding restlessness within Kes doesn't shore up the plot, and Tuvok seems to be going through the motions while investigating the crimes being comitted on the planet's surface.
The episode would get a much lower personal rating from my perspective were it not for a few scattered moments of well-played suspense, mild as it is. That, and the idea of how deadly a crazy hologram could be are the saving graces. If the director had forced a more mysterious script, waiting until much later for the big reveal, the plot would have been more well received.

This makes for an interesting confrontation. Fortunately, in addition to this, the show has LOTS of innovative plot elements-- more than you'd usually expect on a Trek show--making it well worth seeing. My only complaint is near the end, Voyager is under attack and they beam Neelix and Tuvok aboard--but how can they do this with their shields up?!

Loken is stunning! This one-dimensional aspect just makes the whole episode get kind of boring. There is too much smooching and kissing.

I was thinking of an episode of ""Star Trek: The Animated Series""---a story called ""The Lorelei Signal"", which has a similar theme---and I suddenly realized how much the later Trek series has taken from the original! You may recall that the male members of the landing party were being drained of their energy and their life signs by the all-female inhabitants of the planet and how Lt. Uhura had to effect the rescue by beaming down an entire all-female security team to put a stop to the deleterious proceedings. I couldn't help smiling as I noted how similar the denouements of both episodes turned out---and I was also scratching my head in bewilderment over Harry Kim's propensity for getting into trouble.

Harry, being a wet sponge, declines, because the script tells him to, and we soon learn that these are evil women who only want his spunk for reproductive purposes.Wouldn't a planet full of women be better off going after EVERY male on Voyager and asking each one to fertilize multiple women? Wouldn't that leave them all pregnant with eventually enough children to continue their population? Of all the men on Voyager, why would these women bypass Tom and Chakotay in favor of shaved panda Harry Kim?Did the producers really plan on having Harry become an alien to provide him with personality and then chicken out during production?

5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Favorite Son (TV Episode 1997)",Is Harry an alien?,"As Voyager passes a star system Harry gets a sense of déjà vu, then when an alien ship greets them he claims it is about to attack and fires on it without authorisation. Afterwards he remains convinced that they were in imminent danger but can't say why. He later awakes from a nightmare and when he looks in a mirror he finds he has strange markings developing on his face. When more alien ships approach Voyager he gets the feeling a local planet will provide safety. As Voyager approaches a ship approaches but attacks the other vessels. When the aliens called the Taresians contact Voyager they claim that Harry is one of them; they breed by implanting their embryos into various aliens and the babies look like their parents but are drawn to explore space and find their way back to Taresia. When they beam down to the surface Harry is certainly made to feel welcome as a bevy of beauties virtually throw themselves at him. He learns that women there outnumber men by almost ten to one. All looks good for Harry but after Voyager goes to talk to the first aliens the crew find that they can't return to Taresia as a protective grid has been put up; it looks like somebody doesn't want them getting Harry back. On the surface the woman are making Harry feel very welcome and another recently returned man tells Harry how great life is there for a man; he is about to marry three women. Harry is keen to return to Voyager though and when he evades the female attention he makes a startling discovery concerning the fate of the Taresian men. On Voyager the Doctor has made his own discovery that suggests the Taresians have been less than honest.This was a decent episode where Harry got to take the leading role, while he isn't my favourite character Garrett Wang does well in the role bringing a nice sense of innocence to the character. The Taresians reminded me of the sort of aliens we'd get in the original series although as this was made in the nineties these had less revealing clothes than we'd have seen in the earlier series!",7
6,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Favorite Son (TV Episode 1997)",Misogyny in space,"A wildly offensive and misogynistic episode, ""Favorite Son"" opens with an intriguing premise: a alien species claims to have sent their offspring to other worlds where they gestate inside alien wombs Years later the children return to provide new genetic material into the alien culture. It's a Harry Kim episode this time out, so actor Garrett Wang gets to stretch his (limited) acting chops.Sadly, the society that Ensign Kim is sent into is so sexist that I'm amazed a show as ""progressive"" as Star Trek ever let this get produced. The Terisians are made up entirely of beautiful women and of course they turn out to be a society of maneaters - like the preying mantis, they kill the man after sex. They tempt Harry Kim with a single thing: sex. They offer the prospect of 3 wives and the women pretty much hang off him like a harem.Basically, this episode implies that the only way women can ever conquer men is through the use of sexual temptation - a terrible irony given Voyager is the show with the female captain who most often outwits her opponent and never has to resort to seducing them. What's so awful about this episode is that it's all so unnecessary and illogical: for one, the Terisians are presented to be so technologically advanced and powerful that they could kidnap all the men they needed. Since they attack Harry at the end, they clearly don't need the men to be willing participants in the mating ritual. Finally, if the Terisians really do need to create a society that is tempting to ALL visitors, they would need to have a much wider appeal then just giving men the possibility for a foursome. A alien from a polygmous species, for instance, wouldn't be tempted by something he could get a home. Logically, the Terisians would need to find other means of making their society so tempting At the end of the episode, Harry tells Neelix the story of Odysseus and how he lashed himself to the ship so he could hear the siren's songs. This is a mixed metaphor. Odysseus was not presented with a pre-pubescent fantasy by the siren's: he was presented with a song that cast a spell over him. If the Terisians had done this, ""Favorite Son"" would have been a much smarter and less offensive bit of TV.",1

It doesn't take long until he realizes that being snuggled with 24 hours a day would get to be a bit much. In the end, there is a solution (as there always is).

8,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Favorite Son (TV Episode 1997)",And there be spiders...,"And Voyager takes a nose dive again as the series fails to maintain its otherwise relentless mediocre course and plunges towards the atrocious in an episode that should have been named: and there be spiders..Harry Kim gets to be made the main star which is almost worst then making Neelix the main star. Boring vs Annoying. Oh, the choice.
Kim gets into danger as spiders in the shape of women lure him down to get eaten for his genes.
Do I care?
No.
Remind me what makes Kim stand out again?
He likes to play music?
And?
Well, he likes to play music.
Anything else?
No.. not really.Anyway.. some kind of race greets Voyager with powered down weapons and lowered shields, but they are arming their weapons in secret without Voyager knowing, except for Kim. Fire away he shouts. Nice that Voyager can or cannot detect this depending on what is needed for the moment. This level of bad writing, being super inconsistent, now even occurs in one episode. The bla bla buffers can detect a virus and cannot detect it. The computer cannot detect alien DNA and can detect it five minutes later. Oh, who cares.That alien DNA turns Kim into spider fodder in a desperate attempt to make him interesting. It fails. He is left behind on a planet on which 90 percent of the populace is women. Nubile women, so those women tell Kim. This means then that ten percent men, I assume, hasn't been devoured yet? Anyway these spi.. women tell him he is actually an alien of their kind who returns home. Except he is male.. And they will eat him. Well, they didn't tell him that. They told him: You're home Kim.. and strangely enough turning into an alien does give you spots, but does not make you interesting.
From that moment on every time someone talked about these women I mentally substituted women with spiders. And i didn't even knew they were going to eat him.. It was just obvious they would.In the mean time that species that got shot at by Voyager - thanks to Kim - is contacted by Voyager to ask them: why did intend to fire on us while pretending not to so we had to fire on you, so you could totally wreck Voyager when you finally did fire at us?
Cause we hate that other species!
Why?
Cause we do. And anyone having one of their species on board will be shot at. For no reason at all. Even if you would have superior firepower! Which Voyager never has, because the weapon systems are always the first to go offline in a battle.
For no reason you attack us but because you do not like those women. Because.. well why? Maybe to leave the viewer guessing?
So Voyager returns to the spider planet after having squandered the time on nothing. But this was just so they could find out that those spi.. women erected an impenetrable force-field around the whole planet to keep Kim in and Voyager out. Except that it is penetrable if you just plunge Voyager through some holes you made by modulating the shield or bi-polarize the emitters. Or inject a plasma stream into the warpcore. Oh man.. so many words that you can combine.
In the meantime a spi.. women ship is then on an intercept course so Janeway can shout: Battle Stations.
What does that mean anyway? Everyone is already behind the consoles they sit behind during the explosion scenes. Why shout this pointless line? Cause it sounds cool. Like shield down to whatever percent. Or establishing the cause of things after it has been revealed. We are being fired upon. Oh is that what cause the shaking of the ship and the lowering of the shield.Anyway Kim.. finds out the spi.. are women.. or was it the other way around? He flees..Comes in one of the most silly pole fights ever and show he has nothing to his credit but playing music.
The spi.. women start to prepare him but he gets saved.
Oh my, wow that was exciting. They saved him..
Who?
Kim?
The music player?
Yes, him.
Say,... whenever did we see him play music?Anyway Voyager flies off with the spidership hot on their tail when that other species makes in an appearance.. cause you know.. Script.
And while earlier into the episode that spider ship knocked out those other ships with one shot, now they can't. Cause script.At the end Kim tells about the Sirens... if you missed the reference.. we just grab your head and smash you in a full bowl of the painful obvious.Oh and he says: there was something exciting about having a new identity.Yeah,, maybe you make for a more interesting character being a meal for spiders.",2
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Before and After (TV Episode 1997)",This review comes to you ... FROM THE FUTURE!,"This review penned (keyed) in 2014. Over a decade and a half after this episode aired, an award-winning director would do a theatrical release entitled ABOUT TIME (also reviewed here) which essentially imparted the very same life-message (Carpe Diem) although with a slightly different story. I much prefer this approach, the notion of being forced to live one's life backwards, instead of having the ability to jump through time at will, simply by looking like you are about to have a bowel movement. In re-watching this episode (again from the far future, known in my time as 2014, we have mobile devices, there is ""an app for everything"" except it seems, common sense; and the politicians have all gone barking mad) I began to appreciate that this series, arguably the very last wide-audience Star Trek before channel stratification, seems to have produced some of the best time travel stories of the last 100 years. Good writers. Really good writers. If you are interested in re-watching this series, suggest you either purchase a time travel license (assuming you are reading this from the year 2183 or later) or, in the alternative, get the DVD set.",10
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Before and After (TV Episode 1997)",kaerF mutnauQ,"In a lot of ways, I agree with ""Quantum Freak"" but the things they cite that made it non-enjoyable for them, I enjoyed.But I will not refute what they have said, because they are correct in everything they said about not only this Ep, but the state of the show at this time, and the Main Producer of the show, one Brannon Braga.Voyager did not have the Braintrust which Next Generation had for the first 6 years, nor the Writing Team which turned Deep Space Nine into a full Universe-Spanning Epic.And it does seem that for the first 2 1/2 years, Voyager was lost not only in the Delta Quadrant, but in a mist of lagging and non progressive story lines.It was as if - As much as Janeway is loathe to avoid neglecting The Prime Directive, so too were the Writers of Voyager, being way too careful to avoid breaking the Prime Directive for the first two and a half seasons. Janeway's response to situations was inflexible and religious- Not at all Like Picard, who would not act UNTIL he had heard all of the options laid out on the table. But Janeway would never call for conferences of this sort, and she had only one rule, never BREAK the Prime Directive. This is a recipe for bland story lines and lack of progress.Usually, a show takes a full season of episodes (or less) just to establish itself. Why Voyager took two and a half, could be assigned a number of reasons: UPN was an Infant Network, and Voyager was a Network Show. This Infant Network (Now a Deceased Network) went from being ""Dramatically Different"" to being nothing but off colour ethnic comedy in One Season.Look at the shows which came and went: Legend, a Western Macgyver (With John Delancey)- Marker. Deadly Games. And the best - Nowhere Man. All GONE in the second year of UPN's existence, and all great shows, all replaced with lame comedies which themselves would not last a whole season Like ""Moesha"". It was as if Paramount was BET-Mount for a while. So every other Non Voyager show was a Race show. Now I love Martin Luther King Jr as much as anyone, as a human, but I'm for balance, not complete assimilation- Which is what happened to UPN.It was as if some universe-upheaval shook down the offices of UPN and did a Major Universe-Alteration from one season to the next. From the second year of UPN on, UPN only offered Ethnic Comedies, and Voyager. It was not that the Ethnic Comedies were Ethnic comedies, it's that they were BAD Comedies.So Voyager stood alone in this vast wasteland of television dren. Not only was Voyager a Trek show, it was Also a NETWORK show - It was no longer Syndicated. And due to this flaw, it could now be micromanaged - AND, Threatened with Cancellation.So while Next Generation and Deep Space Nine enjoyed a full seven years unhindered by Network Executives, Voyager was probably henpecked by these infestations from the start. Ergo, there was NO Straight Line Voyager took from Delta Quadrant to Alpha Quadrant.This is why I like this episode - It Established a FUTURE HISTORY. We know now, The Kremin and The Year of Hell is on the horizon, and soon.We also see microscopic changes in the timeline - Kes no longer has her Pixie haircut, she now has long flowing Tresses, and looks much better like that.Really, Kes was a good character, we only got to know her fleetingly. She was unceremoniously KICKED off the show, despite Strong performances- And she never worked again after Voyager instead actually becoming a real Doctor in real life.The best Kes episode was when she gets taken over by the Warlord, that was some range revealed there. Jennifer Lien was in fact the best Actress of the whole Voyager Cast, I felt a Method approach. Also, the character showed the most growth of all of the Voyager Crew, she was innocent, left the show with a streak of Darkness.So this episode, despite being weak in it's narrative, is in fact something that was used to put Voyager on more of a Straight Line to the Alpha Quadrant. And as we know now, the Year of Hell changed the WHOLE timeline- As well as Janeway's Haircut.Which was a bold move, but it had to be preceded by this episode, this one poorly written episode, written by tired writers. Oh, I agree with that 100.But if you look at the details of the episode, many of these details show up in the next 4 and a half seasons of Voyager, all the way to the end of the series. So this episode paves the way for the changes that made Voyager a much better show for the rest of the series. And, Season 3 is a look up, it is a good season, a season that ended strongly. But I still feel badly for Jennifer, she did not deserve to be treated that shabbily, and by Trek People, who are supposed to represent an ""Enlightened"" way of acting and treating others. The Prime Directive was Definitely BROKEN when it came to Jennifer Lien.",10
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Before and After (TV Episode 1997)",Living life backwards,"As this episode opens it is clear that something has changed; The Doctor has hair. In sickbay we see an unknown character discussing her mother's condition, then another unknown character refers to the patient as grandmother, it is only then that we learn that the patient is an elderly Kes. The Doctor treats her with something called the 'bio-temporal' chamber and she starts to jump back to previous moments in her life. She has no memories of her past but does recall things that have yet to happen to those around her. With each jump she learns more about her predicament but has to explain it to those around her again. It appears that sometime in the past, but in a time we have yet to see, Voyager went through something called 'The Year of Hell' where Janeway and B'Elanna died and everybody was exposed to Chroniton radiation, everybody was treated for it but it seems the bio-temporal bed reactivated it in Kes causing the backward time jumps. Luckily one of the jumps takes her to the time of the attack and she gets the data she needs; now she just has to get treated before she jumps too far back. As she goes back further and further in time she ultimately starts living her life from the start then jumps to the point the Doctor started to treat her when she was three. The events must have changed her in more ways than one as now she has long hair.This was an interesting episode that presaged events that we will see in later series; it is just a pity that Jennifer Lien was dropped from the cast soon after this episode meaning the events involving her won't happen as predicted. This can be justified within the story by Tuvok's comment that the future could be changed by the fact that Kes knows what is to come.",7
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Before and After (TV Episode 1997)",Almost Clever,"An episode that flirts with the being clever, ""Before and After"" suffers from the usual problem of Star Trek stories that involve trips to the future: if you change the show's mythology too much, you force the show to go into a certain direction. The dangers of this become apparent during Season 4 when Kes (Jennifer Lien) leaves the show, thus creating a paradox: the entire future she experienced is now impossible, rendering the entire episode rather moot.The reason this episode is ""almost"" clever is that in Season 4, the writers do return to the very events that Kes experiences (in the episodes ""Year of Hell Part 1 and 2"") Had the writers been able to stick to ALL the events that Kes experiences (Janeway's death, B'lanna's death, Kes and Tom's marriage etc) then ""Before and After"" would have been a rather revolutionary piece of television: an episode that told the audience everything that would happen in the next four seasons (they could have even brought back the same actors to play Kes' daughter and grandson). Whether or not this would have worked isn't the point; it would have been one hell of an experiment (and we can already see that these sort of Flash forwards have come into use in shows like Lost, Dollhouse and, well, Flash Forward).Sadly, this never happens. The episode ends with the usual bit about Kes experiencing ""a possible future"", thus freeing future seasons from any constraints. We are left, then, with an episode that is a slightly amusing stand-alone; telling a story backwards is always an engaging narrative device (see Harold Pinter's ""Betrayal"")and it's fun to see the Voyager crew engaging with each other in different ways. However, the episode does suffer from the fact that we as an audience figure out what's going on long before the characters do, and there's a bit of lag time while we wait for them to catch up.Of course, this episode opens up the usual question about inter species mating. For one, even if Tom and Kes could have a child, chances are the kid would be sterile (as is often the case when animals intermingle). And even if kids were possible, Tom's daughter is 1/2 Ocampa, which means her kid will be 1/4 Ocampa - which means the grandson would probably not be aging according to the Ocampa's usual life cycle and would not be nearly as old as he seems to be.",8
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Before and After (TV Episode 1997)",Unnecessary Tangent,"This episode is kind of whack because it comes from out of the blue. It seems so separate from the series, yet affects it so much. I fail to see the point of it. The future that they created in this episode OBVIOUSLY has nothing to do with where the series was going or in fact went. This appears to have been written by a writer who doesn't work for the show very often. The fact that the show runs for 7 seasons only further produces the plothole that if allowed to go to the end of the series in real time, Kess would be all but dead by then, and that would just be stupid. Ocampas (sp?) are a cool idea and everything but it's safe to say that since no Star Trek has run more than 7 seasons, that you could make her live to say 14 and that would be more believable. If you only live to 9 like most large breed dogs, you would be gray and wrinkly within 4-5 years ( 3 of which have already passed, plus, she was at least 1 when they found her so technically she is pushing 4 by the time this airs). There are more wigs in this episode than in a drag queen's dressing room. Seeing the Doctor with hair was fun. B'elanna had some pretty bad hair in the episode as well, but KESS? It looks like real hair but it flows like a wig in the wind... I fail to understand how we are supposed to believe that she time traveled all over the place and magically ended up where she started but now with long hair? Were the crew just sitting there and BAM! Kess has girl hair instead of boy hair? It's strange. I know the wig she wore before was kind of silly looking, but it was HER look. I would go so far to say that in NO Star Trek has anyone ever changed their looks so drastically in one episode, or even one season. Furthermore, because we have seen the end of the series and know this storyline to be a dead end, what is the point of the stupid episode? These are the kind of series changes that usually occur at the beginning of a new season, or perhaps in the middle where they take time off for the holidays, but at the end of season? It feels weird and ill timed. I actually thought I put in the wrong disc for a while, that I was watching a couple of seasons in the future or something.The actors must have had some time off because for the most part it feels like they are running lines as if reading the script or cue cards. They really let the facade down in this episode and for the first time you really feel like you are on the set, and that this is the footage that should have been cut. Poor acting, poor story, poor wardrobe, poor directing, and poor story continuity. That is what this episode brings to the Voyager table. Epic FAIL. This sucks too because I actually started to like the series for the first time in the season and now with the crazy changes already. This appears to be the least stable Star Trek from a story standpoint. Star Trek has a lot to learn from Babylon 5 which was written from beginning to end before the first second of film was shot. This ""problem of the week"" formula, although it worked for the original, is amateurish and leads to writers having to scramble and constantly patch plot holes. The continuity of the story as a whole entity is ruined by this manner of production. I really wished they had moved past that by the 4th run through.This probably marks the beginning of the end of a series often regarded as the least favorite Star Trek. So much potential wasted.",4
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Before and After (TV Episode 1997)",An Episode Obsessed With Hair,"This is a strange episode that explores some aspects of the Ocampan physiology and life cycle. The IMDb synopsis explains the basic story premise involving Kes moving backward in time at the end of her life, but it's one of those episodes where the viewer is dumped into the middle of things and explanations have to slowly unfold as to what led up to it. It's pointed out that Kes' future life, her husband, offspring, etc. is just one of many possible paths that may occur.A most disturbing aspect of this episode is the underlying obsession with not just Kes' hair, but the Doctor's hair as well. With absolutely no explanation, the Doctor has a full head of hair when Kes is ""old"". A while later when she's ""younger"" the Doctor's familiar male-pattern baldness has returned. Although Kes comments on this, it's brushed aside with no further discussion.Even more unfortunate are Kes' own hairstyles. A few episodes prior, she was lamenting, ""Why does everyone still treat me like a child? I'm three years old now!"". But when depicted at the elderly age of nine, Kes has the hair of a ninety year old woman. I realize Ocampans age rapidly, but does their sense of style necessarily have to become ""old fashioned"" too?The worst thing of all, is that at the end of this episode, Kes' attractive short, straight hairstyle has become inexplicably very long and curly; not at all becoming of her! And it STAYS that way in subsequent episodes!!! Very bizarre.",6
6,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Before and After (TV Episode 1997)",Great sci fi,"It's always been one of my criticisms of shows like Star Trek that they don't often enough set the scene for future episodes. Here, this episode makes a valiant attempt to predict one possible future, and mentions ""the year of hell"". You'd wonder if they'd got that story lined up already, and although there are notable discrepancies, nevertheless those events do transpire. It's certainly not a typical episode, and what a contrast from the horrible earlier episodes of this series - the 'Q' one being a stand out low point of Voyager. It's kind of a shame that Kes's hair style changes at the point she returns to its new style, rather than that being an event that follows in an episode or two.

The episode revolves around Kes moving forwards and backwards through her life on Voyager. This allows her to see into Voyager's future and she tells Janeway & Co. about a coming temporal war that nearly destroys the crew & ship. Janeway says they'll make a note of it. That's it.
Later in season 4, the two-part episode ""A Year in Hell"" covers this war. There's no mention of Kes' information and they make no indication that they even remember what they were told. They don't try to change or avoid the events and they just let everything happen to them, reacting & crying about their misfortune. I can't muster up one ounce of pity for the crew of Voyager, because I feel like they brought this all on themselves. WTH were these writers thinking?",4

While it had some very good shows, too often they were just junk---and I honestly think junk is the way to describe ""Before and After"". Now if you ONLY saw this one, it might not seem that bad...heck, it might even seem good. However, time and time and time again, this series obviously ran out of ideas and when this happened they did an episode involving 'temporal flux' or 'temporal shifts'. In other words, for some bull#@$% reason that they pull out of a hat at the end of the episode to explain it, folks go bouncing back and forth in time. It happened so much that it became a cliché--a very bad cliché.If anyone thinks that the MANY temporal shift episodes are good and would like to explain it to my, go ahead. But I contend that one or two would be fine....a dozen or so simply represents laziness and contempt for the fans.",2

I also realize that the average reviewer here is Comic Book Guy far from having a family. Or anything that might lead to being in the family way. I'm a father and the script worked for me.I didn't care that the eddy story was a non starter. Again Picardo's performance deserved some special recognition here. He chews the scenery with the best of them in the Darkling, but this was restrained and very moving.

After witnessing his family at a dinner B'Elanna offers to make a few changes to the program to make it more realistic. These changes come as a shock to the Doctor who doesn't know how to deal with a son who is hanging out with Klingons, a daughter who wants to play a sport he considers dangerous and a wife who has a life outside their house. As he attempts to deal with this family he learns that not all problems can be easily solved and some can't be solved at all. The secondary story line concerns the discovery of a strange anomaly in which Paris gets trapped while attempting to harvest particles which could be used for fuel.I quite liked this episode, the poignant ending of the Doctor's story is one of the more memorable Voyager stories; it was fun to see how his saccharine sweet family turns dysfunctional and after a tragic accident it is genuinely sad. The secondary story was fairly forgettable though and felt as if it was there just to fill time.",7

Ever. And it's not like this series hasn't brought up other family members for characters before and since, either; his family is, after all, just a holographic simulation which he can (and presumably does) switch off... which ultimately makes the episode, though good, pointless if it has nothing to affect future stories. The summary comes from the scene in ""Soul Man"" when C.

0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Distant Origin (TV Episode 1997)",Galileo in Space,"I'm going to go out on a limb and cite ""Distant Origins"" as one of the strongest episodes of the entire series. Although the central premise is a bit of a leap (dinosaurs evolved on a separate heretofore unknown continent, developed space faring technology and fled 65 million years ago), this remains a strong and compelling episode, mostly because of it parallels not only historical events but modern ones too.The strongest feature of this episode is the fact that the story is almost exclusively told from the alien's point of view; the Voyager crew are almost secondary to the story. The aliens, called Saurians, are determined to prove a connection between their race and the dinosaurs of Earth, an idea which flies in the face of his society's accepted doctrine. This event and the subsequent trial leads to numerous parallels with Martin Luther, Galileo, Darwin, Copernicus and even Einstien (who was called upon to defend relativity on numerous occasions).Although there's a bit of speechifying in this episode, it's almost always deserved and the only shame is that they didn't stretch this episode into a two-parter. There was enough potential drama here for a much longer story and it's a shame that the writers had to cram everything into a single show. Also, kudos must be given for being rather clever in the creation of the Saurian culture. Despite technological advancements (all designed with the Saurian's specific physical needs in mind) they are ultimately closed minded racists (they hate mammals and members of one tribe can only marry members of another specific tribe). Too often, races in Star Trek are either benevolent or evil: it's a pleasure to see one that has more shades of grey Finally, the episode also provides an interesting insight into Voyager's environmental footprint on the Delta Quadrant - aside from their technology, they're leaving a lot of themselves behind. This opens questions as to the long term implications of their journey and of space exploration in general (something we presently don't always consider as we venture to Mars and beyond)",9

That his race and that of the body parts they found have a common ancestry--so a reptilian species and a mammalian one are, in fact, cousins of sorts.To prove his theory, Gegen and his research assistant go in search of the ship from which this dead man originated. Soon they find Voyager and use their advanced cloaking technology to sneak aboard the ship. Unfortunately, the crew are able to detect their presence and soon an unexpected first contact occurs.Up until this discovery, you never seen or hear anything from the viewpoint of the Federation--it's all Voth.

Both episodes are first rate.In particular, the dialog and acting of the Voth scientist and his assistant were very well done. They radiate intelligence and scientific curiosity.The resolution was also well done with no Deus ex machina making a last minute appearance. Chakotay gives an impassioned plea for the triumph of reason over orthodoxy, but just like on our world, the powers that be could care less about truth. They care more about maintaining their power and the status quo.",10

This find suggests their belief that their species evolved elsewhere is correct and the orthodoxy that they evolved locally and are the oldest species in that area of space are inaccurate. As their views are considered heretical they try to find living people. A part of the remain's uniform leads them to seek and eventually find Voyager. They board Voyager thinking their cloaking technology will prevent them being seen but it doesn't work as well as planned and one of them is captured but the other escapes with Chakotay. Unfortunately this doesn't provide him with the proof he needs as those supporting the existing orthodoxies aren't concerned with the truth and threaten to destroy Voyager and along with it all evidence that their species is from Earth.I thought it was refreshing to see an episode from the point of view of an alien species although there were a few flaws such as how would an alien species be able to read the word ""Voyager"" on the dead officer's uniform and how would they know it was a ship's name? Apart from this the story was pretty good and the alien being forced to deny what he knew was true nicely mirrored Galileo being forced to deny that the sun was the centre of the solar system.",7
8,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Distant Origin (TV Episode 1997)",Chakotay as Scopes' Monkey!,"In one of the more clever and intriguing episodes of Voyager, ""Distant Origin"" pits a pure scientist against institutionally-enforced ignorance in a way that one can't help but compare to the present-day battle between evolutionists and creationists.As the episode begins, we are introduced to an alien paleontologist who discovers the skeletal remains and tattered uniform of the recently dead Ensign Hogan on the planet upon which the Kazon deserted the crew of Voyager in ""Basics"" at the end of Season two. Based on his analysis, the alien scientist determines that humans and his species -- that resembles highly evolved dinosaurs -- share some 47 common genetic base pairs in their DNA -- evidence that supports his theory that his species did not originate in the Delta Quadrant; but, instead, find their ancestral origins on Earth in the Alpha Quadrant.Unfortunately for our alien protagonist, his theory of evolution, if you will, stands in direct contravention to the prevailing ""doctrine"" of his people, who hold as sacred truth that their ancestors originated in the Delta Quadrant. As a result, he is charged with ""heresy against doctrine"", and threatened by the authorities of his people if he doesn't promptly recant his heretical assertions.Unlike today's religious right that consider Darwin's theory of natural selection heretical and lobby to have creationism taught in our schools as scientific fact under the absurd, fabricated ""science"" of ""intelligent design"", the closed-minded aliens of ""Distant Origin"" are the ones currently in power, and demonstrate a blithe willingness to extort silence from those who dare to suggest any contrary scientific theory, regardless of the strength of the evidence in support thereof. Ultimately, after a Delta Quadrant equivalent of the ""Scopes' Monkey trial"", the alien paleontologist of ""Distant Origin"" is forced to withdraw his theory, lest he end up exiled to a penal colony. To make matters worse, the authorities also threaten to exile the entire Voyager crew, as well, in a clear attempt to ""get rid of the evidence"" of this radical theory that would throw thousands of years of institutionalized ignorance into chaos, and loosen the authoritarian governing body's hold on the unsuspecting populace.If only the Clarence Darrow of the Delta Quadrant had shown up, things might have ended a little less bleak for our unfortunate hero!",9
9,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Distant Origin (TV Episode 1997)",Other theories of origin,"One thing that I found odd in this episode is the absolute absence of any theory other than the one put forth by Janeway and Chakotay when it comes to the Voth: that this race of 'sauropods' evolved to the point of super-advanced technology (warp capable) at a time when the rest of the earth was populated by amazon forests and dinosaurs. And NO humans. In this situation, the sauropods evolved and thrived to the point of joining the Space Age in a big way-- and yet never bothered to explore the rest of Earth. Instead they apparently stayed on their little now-lost continent, and, when they discovered that an asteroid was going to devastate the planet, they got on space ships and flew away.Two more likely theories (well, relatively speaking, that is) would be if either A) some race of space travelers 'rescued' the Voth species from doomed Earth and took them halfway across the galaxy. OR, option B) some debris from the collision of the asteroid and earth was thrown into space, and contained microscopic cells that later developed into life forms that eventually evolved into the Voth. But no, instead the theory is that a whole race evolved, learned, and thrived on one isolated continent, and,without ever exploring their own planet, they flew to the other side of the Milky Way.If this 'theory' had been tempered or at least mentioned as being only ONE possibility, this episode would have been much better.",

Spoiler ahead, this episode starts with the reptile scientists proclaiming the amount of joints in a hand would be a direct indicator that a species must be automatically very advanced in terms of technology. Let me stress that out again, technology, nothing about an evolutionary level as a lifeform. The episode keeps getting worse from that point on and is a perfect example why Voyager is definitely the worst Trek show in five shows. Another fine example of authors and scriptwriters not only debunking every premise and basic in the Trek universe, but also hitting the audience hard in their buttocks, unless they stopped attending school when they were twelve.

This should had been a 2 parts story in order to really develop the whole story, add a little to the plot and show the true potential of some dramatic scenes a little more.

The writers seem to know this as the logical things done in ""Basics"" are completely ignored here, as if the writers were afraid of being accused of copying themselves.The crew of Voyager is having a bad week - this episode presumably takes place within days of ""Distant Origin"" (the previous episode) where their ship was commented by a more intelligent species (we know this because Tom and B'lanna make reference to a bet they made in that episode). Now their ship has been commented for the third time in Season 3. By now, you would think the crew would have things down to a science. In Basics, the crew does the logical thing - they put someone in a shuttlecraft and send them to get help; this time, for some reason, they aren't nearly so clever. Since the Doctor has proved himself capable in Basics of sabotaging the ship, Chakotay should not have bothered taking him with him: it would have been much better to download him into the mobile emitter and send him into the ship to sabotage it. It's almost as if nobody remembers the last two times someone took over their ship.As previous reviewers have stated, this episode needed to be a two parter - everything happens just a little too quickly. Also, there's the usual Star Trek nonsense in which Janeway and Tuvok are able to not only decode an alien computer, but figure out how to master it within seconds. There's lots of other illogical things, but really this is Star Trek and often you just have to ignore it and enjoy the ride.If you take this episode out of context and judge it on it's own merits (rather than how it fits into the show's mythology)it's a pretty tense and exciting episode that also serves to drive the Tom / B'lanna romance a little further forward. Ultimately, it's a good ride, but you can't help but think that it belonged in Season 1 or 2, when the crew wasn't nearly so experienced in dealing with people trying to take over their ship.",8

It starts of with B'lanna, but by the end of the show, Tuvok and Paris have taken centre stage.To quote another reviewer, this episode does contain some of ""typical Voyager stupidity"" towards the end, but it's not as bad as it is in other shows and in any case, it leads to a lot of fun. This episode is reminiscent of ""Ship in a Bottle"" (from TNG) which must have been on the writer's brains (in that episode, the holographic Moriarty takes over the Holodeck.). Ship in a Bottle is a much smarter episode - I won't give it away, but let's just say that if Tuvok and Paris had seen it, they'd have saved themselves a lot of trouble.The only tragic thing of this episode is that we get a glimpse of how exciting Voyager could have been as a show. I remember when the show was launched, the producers spoke of how it would be a show where ""not everyone got along"" because it would be a crew of both Maquis and Starfleet personnel. This notion quickly vanished in Season One and the Voyager crew became a ""family"" just like all the other Star Trek crew. ""Worst Case Scenario"" reveals another path which the show could have taken which certainly would have made it unique.

From there, the episode seems like it's going to take another interesting turn in which Paris and Tuvok debate how to approach writing the rest of their holonovel. Thinly veiled, but it's always nice when the writers get to have a voice on the show of their own. So Tuvok opens up the re-write file and then...Voyager.So many interesting episodes up to this point on the show have been ruined by quick fixes, deus ex machina, or the Doctor completely fabricating science that never existed before just to end the episode. This one had so much potential until the insufferable Seska takes control of the holodeck and the whole ship.Wait, isn't she dead? Yep, for a year now. But hell hath no fury like a Cardassian woman posing as a Bajoran woman scorned, as Seska planned a little bit of revenge on her ex-boyfriend Chakotay and his new friends. Eventually.What was interesting prior to the ""stakes"" is that there were no stakes in this episode. Just fictional characters in a fictional setting having very real conversations about temptation, ship gossip, creative approaches and what equates to cabin fever.Disappointing, as the stakes aren't really stakes - you know Paris and Tuvok aren't going to die, so what's the point? We've seen this story literally hundreds of times on various Star Trek series, but so rarely have we seen our characters just being people for a whole episode. Maybe it's unfair to judge the show by 2013 standards instead of those of 1997, but it just hurts to see them get so close to something great before deciding to take the easy way out.Probably a 7/10, but bringing back the intolerable Seska long after her death knocks it down a point.",6

Because considering how easily Torres and Chakotay and the others just turn to being fanatic Starfleet supporters, it's almost too obvious that they use that as cover for their mutinousness.However, it becomes pretty obvious about the time Seska appears (if Neelix's casual betrayal of Janeway weren't obvious enough) that it's a holo-deck program. And everyone is apparently interested in it, as it's the best holo-novel program they've ever had. Given the sorts of stories we've seen thus far, that's truly believable, but hardly encouraging. Even despite the exciting premise of the holo-novel, it has little to no real excitement once the mutiny has been executed. There's little else that is engaging, and the characterization of Chakotay could only make sense if you assume Chakotay's zealous support of Janeway for the past three years has all been a ruse.Somehow, the episode keeps a solid 35 minutes of interest before I ended up glancing at the time, wondering when it would be over. In fact, it turns out Tuvok had written the program as a training program for junior security officers back when the Maquis first joined the fleet. Given how Tuvok basically tortured and assaulted the Maquis crew members before they suddenly become Starfleet-lovers some time before, this is purely understandable---beat the crap out of crew members who are different and never wanted to be crew members, then prepare your security team to murder them if their complaints turn to action.Then a twist occurs, as Seska programmed her holo-self to re-write the story at some point, triggered by nothing at all but plot device, and puts Tuvok and Tom Paris in real danger with the holodeck safeties turned off. The last 10 minutes resume typical Voyager stupidity, with the hackneyed idea of Torres and Janeway re-programing the program while it's running, and having Seska re-program their re-programming to foil them.It's exactly as stupid as it sounds, but it doesn't make the episode truly hideous. By Voyager standards, it's a huge leap forward in quality.",7

It seems she found Tuvok's mutiny-training program and- anticipating her eventual defection and death- re-wrote the program to include herself terrorizing the crew before actually killing them. Of course this is something we've all done at one point or another, and NOT a manipulative cheat by clueless producers.The episode, which started with an interesting premise, crumbles under the weight of the contrivances.

There were only a few of these. It was probably preempted due to those lame ""Syndex"" laws from the 90s, which prohibited local Cable providers from showing syndicated shows on two different stations at the same time. This was very stupid, thank you, as I was not able to view almost all of season four of Babylon 5 because of these dumb laws. And sometimes, although Voyager was officially a network show, it would occasionally succumb to the same stupidity.When this starts out, it appears to be a regular Voyager episode except that there are a few things different, that we don't notice right away. For one thing Lieutenant Torres only has one PIP making her an Ensign. And then when a call from engineering comes in, ""Its Jonas"", and we know he has been dead for a while. So, WT_?. They never show him, but this was actually the actor who played Jonas' real voice. Too bad they didn't have more of him in this episode.Of course Seska also appears and at this time she is still pretending to be a Bajoran member of the Maquis.The reason for the appearance of these characters becomes apparent, as the narrative is interrupted by a bumbling Tom Paris, who stumbles in at a most in opportune time.This is not actually a holodeck episode, this is a horror episode. It could have been much worse, it should have been much worse. It was plenty disturbing as it was. Of course when we think that it is actually a holo episode, there is that usual voyager humor in the character interactions arguing about who is going to finish this HoloNovel.It comes down to Tom Paris and Tuvoc, but they go from content creators to victims in one fell swoop.

Janeway was off the ship, things got even more confusing Seska appears... it turns out it does all make sense as it isn't real but a program B'Elanna had found in the ship's holosuite. She tells Paris about it and soon everybody on board seems to know about it, however nobody knows who wrote the story or why. After a meeting it becomes apparent that Tuvok created it, not for entertainment but as a training program made in the days shortly after the Maquis came aboard the Voyager when it wasn't certain that they could be trusted. As he realised they weren't about to mutiny he abandoned the program unfinished and forgot about it. When the crew get to the end they are disappointed that it didn't have a proper conclusion and many of them wish to write the ending, eventually Tukok and Paris re-enter the holosuite and try to update the program and discover that Seska had updated it years before in a way that would be very dangerous for anybody else trying to add to the program.The story was entertaining enough but I'm not keen on episodes set on the holosuite, especially ones where something goes wrong and the safety systems are shut down; this scenario has been used far too often in the various star Trek series. That said it was fun to see Seska again; she was a good villain.",6

The concept of a Cardassian undercover agent who is only out for herself is pretty neat and could have worked. But this character became overused and downright hateful to see after a while. Too often, Voyager crew members were in a position to kill her (and this is the only logical way to deal with her) but let her live JUST SO SHE COULD RETURN IN A FUTURE EPISODE. Then, in the first episode of season 3, she died...and fans rejoiced. However, here she is back again--yes, a dead person returns. This time she's a holo-program that manages to take over the ship and threatens to blow it up!! Talk about contrived. It's all sad, as up until then, the show wasn't bad at all. The idea of a program hidden within the computer that simulates a Maquis takeover is pretty interesting--especially when the program is discovered and crew find it exciting to play in it for laughs.

When Tuvok and Paris attempt to access the program all hell breaks loose. Apparently the odious Seska (please please let this be the last time she appears!!!!) found the program a month before she left Voyager and re-programmed it so when Tuvok accessed it her character would come back and kill him and whoever was with him. Utter balderdash that the holodeck character suddenly starts to re-write their future let alone be able to take over the real ship. Someone probably should have put in a few safeguards.The worst part is when Tuvok and Paris regain their guns and they simply point them at Seska and the mutineers.

If that wasn't bad enough it appears that there is another species there, a species that is capable of destroying the Borg cubes with little difficulty. Thoughts of an alliance with these creatures are short lived however when it emerges that they are extremely xenophobic and wish to exterminate all other life forms. This leads Janeway to think the unthinkable and propose an alliance with the Borg.This is one of the best Voyager stories featuring memorable enemies, a tense visit to a Borg cube and as the words ""to be continued"" appear on the screen one is left thinking they are in real danger, especially one of the crew who has become infected after contacting one of the creatures",9

0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The 37's (TV Episode 1995)",Whatever happened to Amelia Earhart?,"That some of the Star Trek universe shows contain implausible or shaky science doesn't bother me. Hey, it's all probably implausible. I liked the basic premise here - people are snatched by aliens in 1937 and eight are placed in a state of cryo-stasis on a planet far, far away - like in the Delta Quadrant. And way cool - one of those snatched is Amelia Earhart. I love it that over 70 years after her death (I'm assuming here she wasn't really snatched by aliens), she not only is remembered but featured in a popular television series. But in this story she was snatched, and Janeway tells her that the main theory on earth regarding her disappearance was that she was working for the U.S. government and was spying on the Japanese to which Earhart replies: ""no one was suppose to know that."" Hmmm. This is the stuff of myths. By great good luck those brought out of stasis are found on a planet inhabited by humans (descendants of those snatched in 1937) who founded a flourishing civilization after destroying the original alien body snatchers. All the crew who visit the great cities of this civilization agree that it is wonderful. The Voyager crew are told that they are welcome to leave Voyager and settle in the new land but none do nor do any of the 37s choose to go with Voyager. I have a hard time believing that virtually none of the crew wished to stay but that none of the 37s wished to leave made sense - their ""home"" of 400 years ago was long gone. While this was a good and especially interesting episode, it was too short to tidy up various strands in a logical way. For one thing, other than Earhart and her navigator, the other 37s are pretty much ignored. It would have been better as a two-parter.",7
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The 37's (TV Episode 1995)",A bit of a stretch,"I've just now started through this series again, having only previously watched it when it originally aired. Yes, we know this is science fiction (OK, barely), but I have to say at this point, it is the only episode so far that had me groaning OUT LOUD over and over AND OVER. I was glad when I could get to the next episode. Yes, every episode has a little bit of the suspension of belief, but I can only assume the writers checked their brains at the door when they came to work the morning this script was written. Let me go through the mind-bending list of complete bunk we are forced to swallow: First, the crew follows a trail of rust (in the vastness of space, no less!) to a 400 year-old Ford truck which they bring on board and manage to start on the FIRST TRY. 400 YEARS OLD!!!!! OK, I have truck from the 80's that doesn't even start that well. But that is nothing compared to the fact that they followed a TRAIL of rust and yet the truck has not a spot of rust on it! (But it DOES HAVE a huge layer of dust that must be magical pixie dust because it stuck to the paint for 400 years defying any urges to float away.) Then Janeway SMELLS the substance in the back of the truck and announces manure! As if any gaseous odor would survive that long in space, let alone the entire truck! It even has gas, oil, coolant and a charged battery!! On top of that, they tune the radio in the truck and discover an SOS signal coming through loud and clear. Turns out this signal is from a far away PLANET. Wow, the reception range on those old radios must have been INSANE!! GROAN!! I am shocked this ridiculousness made it on the air.There's more. From the start, it would make sense that the reason the truck and plane are still be in good shape would be due to some time-based plot line. But no, that never even comes up, they stick to the idea that the objects are actually 400 years old. (But it's as if the writers changed their mind while they were still shooting, so couldn't go back to change anything.) We find out that aliens brought people over in 1937 to this planet. Still no explanation of how the truck ended up in space but the plane was on the ground. Especially since the farmer and the pilot basically had the exact same story of how they were abducted. How stupid can you be?? You start the show ON A FREAKING STARSHIP and within minutes have an old Ford truck in your cargo bay and then don't explain it properly???? Wow, way to go! GROAN!Now we get to the part where suddenly the ship has to land on the planet. GROAN AGAIN! I've watched enough Star Trek to know that landing the Enterprise is hardly ever done. When it is, it's for some really cool purpose. Yet for some reason that doesn't actually exist, THIS episode is special and we HAVE TO LAND THE SHIP!! Can't take a shuttle, can't beam down. Some blah, blah interference/science mumbo jumbo. So, there must be something AMAZING to come if they go through that much trouble. Well..uh...actually...NOPE. NO reason, they must have just thought it would be cool to land the ship!! What a complete waste! GROAN! Once on the planet, we get to spend lots of screen time with a gun-waving navigator who wants to stuff Janeway and friends back into the cryo-chambers DESPITE the fact that he insists what she's saying isn't true. HELLO??? You're still not believing anything, while you're FREAKING STARING at glowing high-tech wizardry and that is your first instinct?? Not even walk around the corner to see what is around the bend? Aren't you a NAVIGATOR?? And a human, for that matter, because we know that humans are naturally curious, hence the PURPOSE OF STAR TREK EVEN GOING ON THE AIR!!!! GROAN! And now we are literally WAY PAST THE MIDDLE OF THE EPISODE before we even get to meet the 500,000 people on the planet, or actually just three, well, just two take off their masks, well, OK, just one actually talks, and it's the UGLY ONE. GROAN! Everyone RAVES how the cities are marvelous, how they remind them of home, etc. But do we get to GO SEE?? NOPE!! Just endless lines about how awesome it is and Janeway staring out the window of the ship wishing she could stay. Oh, well, I guess we just have to take the writers word on how awesome it is, because that is all we get. No CGI shots of some blinking lights off in the distance, no quick shot of a crew person in the streets of this city, NOTHING. I MEAN NOTHING AT ALL!!! But we still are supposed to believe it is AWESOME!! OK, writers, WHATEVER. GROAN!! Now the crew get to decide if they want to stay, and the 8 cryo-sleep-no-mores get to decide if they want to go. WELL, I guess the cities ACTUALLY ARE NOT THAT AWESOME because nobody on the crew wants to stick around. And the 8 SIMPLY DEFY ALL HUMAN LOGIC and decide to not jump onto one of most awesome star ships in the entire universe for the trip home, even after the pilot swoons over the possibility of flying Voyager. I can see the guy reading the captain's log when they get home: ""They met WHO? And they left her behind?????!!!!!"" LOTS MORE GROANING!!!!!!",1
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The 37's (TV Episode 1995)",Not bad but not really season opening material,"As this episode opens the crew of Voyager make a strange discovery; floating deep in space in the distant Delta Quadrant they find a 1936 pick-up truck. Even more surprisingly it starts on the first turn of the key and a fiddle with the radio finds an SOS signal which Voyager had not discovered as they don't monitor radio waves. The signal leads them to a nearby planet where atmospheric conditions mean that they can't beam down or use a shuttle so, for the first time in any episode of Star Trek we get to see a star ship land on a planet. Here they discover several humans who were abducted from Earth in 1937 and held in stasis. When they are revived they are understandably suspicious of Capt. Janeway's claim that they were thousands of light years from earth four centuries in the future. One of them pulls a gun on her and the other Star Fleet officers are disarmed surprisingly swiftly. In order to prove she is telling the truth Janeway leads them back to Voyager but on the way they are ambushed by people who turn out to be the descendants of other abductees. They explain that they have developed an advanced civilisation and invite Voyager's crew to join then, this leaves Janeway worried that so many people will opt to stay that she won't have a sufficient crew to operate the ship.This was a fairly light story for the opening episode of the series although I must admit it was impressive to see Voyager landing for the first time. With the exception of Amelia Earhart and her navigator none of the '37s contributed much to the story. It was a nice surprise when it emerged that the 'dangerous aliens' were in fact human. This wasn't a bad episode but I feel it would have been better suited to the middle of the season, season openers should be a bit more exciting.",7

There are humans inside and they're easily revived. Soon it becomes apparent that these folks were all kidnapped from Earth back in 1937. Huh?! To make matters more ridiculous, one of the revived ones is Amelia Earhart! Huh?!?! Soon the Voyager away team learns that there is a thriving civilization on the planet--one that welcomes them to come live there on their planet*. The Captain worries because perhaps most of the crew will make this choice and making taking the ship back to the Alpha Quadrant impossible. Okay.

4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The 37's (TV Episode 1995)",Mind Numbingly Vapid,"From the moment this episode starts, the plausibility of it is so stretched it nearly insults a Star Trek fan's intelligence, or anyone else for that matter. This episode was a season opener, designed to welcome back the Trek faithful, and to possibly integrate new viewers who might be curious. I'm surprised both didn't run as far away from this show as possible after viewing this monstrosity. And, for those that are ardent Trek fans dating back to The Original Series, it illustrates in someways how the later franchises drifted from what made TOS special, and the later attempts struggle with. They didn't understand the essence of TOS, as Shatner once said Roddenberry admitted ""I'm writing Greek morality plays""; these later franchises focused on bells and whistles, techno-babble, and convenient resolutions in the final moments that stretch credulity. TOS focused on soul, humanity, and character development. At least in it's best episodes. In it's worst ones, well, they were more like this one.Continuing their return voyage that hopefully one day lead them home, Voyager encounters unusual compounds detected within the spacial expanse of the Delta Quadrant, ferric oxide: rust. That's peculiar! And an examination of this anomaly leads to... A '36 Ford pickup! In space! In the Delta Quadrant! I was expecting ZZ Top to appear! Well, OK, now the viewer's interest is piqued. How can this be? Let's find out. It's brought aboard ship, and the crew examines, looking for clues. Conveniently, Tom Paris is an expert in such ancient vehicles, explaining to the crew (in great detail) what year, make, and model the vehicle is, and how everything about it works. Not only how it works, but THAT it works! That's right, a 400 year old Ford pickup floating 70,000 light years from it's origin in temperatures not all that warmer than 0º Kelvin miraculously fires up it's engines once Mr. Paris locates the keys! I guess they really didn't make them like they used to! Lt. Torres even notes some strange biomass in the bed of the vehicle, which Janeway surmises even without the use of a tricorder that it's manure. Yeah, well Capt., you certainly can smell that emanating from this episode.Tom also plays around with the vehicles archaic ""AM Radio"", and manages to pick up a heretofore undiscovered frequency modulation emanating from a nearby planet! Yeah! Wow! Whodathunkit?? 24th Century state-of-the-art scanning equipment that can detect trace amounts of ferric oxide at Warp Speeds seems to have missed a AM band distress call emanating from a nearby planet, but the radio on a '36 Ford floating in space for 400 years, THAT will detect it! Has your head exploded yet?? Inconveniently, the planet, upon inspection, will not allow for the usual Away Team beam down, in fact atmospheric conditions won't even allow a shuttlecraft to land. Nope. For this, we're going to have to break out the big guns and land Voyager! Yay! You know they must be hiding a complete lack of script development when they need to distract the viewer with some razzle-dazzle like this, seeing as no Federation starship has ever been shown to land on a planet before. And, as we discover later, for no real particular reason to the plot device other than ""gee, we just can't do it any other way. Enjoy!"" BTW, not to be too nitpicking, but when it does land, and our brave away team exits the craft with our faithful Voyager resting in the background, the perspective is off so much that it appears that they would be lucky to fix the entire number of the Away Team within it's structure, let alone the dozens and dozens of crew Voyager holds. Must be a little cramped in there. They could have made that a little more believable, but seeing as that doesn't seem to be the case from the outset of this episode, I guess I should understand.More anachronistic Earth vehicles are discovered, along with integrated alien technology. Instead of Janeway surmising this could be some kind of trap to lure the crew (I mean, after all, HOW THE HELL DOES A WORKING '36 FORD END UP IN THE DELTA QUADRANT!!) the investigation blithely continues until they discover a number of humans cryogenically frozen including Amelia Earhart!! What? No Bruce Lee? No Woody Allen (see Sleeper)? And, although Capt. Janeway apparently had no idea what a '36 Ford was, or what an SOS distress beacon is, she DOES, in fact, know virtually everything there is to know about Amelia Earhart. Well, that's probably why she's in command.Janeway's primary mission since the first episode of this series is to find a way home in less than 75 years. She seems more interested in solving what happened to Earhart than fulfilling her primary mission.I personally couldn't continue with this farce any longer. Not only am I not interested in how these anachronistic elements of Earth history ended up out here, I also don't see how this is going to further any character development, add to the story arc, or posit some poignant question about The Human Condition that will make one think ""hmmm"" It's just a childish exercise of playtime; ""oh, what's that? Let's land here! Amelia Earhart! Run diagnostic scans! Reroute power couplings! Maybe with a tri-phasic inversion to the deflector array! Torres is on it!"" Blah, blah, blah. The lines are stiff and forced, plot devices unbelievable and unoriginal,and I'm not really sure any of the actors are buying this premise of an episode either. They're mailing this one in; it's filler. And this is the Season Opener!If you care to subject yourself to any more of this vapid and confusing plot, enjoy the rest of the show.

That bacteria needs oxygen and water to proliferate; two molecules that would not remain in the necessary quantities in a vacuum to form rust. Never mind the air in tires, a charged battery, along with oil and gasoline in viable states. So, clearly, the pickup truck was ""placed"" where it was found shortly before ""Voyager"" discovers it.""Why"" is never explained.So what?The episode is more about the people (and personalities) discovered on the planet nearest where the pickup is found. It also gives the writers an excuse to explain what happened to missing Earthlings from history's past, as well as to ""test"" crew loyalty to both The Federation and to Janeway.Good Science Fiction, not only does not explain everything, it allows the reader/viewer to 'fill in the blanks' with their own imaginations.Not a bad episode overall.",8

After a dozen or so episodes I've seen time and time again how logic defies the writing in this show, and continuity is disregarded though the premise of the show demands it (their new and continuing mission is to get back home; done far better by Battle Star Galactica). It really bugs me how knowing they are stranded ALONE in an unknown part of space where no allies, and no standing treaties exist...they take NO precautions! I think this is just crappy writing (they make Janeway look so incompetent). This episode is an example of that. ***SPOILERS FOLLOW*** Why the heck is Chakotay left alone in a shuttle craft!!?

Here in Season 5 they're still making dumb tactical mistakes but you groan look past them and then get caught up by the stories.

It isn't a large ship, just a shuttle sized craft that is piloted by Kar, a child who wants to kill or be killed in battle as a right of passage that will earn him his name. When Chakotay defeats him them beams him out of his exploding shuttle Kar is not happy, not because he was defeated but because he wasn't allowed to die as his culture dictates a defeated warrior should be. It isn't long before the main Kazon ship arrives and Chakotay is shocked to learn that Kar is going to be killed as a lesson to other Kazon children. When an opportunity to escape occurs the two of them flee on Chakotay's shuttle they don't get far however and they end up being marooned on a moon which is covered in booby traps as the Kazon use it as a training ground. Voyager searches for Chakotay and traces him to the moon and the captain and Tuvok beam down. While there the Kazon turn up and it looks like there will be trouble until an intervention from Neelix leads to a temporary truce to find their people. As the rescue party approaches Chakotay comes up with a drastic solution to Kar's problem... although as it turns out Kar has an alternative solution.This was a fairly average episode although it did give us some more insight into Kazon culture and is notable for starring Aron Eisenberg, best known for playing Nog in Deep Space Nine, as Kar. Although only a small part of the episode the best scene was the one where Neelix told the Kazon why they were going to help them rather than attack.",7
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Initiations (TV Episode 1995)","Oh, those annoying Kazon....","In the last couple months, I have gone nuts with the ""Star Trek"" shows. I just finished re-watching ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" as well as ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" and now I am working on ""Star Trek: Voyager"". One huge difference I notice is that unlike the first two shows, ""Voyager"" does not have interesting or well written enemies other than the Vidiians in the early part of the show. Later, with the inclusion of the Borg, things improved immensely. But the Kazon just seem stupid--like Klingons...really, really, REALLY stupid ones at that. They are hyper-aggressive but never in an intelligent or calculating manner and they seem way too dumb to have ever built starships. And all they know how to do is fight and grumble--even when it makes absolutely no sense at all. Because of this, I was NOT in love with this Kazon episode.The show begins with Chakotay out on a runabout for no clear reason. He is supposedly there to do some American-Indian mumbo-jumbo and when the Kazon show up, for some inexplicable reason Voyager doesn't notice and Chakotay doesn't alert them. However, instead of just blowing him up, they send a child in another ship to blow up the runabout. But, Chakotay is sneaky in his tactics (possibly because he's NOT a child) and blows up the Kazon attacker's ship. But, being a Federation good guy, he beams his would-be killer onto the runabout. Instead of thanking him, the little guy grumbles and demands he be killed! Later, when Chakotay's runabout is captured by the Kazon mothership, the Kazon are NOT happy that Chakotay spared the boy and give Chakotay a knife---telling him to kill the boy. Not surprisingly, Chakotay won't and...well, you should probably just see the rest yourself.The only reason you might want to see this one is that Aron Eisenberg plays the boy, Kar. Eisenberg ALSO was playing Nog on ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" at this same time and it's interesting to see him playing a different sort of character--one far dumber and less sympathetic. Overall, this episode is a bit tiresome...as are the Kazon shows in general. The sooner the show focuses on more interesting enemies, the better.",3

Chikotay tries to be gentle (at the risk of his life from this little twerp). As is usually the communications devices on the ship shut down. I don't know. The whole flow of this thing and those ding dong aliens isn't much fun. They keep harping on ""that darned technology."" And, of course, Netflix (I mean Neelix) gets in the face of the Cason.

But apparently not their barbers. The episode focuses on Chakotay, ably performed by Robert Beltran, one of the more talented members of the cast. The episode begins to flush out the sensibilities of the Kazon, or attempts to, that which they seem to be. And we begin to see more development of Chakotay, who is one of the more intriguing characters of the series, thanks largely in part to Beltran's talented performance, and Chakotay's Native American spirituality. This is juxtaposed upon the alien beliefs he encounters and interacts with as a potential victim of their manhood rituals.This episode tries to examine the Kazon deeper thru the tribulations of one of their young warriors attempting to ""make a name for himself"" (a little heavy handed with THAT plot device!), but it's very difficult to see them as anything original, and simply a regurgitation of Klingons; a 2 dimensional shadow of sacred Klingon honor or the convoluted politics of deception they enjoy playing on themselves as well as other species. Once we've seen it flushed out to the level The Next Generation accomplished through the character of Worf and his development, Kazon culture just seems like a copy cat version, a cheap knock off. Yawn.Also making a guest appearance is Aron Eisenberg, who portrayed the often irritating young Ferengi Nog in Star Trek Deep Space Nine. ""Nog's"" annoying staccato delivery isn't as welcome to the Delta Quadrant. While some Trek fans may welcome his guest appearance, I personally found it difficult to see him rise above anything but the annoying Nog.Every drama needs conflict, and there's plenty of conflicting values and action, which does set the tone early in the episode, as well as some decent a shuttlecraft space battle sequences, but the pace of the episode starts to drag as they examine each other's culture's ""values"". Yeah, I get it. We're different. Only you're the same as the Klingons....Vasquez Rocks makes an appearance, which any true Trek fan does admittedly enjoy, if not simply for the amusement of seeing Star Trek's most famous ""alien landscape"".The ending brought an unexpected and a welcome twist, and after winding our way to it, left us with a mediocre and at some times entertaining episode, but not an awful one.",4

No sooner has he treated her and he is sent to the mess to help Neelix who is pinned down by a Kazon. During the struggle something odd happens, the Doctor gets injured; something which should not happen to a hologram. Back in sick bay a quick scan shows that he is not a hologram but a human doctor, in fact he is Dr. Zimmerman, the man who he thought designed him. Assuming the computer is malfunctioning the captain orders the deactivation of all holographic programs, this results in everybody except the Doctor vanishing. Soon afterwards Reg Barclay appears explaining that it is true that the Doctor is Dr. Zimmerman but he is not on Voyager, just a malfunctioning holodeck program and he is suffering from a condition which makes him believe he is the character he was playing. To prove this he resets the program to the moment he was first activated in the Delta Quadrant and says if he wishes to survive he must end the program by destroying Voyager. Just as he is about to do this Chakotay appears saying that he is a hologram but trapped within Voyager's malfunctioning holodeck and if he destroys the ship there is program will be lost; he must then choose who to believe.This was a pretty good episode where as soon as the viewer thinks he knows what is really going on new information is provided suggesting something else. Episodes centred on the Doctor tend to be good thanks to Robert Picardo's portrayal of the character. The only weakness of this episode the rather abrupt ending and the false ending where the Doctor believes he has got out of the program only to find that he is still trapped... he was right when he said that Kes had beautiful eyes though.",8
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Projections (TV Episode 1995)",I Really Liked It; Or Did I?,"While the concept of this episode is intriguing, the layers of reality when it comes to holographic technology were quite confusing. As a matter of fact, I assume that Kes walking away at the end, added another layer of confusion which we though had been solved. It was interesting to see Mr. Barclay (Broccoli from STNG) show up. I'm pleased to see the Doctor becoming more and more significant in this series.",8

As his primary function is to care for those crewmen, a crewless ship makes him, well, useless. For a brief moment the Doctor begins to contemplate the Human condition of Usefulness. But, soon, the Universe takes a turn for the good Doctor.Robert Picardo's adept acting skills bring pathos, humor, even his character learns compassion while he's a merely computer generation. In fact, he's pretty much the Voyager's version of Data, which lacks some originality, but he's the series link into examining ""Humanity"" with the most humane component of a crew, it's Doctor. We also get plenty of back story regarding The Doctor and his genesis, a one Dr. Zimmerman.As with most later franchise series' after The Original, there's a typical need for techno-babble which is about the only use for B'Lanna Torres' character here. Yawn. Conduits, power relays, phase inverters. That should be a Star Trek drinking game. Every time some worthless techno-babble gets throw around, one should have to take a drink! Be more enjoyable that way.Kazons appear again as the nemesis du jour, and the always entertaining Neelix, also ably acted by actor Ethan Phillips plays the foil keeping the mood light; a refreshing diversion from the techno-babble normally used to strengthen a Star Trek plot. The episode is directed by Next Generation star Johnathan ""Two Takes"" Frakes, who understands well the Star Trek universe, and keeps the pace lively as well as intriguing, divulging only enough information to push the plot forward and keep the action moving. His experience is evident at shaping an entertaining episode. There's some shifts, some feigns, and the viewer is often kept guessing what's REALLY going on here.Barclay makes a rather awkward, and inexplicable appearance, I guess as a vehicle to shoe-horn him into the script some way, and give Trek geeks something to get all giggily about. It's kind of a stretch, but fortunately the strength of the script thus far makes it merely a distraction than a detriment. Past the novelty of a Starfleet officer popping into a series set 70,000 light years away in a different quadrant, the story carries on well scripted and well acted.On par with some of the stronger TNG episodes, it exhibits however some of the faults of TNG as well, where the resolutions become dependent on a increasing level of techno-babble which is a little disappointing. I think they started to either have to stretch the ending to fill time, or just got stumped where to go with it. The climax feels a little weak compared to the strength of the rest of the episode.Still, so far the best of the 2nd Series, even though for some reason it was produced in the 1st Season, and held to the 2nd. They would have done well to air it earlier.",6

Well, we know that can't be right or else there wouldn't be much of a series left, so it's up to writer Brannon Braga to take us to the inevitable ""it was all a dream"" ending in a meaningful way.The first half is interesting enough, with increasingly bizarre twists moving the plot along nicely. Lt. Barclay's role may feel contrived, but it's still fun to see the interactions between two of the most socially awkward characters in the Trekverse. Unfortunately, the climactic scene in Engineering has too much technobabble and not enough suspense, while the ending is best summed up in one word: meh.The episode's redeeming quality is its setup of the Doctor's quest to be accepted as a sentient being, an increasingly important theme as the series progresses.

After three-thousand twists and turns I simply pinched myself to be sure I was real.

One thing I don't understand about the Doctor in this show-- he can do so many things that 'real' people can do (very conveniently, usually), but I don't know why he can't recognize other holograms when he sees them. I know, I know-- holograms aren't supposed to be easily identified as holograms. But you'd think that one hologram (who is basically made of nothing but light beams, after all) would be able to identify and recognize other ""light beam beings."" Similar to how family pets aren't fooled into thinking that the cat or dog on TV is real, it's not 'real' to them.Anyway, the Doctor exhibits talents and abilities that are convenient at the time, and yet very inconsistent throughout the course of the show--and illogical at times.

Yet, oddly, this is one of my least favorite characters-- mostly because the show is rather poorly written and the ending very unsatisfying.When the episode begins, the Doctor is activated and finds that no one is aboard the ship--or at least that is what the sensors tell him. Soon, he learns that there are three crew members on the ship as well as a Kazon soldier. It seems that two Kazon ships attacked and the crew left the stricken ship. But the Captain is injured and needs his help so Torres sends the Doc on a mission outside the medical lab. What follows is a show that is VERY confusing and again and again you find out that what you are seeing ISN'T true. How they inserted Barkley (from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"") didn't feel right. And, after I kept seeing that was I previously saw was not real, I found myself feeling a bit annoyed--as the show seemed to offer way too many of these curveballs. I was even more annoyed when the show ended--and you learned that NONE of this happened and a very contrived and unsatisfying reason is given for all this.

She tells Neelix that she wants a child and she wants him to be the father, he is unsure whether or not he is ready for such a responsibility however. Meanwhile Voyager is having a problem with the life form, it seems that they are attracted to the ship, this becomes a problem when a much larger creature arrives and appears to see Voyager as a rival and starts ramming it, they must think what to do before it does real damage.This was a decent episode, it was nice to see Kes take centre stage; Jennifer Lien in great in the role. It was fun watching her eating bugs and I must admit that I laughed out loud as she tucked into a bunch of flowers as Neelix was carrying her to sick bay.

Soon they learn the answer--Kes is entering elogium. In other words, she's hitting her fertility cycle. But unlike humans, this only occurs once and if she doesn't take this opportunity, it probably will not return. I say probably because she is way too young to be in elogium. Could these weird creatures dancing about outside the ship have anything to do with this?The episode is good and bad. Talking about sexuality and procreation makes sense, as the ship is expected to be in space for decades. But the whole giant space blob wanting to fight with Voyager over mating rites--this just seemed really goofy. Not a bad episode but a strange and slightly disappointing one.By the way, maybe I am just being overly sensitive but Neelix seems an awful lot like a controlling and abusive boyfriend in this and a few other episodes.

Offscreen, Kes decides not to have a child but- lest we think the previous forty minutes had justified itself by closing a door for two of our lead characters- the lovable girlwoman nullifies all that came before by proudly declaring this was a false alarm and she'll still have the opportunity to have a child in the future.

2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Non Sequitur (TV Episode 1995)",A Harry Kim episode - I wonder how that might go,"By this point in the series, it has become pretty clear that Garrett Wang is, let's say, not the best actor in the world. What's worse, his character, Harry Kim, is very insignificant, serving the role of saying things like ""attempting to compensate"", and ""I am detecting an anomaly"". So having an episode centred on him to aid his character development was certainly necessary, but at the same time, a hard task to accomplish. To make matters worse, the episode they came up with was ST generic plot #465,5 with Kim waking up in a different reality, having never been assigned to Voyager.Despite the generic, uninspired plot, the story did offer a few chances to at least shape a personality for Ensign Buttonpusher. But both the script and Wang's limited abilities proved insurmountabe obstacles: a couple of scenes with potential (e.g. where he asks his fiancee to pretend like she hasn't seen him in a long time) could at the hands of a finer actor be memorable, but a real life Vulcan can't make the most of them. Meanwhile, once what transpired is revealed (anomaly, aliens), Kim is faced with an obvious dilemma. Go back to his reality, or stay where he has a good life and is not lost in space? This should be a difficult question (to say the least), even more so since the alien Italian coffee shop owner (don't ask) tells him ""who knows, there is 99% chance of failure"". But no, with the help of Tom who he contacted for no other reason than to have a second regular cast member appear and who pretty much kills himself in a YOLO moment, everything works out and Kim returns to his fulfilling job and life, detecting anomalies in the Delta Quadrant - without an ounce of regret for abandoning the chance to return to, presumably, the love of his life (however much someone with the personality of Harry Kim can love). There should have, obviously, been a reason to force him to go back, against his desire, but the writers could simply not bother enough. I mean, have him go to the holodeck and listen to ""I left my heart in San Francisco"" or something, show you care about this poor, poor excuse of a character even a tiny bit.There are other great moments in the episode, which show a lot of thought went into it, like when the Admiral says the next meeting has to wait since he is leaving for the Cardassian border but then he appears again the next morning.

This makes no sense and throughout the show Harry tries to find out what's happening to him. The answer really doesn't make a lot of sense (after all, the folks who made this happen certainly could have done a lot more than just drop him in San Francisco).

As they are rolling around on the floor they find themselves summoned to see Captain Janeway and ordered to go on an away mission which needs Tom's flying skills and Neelix's knowledge of Delta Quadrant flora to help restock the ship's dwindling food supplies. When they crash land they find themselves trapped on a planet with a hostile environment. Seeking shelter they seal themselves in a cave where they find alien eggs. One of them hatches and they must take it back into the hostile atmosphere if it is to survive. Back on Voyager Kes is feeling bad that two people she cares about are fighting over her and as they are missing on the planet she might not see them again. The crew work to find a way to get in to a position where they may be able to beam the away team from but this isn't made easy when an alien ship turns up and opens fire on them.I was pleased that the story concerning Neelix's jealousy finally came to a head and appeared to be resolved. While Tom and Neelix were the main characters I think the best acting came from Jennifer Lien in the scene where Kes is talking to the Doctor about her concerns about Tom and Neelix. I liked how Tom and Neelix worked together to save the alien hatchling and ended up talking their problems over even if the alien didn't look very believable.,7

Paris whines to Kim about how unfair life is. When Kim and Paris go to the dining room they deliberately avoid sitting with Kes which hurts her feelings and off she goes. Neelix and Paris soon get into a food fight but this fight is broken off when they are summoned by the Captain. It seems they are near a planet that appears to have abundant food sources; however, they cannot use their transporters so Neelix and Paris (the person who knows the most about edible plants and the best pilot) are sent on a shuttle craft to investigate. Alas, things go wrong and one more Voyager shuttle craft bites the dust. The planet is covered by noxious vapors so Neelix and Paris take refuge in a cave and seal it off to keep the vapors out. They find a just hatched alien who soon has difficulties breathing. They realize that the noxious vapors are actually what the alien needs to breathe so out they go, thus saving the baby alien. When they return to the Voyager, Kes is both surprised and pleased to see Neelix and Paris joking and laughing and being best buddies.

Naturally, that means that the Captain will soon ask the two of them to go on a mission! The mission involves the pair going to a nasty planet to see if there is any food. Unfortunately, the mismatched pair are stuck there--and an alien ship attacks Voyager. What's next is pretty clever and cute-- and it makes the show worth seeing.

There's obvious animosity as Neelix wants Paris to leave his woman alone while Paris had admitted to Ensign Kim he was possibly in love with Kes. So ""Parturition"" absolves the arc's deflating portrayal of Neelix who wasn't the kind of character to react as he does because Kes has never behaved in any way to warrant his toxic personality decline. Tom is prone to desire women he could never attain, but this episode treats him wonderfully (I like Tom and consider him as this ""reclamation project"" Janeway believes is salvageable a compelling character), allowing him to prove to Neelix that he would respect him enough never to make a play for his woman. They become stranded on a planet that doesn't have edible life, just atmospheric content which gives both of them a nasty rash. Neelix and Tom do encounter a hatchling they respond to favorably and wish to see survive, looking for whatever they can to feed it and nourish it so that it lives and thrives. Will there be a parent coming to secure it, retrieving it for a safe and healthy upbringing? If the parent does eventually arrive, will Neelix and Paris escape the planet through a small transport window? While the Voyager awaits for the transport window to open, they must deal with a ship orbiting the planet as well. This is clearly an episode designed specifically to *heal* the story arc that seemed to *damage* Neelix, and if that is the case, job well done. Plus, it actually is quite beneficial to Paris, too.

For the first time in Star Trek history I get the feeling that the writers actually dislike their characters, and that stranding them in space for a lifetime was just the start of the real punishment.

Kim has been exiled to an alternate reality, Neelix has had his lungs stolen, and Chakotay has had his essence sucked out of him. These aren't characters... they're victims.What's never solved in this episode- which even the Captain confesses ""raises any number of unanswered questions""- is WHY this alien chooses to torture them, what he gets out of his pain and suffering and obvious sadistic tendencies. If he can cause hallucinations why not just appear disguised as a recognizable crew member and sabotage the ship? Maybe because this way we wouldn't get to see Janeway's long-lost husband appear and question her fidelity, or hear Tom's vindictive Father call him a failure... we certainly wouldn't get to see Bellana's nasty sexual affair with Chakotay or hear Kes screaming in madness as blisters on her skin erupt with puss and blood.This is a far cry from Tribble County, in which swashbuckling sci-fi characters inhabited a world built expressly for them and their high-minded, mind-blowing adventures.

Suspiria, as played by young Lindsay Ridgeway and voiced by Majel Barrett was suitably sinister.",9
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Cold Fire (TV Episode 1995)",Dear Mr. Fantasy...,"There's a tremendous difference between sci-fi and fantasy, and the later Trek series began to blur the distinction in episodes just like this. What exactly IS the Caretaker that sent Voyager halfway across the galaxy? A robot? A God? A ghost? An alien? In the pilot episode the Caretaker is a plot device but a forgivable one: the writers needed a way to strand in the ship in the Delta quadrant, and this vague space-station/robot/spirit fit the bill quite nicely. But now we're midway through the second season, and the appearance of the Caretaker's companion raises too many questions without answers. What is this? And why?Science-fiction uses technical and biological fact as a departure point, as a way to advance or re-invent the universe as a backdrop for a story. It provides genuine reactions to hypothetical situations, or vice versa. ""Trek"" has always been built around the inevitable progress of science: someday, the show postulates, we will be in space, seeking out life and exploring strange new worlds, and this is the way the way we hopefully will- or will not- react. Even the episodes with the most outlandish premises come complete with a fictional scientific explanation... sometimes you can feel the writers working overtime to rationalize a plot line, and that evidence of effort and extra exposition is not always a bad thing; it is in fact a hallmark of the genre.In Fantasy, however, nothing has to make any sense. A frog becomes a prince with a magic kiss, a wizard disguises himself as a lion, and happily ever after can be achieved with nothing more than purity of heart. In summary: Star Trek = Sci-Fi, Star Wars = Fantasy So it was strange- if not inevitable- that beginning with Sisko's mystical destiny on ""Deep Space Nine"" that ""Star Trek"" as a franchise became more and more willing to slip into the fantastic, to embrace a sense of magic and the menacing mystery of Evil. The Caretaker is the perfect example of Star Trek outgrowing its sci-fi roots... is this a villain that can be defeated by a creative technical stunt or by pulling the sword from the stone?The characters- all scientists at heart- lose a significant amount of power when they're forced to fight a demon. And what's worse than that is this episode marks Kes' descent into futility. She's almost Neelix's wife, almost an alien, almost a sexpot, almost a nurse, but mostly she's a series of ideas that have thus far not coalesced into any solid character. Here, her telepathy- slyly set up in a previous episode- is brought to the forefront as her Ocampa kin encourage her to reach out with her feelings and face Vader alone. Whoops! Voyager can't keep it straight so why should I? Kes embraces the Force and learns how to move a cup, heat her own tea, and- for your nightmarish Voyager moment of the week- boil Tuvok's blood, disfiguring his face and turning him temporarily into a feverish monster.The Caretaker's mate Suspiria wants to destroy Voyager and assumes the form of a little girl for maximum shock value in order to taunt Janeway and horrify the audience. After Suspiria is defeated we return to normal- Kes even loses her telepathic abilities until such time that the script requires them again.A decent episode, and hopefully the slide from sci-fi to fantasy will be corrected as the series continues. For whatever reason during the conference scene Neelix refers to Kes as ""Tess."" Trust me. I played it back three times.GRADE: B",

Later, however, she shows she has super-powers--something that make her a very interesting character!When the show begins, Voyager discovers that the Caretaker who brought their ship all the way to the Delta Quadrant in the first episode might just have a mate nearby. And, like the Caretaker, there is a race of Ocampa living on a station and being protected by her. However, this other caretaker isn't so positively disposed towards Voyager nor are her Ocampa. Well, that is until the Ocampa see that Kes is one of them and serving aboard a Federation ship. What follows is a weird little case where the Ocampa teach her how to unlock her mighty powers--and then regret this in hindsight.All in all, a rather interesting and intense show--one that gives you some insight into the sort of being Kes might become in later shows. Very interesting and worth seeing.",7

The space station's head Ocampa, Tanis, comes aboard the Voyager and teaches Kes how to further and greatly increase her ""powers of the mind."" The kicker is that the female Caretaker blames the Voyager for the death of her mate and wants to destroy the Voyager but doesn't because Janeway shows her mercy. Right. At the end Kes tells Tuvok how much she hated liking the destruction she did with her new found powers, e.g., she killed all her plants. Tuvok tells her that there is no light without darkness. Oh wow, that's deep. And pretentious horse hockey. The whole episode makes no sense which would be okay if it were at least engaging and/or a bit humorous. Not this one. Nada. With this episode I'm getting an inkling as to why I stopped watching this series (in the fourth year or so) - it loved the dark and hated the light. And started taking itself way too seriously.",3

By the time Voyager turns up to mount a rescue mission the Kazon ship has been joined by several others from different sects.This was a decent episode with some nice action scenes. It was good to see Seska again as she makes a good villain; her final message to Chakotay showed how villainous she can be. Unfortunately the Kazon were never great Star Trek villains like the Klingons, Romulans, Borg and Dominion, they manage to be an irritation to Voyager but rarely seem like a real threat.",7
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Maneuvers (TV Episode 1995)",You're Gonna Be A Daddy!,"An exciting, intelligent, engaging episode of Voyager: the best of the best, ruined by a single, final line of dialogue that redefines stupidity.A Federation beacon turns out to be bait for a skillful robbery: a Kazon shuttle enters the ship, the invaders stealing a transporter module and beaming back to their own ship. It turns out traitor-at-large and absolute whore Seska has been feeding Starfleet secrets to her new Kazon buddies, allowing them access to technical information on a starship's inner workings.After pulling off this immaculate appropriation she taunts her former lover and victim Chakotay on the view screen, in front of his bridge crew, with words akin to: Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, you can't catch me...Chakotay and Co. decide to do just that, fully aware that Seska will be anticipating their arrival and attempting to take Voyager for its technology, which will empower the inferior Kazon-Nistrim, giving them firepower against their enemies and political sway over rival Kazon sects. Chakotay confides to B'Elanna that he feels personally responsible for this attack; Seska has broken his heart, betrayed his beliefs, attacked his ship and crew and is personally humiliating him in the process. The storyline here is so good that hideous trashbag Martha Hackett is actually rendered tolerable.Next thing you know Chakotay has stolen a shuttlecraft from Voyager and taken off without permission. The scene in which B'Elanna makes a personal plea on his behalf to Captain Kate is wonderful, an example of what works in the show and keeps me watching. Roxanne Biggs-Dawson has an energy, an urgency, that is impossible to deny and absolutely perfect for the character of Torres. Kate Mulgrews angular features and strong jaw, the husky growl of her voice play well against the softness of her eyes, the emotion at work within. She never has to shout or act like a man in order to convince us she's a starship Captain. Sexy and strong, sweet and razor sharp, she is a joy to watch at work.And the scene works perfectly: two strong woman fighting for what they believe in, the inner-disciplinarian in Torres' wild-woman persona emerging ever so slightly as Janeway tries to conceal not just her rage at Chakotay for breaking the rules but her sense of genuine betrayal and hurt at his actions, especially in this lonely universe of the stranded spacecraft. Nicely done, ladies...Janeway considers her options as Tuvok's logic and Torres' emotion perch on her shoulder and debate the next move. Seska confides in prisoner Chakotay's ear that she's not a monster and wants to avoid the death of the Voyager crew if possible, and this little admission keeps the character from flying off into the realm of cartoon super-villain, and makes her more realistic, and even sympathetic.The Voyager crew decides a transwarp beaming is the best method to recover their captive Commander, and although they eventually have to reverse their plan of attack they succeed in recovering Chakotay and destroying all stolen Starfleet technology taken by the Kazon. Janeway has a realistic discipline discussion with Chakotay, even wondering aloud whether formal punishment has any value in their situation.Just as we're ready for a bridge laugh and exterior shot we see Seska on the view screen, speaking the sentence that destroys this episode. Seems she took advantage of Chakotay while he was captive on the Kazon ship, sampling his DNA while he was unconscious and impregnating herself. Yep, the bitch is gonna be a Mom, and the last-minute twist that Chakotay will be a Father to a woman he considers his mortal enemy raises so many questions and makes resolution impossible.Is this Star Trek or Days Of Our Lives? What are we- and Chakotay- supposed to do between now and the inevitable follow-up episode? How can there be any satisfactory resolution to such an impossibly-muddied storyline, and why in God's name would the writers commit to bringing the dreadful Seska back for a mind-blowing FOURTH appearance on the show?Producers, do me a favor. Don't do soap operas. Don't do fantasies. Don't do multi-episode story arcs. Don't do ""To Be Continued..."" Don't do Seska. Don't reinvent the warp drive. Just do Trek, and do it well.

During the ensuing mêlée, the Kazon steal one of the ship's transporters. Well, this fight went too well for the Kazon and someone had to have helped them plan this attack--and that someone must be the traitor Seska. The plan is to track her and her Kazon allies down and recover the transporter, as this Federation device could throw off the balance in this quadrant. However, instead of working as a team, Chakotay gets all macho and defies orders--going off on his own to recover the device. This is stupid but what is worse is that he succeeds in destroying the transporter--and then, inexplicably, surrenders to Seska. Why didn't he shoot her in the face? He clearly could have easily done that--and she IS trying to give the Kazon technology regardless of the consequences. What follows is a typical Voyager plot--one where miraculously everything works out just fine.The bottom line is that the plot was generally good but often made little sense.

Chakotay, humiliated and feeling guilt due to Seska's ability to steal tech from the Voyager, takes it upon himself to commandeer a shuttlecraft without Janeway's knowledge, heading to the Kazon ship Seska is located, with plans to destroy the transport device before it can be of future benefit in the wrong hands. Janeway is put in a difficult position in that she must decide if a rescue mission can be carried out without jeopardizing her ship and crew, and figure out the proper punishment due to the ramifications of his negligence in disrespecting the protocols representing command. Martha Hackett makes a grand villainous return, having such revelry in her detrimental actions against former lover Chakotay and the possible dangers to Voyager, as her Seska uses Cullah as a means to a hopeful endattaining power how she can by orchestrating what she hopes is a unification of forces, if the various Kazon sects can agree to join together, attack the Voyager as a fleet of ships, and take the Federation technology certain to provide great benefit to them if victorious. Chakotay's efforts, though, foil such lofty goals, and the Voyager isn't about to just give up without a fight (and a creative transport rescue of their first officer). Chakotay gets pummeled but won't adhere to torture and give up Federation secrets, while Seska torments him with flagrant attempts to seduce him and further manipulate him. The way Seska works Cullah and mocks Chakotay and the Voyager crew gives Hackett a real nasty bitch to hissit's a great part. Anthony De Longis, as Cullah, has the perfect egomaniac with which Seska could caress his narcissism, making him feel he's in control when in fact she's totally behind all the success that eventually derails because they are up against a foe far wiser and slippery. Seska's devious methods (taking Chakotay's DNA to impregnate herself) beyond the failed Kazon unification show quite an adversary the Voyager is up against. The Kazon sects, all at each others throats, waiting to betray one another when the time presents itself, prove to be quite the menacing bunch. The Kazon shuttle crashed into the cargo bay is a nifty set piece. Janeway's scolding of Tuvok due to Chakotay's ability to take a shuttlecraft without anyone knowing conveys the demands of officers to stay on top of things, and the pressures put on a Captain when they fail to prevent complications needing closure with potential danger as a result.",6

2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Resistance (TV Episode 1995)",Decent but overly sentimental at times.,"In this episode of ""Star Trek: Voyager"", Joel Grey plays a crazy old guy who mistakes Janeway for his lost daughter. It all begins with a misguided covert mission on some crappy planet ruled by the Mokra- -some paranoid nasties. I say that the mission is misguided because the away team consists of a black Vulcan, a half-Klingon, the Captain and Neelix! Traveling in cognito certainly is NOT their style and it's no surprise that Mokra soldiers descend upon them. Tuvok and Torres are captured---Neelix escapes back to the ship and Janeway is rescued by Caylem (Grey). For much of the show, Chakotay is back on the ship trying to negotiate with the local authorities. Oddly, the boss-man on the planet seems nice and accommodating--and Neelix is sure it's a trap, as the Mokra are big dumb jerk-faces. Eventually, Neelix's optimism is shown to be sound and the Mokra start taking shots at Voyager. Fortunately, Harry Kim pulls a solution out of his butt (this sort of miraculous way out happens an awful lot on this show).In the meantime, the Captain finds some local resistance folk and they sneak into the prison surprisingly easily in order to rescue her two crew members. Then there's a showdown and Caylem bites it.This isn't a bad episode. While it also isn't good, so many bad episodes were made during season two that a mediocre one like this is a bright spot! On the positive side, the Mokra are interesting enemies and it's nice to see Mr. Grey, as he's a fine actor. On the negative, Kim's solution is very contrived as is the rescue at the prison.",6

Tellerium, a crucial energy source needed to power major systems on the ship (the warp nacelles will lose total power and the crew had pulled from other energy sources on the ship in order to dedicate towards the warp core, including life support and eventually the shields), is secured by Neelix who has contacts on the surface willing to trade with him. But there are spies among the Alsaurian citizenry, which could explain how Janeway is hit with a phaser beam across the neck, while Tuvok and Torres are taken prisoner and possibly face torture in order to provide names of allies to Augris. Caylem takes Janeway to his little home, helps her to recuperate, and speaks to her as if she were his daughter, his memory slipping and delusional state (this all stems from losing his daughter and wife, unable to accept their loss) unyielding. Caylem becomes crucial in Janeway's rescue mission and she will be deeply touched by his devotion and love for those he's lost and can't let go. His sacrifice and her final moment with him, telling him she's his daughter so he can go in peace is quite emotionally potent and poignant. The action plot is rather cliché, but I did like a brief scene where Torres talks with a wounded/beaten Tuvok about the Vulcan way of dealing with punishment and pain. There's never a doubt that Janeway will find a way to save them, and the episode even includes her posing as a prostitute in order to trick Mokra guards. The teleplay is loosely based on a story written by Star Trek fans inspired by Don Quixote (!), with Caylem representing the famous literary character and Janeway his companion. Grey's dedication to the character makes Caylem all the more worthwhile. The dilemma on the Voyager, regarding transporting the officers on the planet, as Chakotay must deal with Augris' retaliatory fire because of a distrust that is commonplace within the behavior of the Mokra, is not as pronounced and important as Janeway's time with Caylem. This episode proves that there are consequences in being so far away from the Federation in uncharted galaxy.",6

4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Prototype (TV Episode 1996)","Intriguing idea, not fully exploited","Star Trek as a whole has dealt surprisingly little with AI (even Data was most of the time a substitute Vulcan), perhaps because the franchise's Prime Directive has always been to speak mostly of contemporary issues in thinly veiled Sci-fi metaphors.So it is good to see Voyager tackle a more classical sci-fi issue, when the crew recovers and revives a damaged android. Torres manages to repair and upgrade it, which leads to the robot requesting her help in solving its people problem: they cannot build more of themselves. The Captain forbids it, as it would constitute a violation of the prime directive. Now, to be honest, I am at times buffled - I thought the directive was specifically meant for species that have not achieved warp technology, otherwise any interference with any species that is not already in the Federation would be forbidden? I don't know. Anyway, in Voyager's case we can say that being lost in the D Quadrant the consequences of intervention are greater and leave it at that.Of course, the robot disagrees with the Captain's decision, and makes the logical choice to kidnap the potential saviour, leading to a standoff.
The rest of the episode plot wise is pretty generic, with a mumbo jumbo way of eventually rescuing Torres from the robot ship thanks to a convenient attack by another vessel, but the essence is elsewhere. Namely, in the machines' dark background, as it is revealed that they killed their makers when they realised their usefulness would soon be over, and in Torres' pained decision to terminate her creation. There is a bit of Frankenstein's pride and audacity there, as she recalls how it was alive.Exactly because of the interesting dilemmas and ideas, I think this is exactly the story that needed a resolution not based on ""gap in the shields, rescue attempt, beam us out"", but on dialogue. I am not sure how that would happen, but the robots' background could use more detail.PS: the androids here look like they came from a 1950's film.

He reasons that the theoretical ideals of Starfleet don't apply out here. Janeway considers his proposal, and in a very good scene she turns to Tuvok for help in understanding the philosophy. If they don't have Starfleet's values what do they have?A sloppy effort is made to form an alliance with two different Kazon factions, one by sending Neelix as a messenger, the other by contacting the lovable Seska. What makes me think this isn't gonna work out? The worse problem facing Voyager seems to be not the Kazon but the increasing number of crewmen questioning the Captain's authority, openly disagreeing with her or even turning into treacherous, traitorous Kazon spies as in the case of Michael Jonas. (Way to monitor outgoing communications, Security Chief Tuvok.)What follows is a musical chairs of political alliance, in which the Captain rejects Seska's Nistrim, gets rejected by the Pommar, and develops a surprise alliance with the Trabes, the former enslavers of the Kazon and their current sworn enemy. Mabus, their leader, urges Janeway to gather the heads of the five Kazon families for a peace talk, a chance to bring stability to the region and end all the conflict. Neelix tips her off that an assassination might be planned for this conference, and in spite of the overwhelming potential for disaster Janeway decides to proceed with the meeting.This was a false note for me here from which the episode could not recover. First and foremost, according to Voyager's premise, the ship is passing through the Delta Quadrant on its way home. The idea that they could get pulled into repeated conflicts with the same civil war-torn culture is unlikely. The idea that their meetings with the Kazon could be so consistently bloody and destructive to a Federation WARSHIP that boasts superior technology is illogical. And the premise of Janeway going from a Prime Directive-based non-involvement policy to happily joining whichever warring faction will have her is unbelievable. Her failure to see the potential for an assassination is a writing cheat; Janeway is neither blind nor stupid.All she has managed to do so far is unite the Kazon in a joint hatred of herself and her ship. That should make the journey home go much more smoothly! We're left with a re-affirmation of Starfleet's high-minded principles, and a greater appreciation for the cultures that sacrificed to establish them. Janeway gives a pointed speech to her senior officers that seems at first arrogant, but soon reveals itself as absolutely true, and with further reflection, already tragic. The Starfleet ideals may be their best weapon, but their best weapon might not be enough... and unbeknownst to Janeway is the traitor: those noble ideals she subscribes to are already decaying from the inside.Kes is reduced to a tricorder stand... you can feel the writers pushing her aside. It will be interesting to see how the traitor storyline plays itself out. A very good episode. GRADE: A-",9
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Alliances (TV Episode 1996)",Ones enemy's enemy is not always ones friend,"After the latest Kazon attack which left one crew member dead and several wounded the crew are starting to question the wisdom of the captain's insistence that they don't deal with the Kazon. Chakotay talks to her and persuades her that they must do something. She agrees to having discussions with the Kazon but says that this will not involve giving any technology. While Voyager heads off to talk to Seska and the Kazon Nistrim Neelix goes off to talk to one of the smaller sects. His talks do not go well and he finds himself in custody alongside a group of people called the Trabe. We learns that these people used to be the dominant race in the sector and that they used to subjugate the Kazon until they rebelled and forced the Trabe to abandon their home world and head into space. They manage to escape and meet up with Voyager which had had no luck either. The Trabe suggest that they form an alliance and call a meeting between Voyager, the Trabe and the leaders of the various Kazon sects to negotiate safe passage. During the meeting Janeway realises something is very wrong and they beam out just before a Trabe ship attacks. With the Trabe proved to be dishonest the new alliance is very short lived and Voyager is once again on its own in an even more dangerous position than before.This episode had some impressive action scenes one of which includes a rare character death. I liked how the Trabe who had apparently learnt their lesson concerning their treatment of the Kazon turned to be as bad as they used to be although it might have been even better if the alliance had lasted a couple more episodes before they were exposed.",8

She lectures her crew like an old lady English teacher (I am an English teacher, so don't get your hackles up). The crew wants to try something new, a bit of negotiation instead of a violent solution. So what happens when they try? The forces at work are shown to be untrustworthy, so give up any hope of doing something other than force. Still, it was very interesting and really a bit accurate.",8
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Alliances (TV Episode 1996)",Good episode ruined by the ending!,"Up until the very end of this episode, I would have probably scored this one a 7 or possibly an 8. However, the writer just couldn't leave well enough alone and the very end is a preachy and embarrassing mess.When the episode begins, Voyager has just survived yet another attack by the Kazon. Recently, it's been one attack after another and the ship cannot survive this way for long. So, the Captain is convinced to try some other strategy by Chakotay--to consider an alliance with one of the Kazon factions. However, she soon learns that this is practically impossible and eventually she does find an unlikely ally, the Trabe. It seems this race actually created the ships and technology that were stolen by the Kazon and the Trabe insist they just want to make it out of this part of space and find a new home world. However, such a nice alliance is not something you'd expect in the Delta Quadrant--a part of space that is crawling with races of butt-heads!As I said above, this WAS a very good episode. I loved all the deception and violence in this one. But when the show hit the end, they had a couple minutes to fill and the Captain sat with select crew and bloviated about Federation ideals and niceness. It was simply nauseating!!!!",4

It's during these introductions that the producers decided to add a poorly produced canned sound track. A trumpet fanfare is played as each Maje enters the conference room. A second audio track is then played containing what sounds like seven or eight people applauding their entry into the room. This takes place between episode times 37 min 29 sec and ends at 38 min 09 sec. The introduction of Maje Culluh even include cheering and whistles in admiration.
What could have been an interesting look into the history of the Kazon and their society degenerates into a pathetic grade school quality production thanks to the baffling decision to incorporate these horrible sound tracks into the story. If it weren't for this glaring failure, this episode had the potential to be one of Voyager's finest.",5
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Threshold (TV Episode 1996)",The Worst,"Utterly ridiculous pig-foul.Can I be anymore clear? Utterly ridiculous pig-foul.This episode was a puddle of hot vomit. A dead skunk stuffed down your throat. It's not only the worst episode of any ""Trek,"" it might very well be the worst programming ever broadcast, the worst THING that ever was, and I'm embarrassed to have witnessed the crime.The inconsistency of Voyager has always been a constant- some weeks the crew seems resigned to their fate of being stranded in the Delta quadrant and in others they are willing to risk not only their lives but the very fabric of space-time in order to get home. This episode begins with Torres, Kim and Paris test-piloting a shuttle-craft at trans-warp speeds. In the holodeck.Already we're served two absurd premises. First, Star Trek has created the rule that traveling at a speed faster than Warp 9.9 is impossible, since a craft would theoretically occupy all spaces in the universe at once, breaking every known law of physics and destroying whatever galaxy, reality or dimension in which they exist. Luckily it turns out this Iron Law of Existence can be broken by three curious officers with a couple hours free time. Breaking your own fictional rules is destructive and short-sighted, and the attempt shows the writers' desperation and lack of respect for both ""Trek"" canon and actual scientific knowledge. Adding insult to injury is the fact that they're testing this idea on the ship's holodeck. Insanity goes to Cuckooville.The holodeck, as we all know, is a completely synthetic environment, which reacts solely based on the programmer's instructions. The holodeck has no innate intelligence of its own and cannot be accurately used as a flight simulator since no one could have programmed the holodeck on how to appropriately react! How could the holodeck gain sentience and the foreknowledge of a design problem which even its own programmers could not foresee? How could ANY Captain authorize a mission so inherently dangerous based only a holodeck simulation- with the safeties on? So far the episode has destroyed physics and the entire conceit of the holodeck, as well as the collective reputations of Tom, Torres, Kim and Janeway. And we're only seven minutes in.The test flight begins, and Tom transcends space-time and reaches an infinite identity occupying every molecule of matter at precisely the same instant, gone from Voyager's sensors. But that one moment of quasi-reality is destroyed when Tom reappears- seconds later- in the exact same place from which he started! Just luck I guess... thank you, Universe, for dropping Tommy off so close by. Can you give me a ride to the shoe store?Suddenly, Tom's coffee tastes funny! This is not a drill- Set phasers to Sweet & Low... fire Folgers torpedoes. Tom keels over from the whack java and is rushed to Sick Bay where we learn he's allergic to water. (Luckily not the water that makes up 90% of his body... what a break.)A series of mutations changes every organ in Tom's body. Except his brain. For no reason. We know he will end up completely back to normal by episode's end, so we don't care when the doctor degrades Tom's condition from stable to not-so-stable to dead. And then back to stable. Yes, its true: Tom dies and then returns, growing EXTRA body organs, including a bonus heart- in case the first should ever get broken. Tom evolves into some squishy creature who taunts Janeway and then vomits up his own tongue. Luckily this doesn't stop him from talking. Quel surprise!Doctor comes up with a sloppily-written plan about anti-proton chemotherapy nonsense, which is as meaningless as it sounds. Tommy Boy escapes and miraculously wipes out the ship's computer, stealing a shuttlecraft and bringing Kap'n Kate along with him. He achieves trans-warp again and disappears, but this time he's a whole half-mile away. There's a big surprise when Voyager goes to pick up Paris & Janeway: they're lizards.Yeah, they're lizards, and the episode goes from astoundingly-stupid to mind-blowingly incompetent. Piling on the Awful, Tom & Kate Lizard have mated and spawned Junior Lizards, who go swimming happily into the sea to begin the long process of evolution. Get it? GET IT?!? Oh wait, there's nothing to get, this is just peanut diarrhea in a bowl. With a spoon.Back in Sick Bay Janeway and Tom are human again, thanks to the Doctor's handy De-Lizardizer Machine. Dialogue reaches an all-time low as Paris declares he, ""feels a little overwhelmed.""Janeway tries to encourage him, assuring him that the events of the last few days have won him a newfound respect among the crew(?) Why the writers would pour schmaltz onto an already-excruciating episode is incomprehensible. Brannon Braga- the stunted manchild who secretly hated Trek because he was intimidated by its size and stature- makes his most brazen attempt at killing the series from the inside... and comes dangerously close to succeeding.Robert Duncan MacNeill's acting here is the worst I've seen; he assures the Captain that he learned a very important lesson- it doesn't matter what others think of him, only what he thinks of himself. What the hell is he talking about? Is this Star Trek for the mentally retarded? Because THEY'RE insulted.Janeway inspires Paris to ""keep reaching for that rainbow"" and the pain is finally over. To scrape this low for a storyline in Season Two does not bode well for the life of the series, and to defy rules of your own universe for no good reason is devastating.""Threshold"" is fatally-flawed in conception and offensively executed... the worst of the worst. I reserve the letter grade F for episodes that cross the line between poor and offensive... this show insults the intelligence of every Star Trek fan ever to watch an episode.Congratulations, boys... you've crossed the threshold.GRADE: F",1
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Threshold (TV Episode 1996)",Tom's bout with the Measels,"Brannon Braga always says ""what was I thinking"" when he discusses this episode. No way! In fact I liked it, quite a bit. But not for the reasons you are thinking.Tom is a pilot first and foremost, on top of being a jerk most of the time. In this episode, it appears that he is spearheading a team that has been planning hard designing a shuttle that can do something extraordinary, and he is the man that will pilot this. This is the flight that will give him something that he has wanted since he was a child, a feeling of accomplishment by doing something nobody else has. He is very sincere in all of his efforts and his arguments with Captain Janeway award him the chance to do this thing. But he is almost prevented from doing it because The Doctor thinks he has developed some form of brain-measles. Fortunately, and because we know Tom Paris' character well by this point, he is able to talk himself back into the pilot's seat.However, what begins as a quest to break an ultimate speed barrier, takes a sharp twist and ""devolves"" into insanityland.And I have never laughed so hard for a Star Trek episode, ever!People simply don't appreciate the humor of this episode, especially the non-standard and possibly unintentional (but probably, actually intentional) comic acting by Robert Duncan McNeil. He nails this, if he had not pulled out all of the stops, the episode would have been perceived worse than it has been. But I never have thought of this episode as bad, only as drastically insane. Which was something that we needed at the time due to the serious turns in Trek during this period, with the Dominion and the Founders and Maquis and other threats in Deep Space Nine, to the destruction of the Enterprise D and the Borg Attack in the Next Generation movies of the period. With all of the seriousness of the state of the Federation on the Alpha quadrant side, we really needed something totally crazy to happen in the Delta quadrant side. And this was simply the first time they did it in Voyager, they had some other totally whack episodes after this, but nothing as crazy as this episode. It set a new standard for insanity. Which is why I personally love it.And the ending is just way beyond the pale, when you think it can't get any crazier, it does, and then it even gets more absurd and insane after that, up until the very last scene which is the most incredibly crazy thing that we've ever seen any Star Trek, ever.Y'all simply don't have a sense of humor, enjoy this for what it is, high comedy and absurdity, Star Trek style. Get out the popcorn when this episode plays, pretend like you are watching mst 3000, and enjoy it. I always make a point to watch this at least once every six months, it really lifts me up when I am in the dumps. Whaddya think this is? The last episode of Game of Thrones or something?

OK, so my willing suspension of disbelief goes far enough to cover that Tom breaks Warp 10. It goes further to accept that his medical condition or the lack of sufficient protection (or both) lead to dire consequences. What I can't accept is the Doctor's explanation that Tom (and later the Captain) are *evolving*, only to turn into hairless aquatic mammals that give birth over a span of only 3 days.

4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Threshold (TV Episode 1996)",Non Canon but Interesting,"*Contains Spoilers* Okay, this is a terrible episode for many reasons. I and many consider it non-canon because it confuses many topics. So many questions and might go beyond the description ""Weird is part of the job"". Why leave the babies behind? Why do multiple ST series deal with warp 10 differently? (Maybe there are unpredictable and different effects in the ST universe?) It also has awkward dialogue. The episode pace seems to simultaneously go too quickly and too slowly.However I still gave it 4 stars because the idea behind this episode is fascinating. The idea that evolution might be cyclical and that we could evolve into something that is less advanced. I feel this is a comparison to our current society. Our society is getting sicker, lazier, and probably less intelligent as we ""evolve"". What are we transforming into? At the end of the day, isn't that what we all love Trek for?

Until I saw ""Threshold."" I can cut the original series some slack: low ratings, under-funded, under the gun to get a new episode out every week, and the original series had its stinkers, and ""Spock's Brain"" was the best example of the worst episode ever to carry the ""Star Trek"" brand. Until now.And there was no excuse. Now the ""Star Trek"" franchise has everything the original series did not have: money, ratings, multi-generational fan base, computer generated graphics -- you name it, they had it.And then there is this. It even makes the animated series look good. This is probably the most hated episode of all time for several reasons: 1. It takes upon itself to completely destroy the delightfully vague ""warp"" rules of physics. For those of us who have been around for a while, and know that warp 13 or higher can happen, the silly idea of warp 10 being ""everywhere in the universe at once"" is disgusting. 2. Turning to a lizard. I'm too sick to comment further. 3. Being able to conceive and have lizard children in a few hours. Ditto. 4. Everybody being normal again at the end after the doctor figures something out. I know; it happens all the time. But in ""Spock's Brain,"" even McCoy forgot how he fixed things when it was over. The doctor just made up a two-minute fix that got Paris and Janeway back to their original forms again, with no apparent psychological trauma, but maybe a pretty wacky memory for each of them to hold on to for the rest of their lives. To the show's credit (and here is the only really nice thing I can say about it) they did not merely use the old transporter fix and revert them to the patterns in the buffer like all the other series did several times -- that got really old.I really don't need to write a scathing review here. Someone has beaten me to it, and done an excellent job.But as someone who sat through ""Star Trek: the Motion Picture,"" and ""Star Trek V,"" as well as ""Plato's Step Children"" and ALL of seasons 1 and 2 of ""The Next Generation,"" I think I have the right to say that this was the worst of the worst ever.And I am a big fan of ""Voyager."" In some ways, it was my favorite series.But the ""Spock's Brain"" trophy for worst episode ever must leave the glass show case of the original series archives, and be awarded to this pathetic episode, the worst that ever was. I hear that true trekkers do not consider this episode ""canon,"" and I thank them for that.This was just a wild dream that Paris had after eating something -- er -- green, that Neelix called ""chili.""",1

This is the worst of the series, just when it was improving.",2
8,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Threshold (TV Episode 1996)",Can this be as horrible as I just read?!,"According to IMDb, this is among the most hated episodes of the series. And, when I read through the six reviews for the show, one was lukewarm and the other five totally hated it. So is this really that bad? After all, there have been so many horrible episodes of the various Star Trek shows! Mind you, I love the shows but I also am honest enough with myself to admit that on rare occasions the Trek shows and films let down the viewers. I am a fan but I am NOT a fanatic!When the show begins, Paris and a few other crew members are working on trying to achieve warp 10. We are told that in theory this would allow for instantaneous travel ANYWHERE...but is it possible? Well, eventually they are ready to test this outside the holodeck and Paris insists that he be allowed to pilot the shuttle on the attempt. At first, it seems to work...but of course it cannot work perfectly, otherwise the series would come to an end and they'd all be home in the middle of the second season!What follows reminds me a lot of the remake of ""The Fly"" but with a lot less coherence. It also wasn't bad...that is until the end. Then, it became completely bat$&#* crazy...as well as stupid! You really have to see this one to believe it...but I can see much of why folks disliked this episode...it was kooky indeed! But is it the worst? I don't think so, as the final episode of the original series featured Kirk getting a sex change and suffering a HUGE menopausal mood shift, a terrible ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" episode involving a baseball game in the holodeck and much of season one and two of ""Star Trek: Voyager"" at least give it a run for the money as worst episode!UPDATE: By the way, it isn't just me who hated this episode.

It wasn't that bad however; it is by no means a great episode but I didn't think it was terrible either.The story follows Tom Paris' attempt to break the transwarp barrier, something that was always considered impossible. He manages to do it however but when he gets back something is wrong with him. At first he seems okay but suddenly collapses and starts to mutate, at one point he appears to have died but much to the Doctor's surprise he recovers. We later learn that these aren't random mutations but highly accelerated evolution. During an attempt to delete all the mutate genes he escapes and kidnaps Captain Janeway and flees in the transwarp shuttle. By the time Voyager finds them they have both evolved into what look like giant salamanders and have even had off spring... luckily for them after they are cured the memories of what happened fade.The story itself was good enough although it did have its faults; it is said that when they go at warp ten they are at every point in the universe simultaneously, if this is so it seems unlikely that they would end up a mere three days away from Voyager.",6

13,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Threshold (TV Episode 1996)",Not even bad in a funny way,"This really is pretty horrible. Even though the entire episode is not homogeneously stupid - at first, there is some minor interest. I mean, sure, infinite velocity is wrong in so many ways, and the way an impossible thing is achieved by some guy who found a special rock and got good advice from an obnoxious chef in a matter of hours is laughable. But still, the effects of ""I was everywhere at once"" could be interesting. If they were psychological. But no. Travelling at infinite velocity de-evolves you (to a leper goblin, apparently). Of course there are people whose complaint is that other star treks have shown warp 12 and 13, not that, but clearly, understanding anything is not the point in any aspect of this episode.After all this, the only thing that could half-save the episode would be if they just killed Paris. But no. Both he and the captain turn into salamanders, and are easily transformed back to humans because DUH, why not go full bananas at this stage?From all the star trek I've seen, this was definitely the stupidest episode - but maybe not the worst, I save that for DS9's Rapture, for being both very stupid and going against everything Star Trek stands for.PS: since the effects are so easily reversible, why can't they go back and fix themselves afterwards?",2
14,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Threshold (TV Episode 1996)",Did they steal the idea for this episode from a 5 year old?,"This episode is really bad. Let me try to explain so without giving too much away. First of all, there is not so much suspense and it feels quite boring, but okay; that can happen, and suspense has never been the primary focus of star trek. However, no interesting moral questions are raised, nor are any interesting scientific/futuristic concepts presented. In fact, the concepts presented sound like those of a 5 year old. Let me summarize these concepts (I hope this doesn't count as a spoiler): if you travel past warp 10 (a threshold this episode suddenly came up with; and is not adhered to in some other star trek canon) you are everywhere, but apparently also at different points in time. Slowing down will make you miraculously pop up very close to where you left when you went to warp 10. Rather than traditional evolution which happens over many generations, if you are everywhere and at ever moment in time, your DNA suddenly changes to whatever a human ancestors or successors DNA looked/will look like at some specific time in the past/future.

Tom Paris is the lucky, lucky chap piloting the test shuttle. More by accident than design, the contraption seems to work, then Paris disappears (cue much false jepordy) before miraculously reappearing right next to Voyager (how kind of fate to drop Paris off right here in the suspiciously crowded Delta Quadrant - seriously half the Alpha Quad seems to land here in Voyager's run!) Following all this 'excitement' the writers then have what appears to be a moment of absolute madness - the Warp 10 jump seems to cause Paris to die (yay!), revive (boo!), kindnap Janeway (eh?!) before taking her back onto the test shuttle through the W.10 barrier where they promptly both de-evolve into oversided Samalanders, mate and produce muntant amphibious offspring (Wtf?!?!) Yes folks seriously that's what happens.....no amount of alcohol or hallucinogenics could produce a script this bad, the only sane conclusion is that writer Brannon Braga secretly hated Trek and set out to sabotage the show with this intergalactic turkey (actually based on his later writing on Enterprise and Voyager's later years that's not an unreasonable hypothesis)There is nothing remotely redeemable about this episode, Voyager itself was a show which was riddled by internal inconsistencies elaborated on by other reviewers, one of its worst being the 'reset button' phenomenon - at the end of each episode everything just reverts to normal, everyone plods on trudging their way through duff scripts and stock nebula footage hoping a passing Borg or some wayward Romulans to put them out of their misery, and actions very rarely have consequences.

After the meld Suder seems calmer but Tuvok finds himself feeling violent urges, and even uses the holodeck to act on those feelings. Eventually he loses control and must be restrained behind a forcefield in sickbay while the doctor tries to find a cure. He manages to escape however and sets off to kill Suder during another meld.This was a good episode although it was a pity that we'd not even heard of Suder before this episode, Brad Dourif was good in the role. The real acting credits go to Tim Russ who portrayed Tuvok's loss of control very well. While I'm not usually a fan of scenes which take place on the holodeck where we don't initially know it is just a simulation it was fun to see Tuvok finally react to Neelix's attention.

I know that Tuvok, although he's 100% Vulcan, has a very short temper and often exhibits great impatience, and this is one instance where he really goes over the top---most unusual for the guy I call the Great Stone Face! He and Brad Dourif, who portrays the murderous Lon Suder, both turn in superb performances, and I really got a fine understanding of the ins and outs of the Vulcan.

However, this one is actually excellent. The show begins with the body of a murdered crew member being discovered. Crewman Suder is soon identified as the killer and this Betazoid soon admits he did it and it seems that he murdered because he enjoyed killing. As Tuvak is in charge of the case, he's completely perplexed as this sort of antisocial thinking is completely un-Vulcan.

This is definitely not Roddenberry's Starfleet...To lighten the mood of the episode Tuvok performs a mind meld with the unrepentant psychopath and emerges bloodthirsty, violent, and emotionally unstable. The techno-babble particularly irked me here: the Doctor ""turns off"" Tuvok's emotion suppressors like a light switch and Kes ""disables"" Tuvok's telepathic abilities like unplugging a toaster. The Vulcan mind meld was supposed to be a spiritual, mystical encounter, not a scientific process that can be analyzed and quantified. This is the beginning of Voyager becoming far too reliant on their ""science,"" which they seemed to forget was pure fiction.The Doctor informs the Captain that there is a battle raging in Tuvok's mind between good and evil (relative terms, no?) and later that he is back to ""normal"" in spite of the fact that it is impossible to translate brain waves and cat scans into behavior and demeanor.

Suder not having a motive for killing really shouldn't have been all that perplexing to Tuvok. Suder is clearly mentally ill. That should have been a logical enough explanation but instead Tuvok acts like there is no logic about it and has an existential crisis. It's not a black mark against the episode or anything, especially since he really starts to fall apart after melding with Suder, giving Tuvok a taste of the crazy.",8

It had been captured by the Maquis and reprogrammed to attack a Cardassian target however before reaching its target it was lost in the Badlands. At the time they assumed it was destroyed but now it is apparent that it was brought to the Delta Quadrant by the same array that brought Voyager and the Maquis ship there in the opening episode. Luckily the person who reprogrammed the weapon is B'Elanna Torres, so if anybody can deactivate it she can... unfortunately though she only has a limited time to do it as the weapon has found a planet that resembles its original target, a planet with several million inhabitants. At first B'Elanna thinks she has successfully deactivated it but hadn't counted on the efficiency of her own programming when it reactivates assuming that she must have been coerced by the Cardassians. As she struggles to stop the attack it looks as if she may have to sacrifice herself to protect an alien culture from the weapon she launched.This was a decent episode centred on B'Elanna, Roxann Dawson did a good job in that role and as the voice of the weapon. As the weapon got closer to the target the tension raised nicely.

I could be wrong, but these two factors up the ante for the otherwise weak story and make the drama more urgent and personal. If B'Elanna had simply failed in reprogramming Dreadnought she could not be blamed for its current threat, but since her admission that she had defied Chakotay's orders there is an added responsibility on her part.If she had indeed defied Chakotay and he was covering for her at the briefing, why was there no look or exchange from him to show that he knew more than he was saying? Additionally, why was there no follow-up whatsoever on this supposed secret she shared with Chakotay? There is no scene in which they discuss it, no sign on his part that he knew anything more than what he reported to the Captain. Strange, no?B'Elanna's voice on the Dreadnought's computer seems heavy-handed and repetitive. How many times can we marvel at the the irony that she seems to be battling herself or repenting for her own sins? This is an unremarkable episode with an unresolved plot line: why was Tom disheveled? Because he's bored with Starfleet regulations? This is not even close to a substantial B-story in the episode, and again feels shoe-horned in for some future payoff.It is only Janeway's interaction with the leader of the threatened planet and her self-destruct sacrifice that give the episode any substance.

And here they are with what is essentially a drone that can wipe out a fleet of starships??!!! WTF?! This totally upsets the delicate race/ship/technology/power balance we have become accustomed to since TNG. bottom line is that if the Cardassians had these they would have used them to conquer the alpha quadrant.

Fortunately, Torres thinks she can stop it...but the process isn't nearly as simple as she thinks. After all, she doesn't realize that Dreadnought has the ability and willingness to lie--even to her, its creator. How all this actually ends up is very talky...very.

Not only is he well known for humorous campy horror, and quite capable of playing a de Lancie-type trickster Q himself, he sold us on a sympathetic Q...an adorably selfless and philosophical Q.He maintained the Q humour, but where de Lancie plays (to perfection) fun arrogance, he played sweet whimsy. I also give this episode kudos for showing a pathos side of (de Lancie) Q. One that feels. One that understands immortality perhaps, even if he doesn't wish it upon himself like his counterpart.Graham fits the Q family perfectly (above Bernsen or Plakson).

When the Q we know turns up to return him to his prison he bounces Voyager across time and space in a futile attempt to evade his pursuer. Eventually he realises he can't escape and asks Janeway for asylum and she agrees to have a hearing to decide the matter. Q brings witnesses including Commander Riker to show how the other Q had changed human history for the better and for the first time in any series we see the Continuum, or at least a representation of it that humans can understand, here it is clear that the Q do not lead interesting lives, being immortal they have done everything and discussed everything and seem indifferent to everything. As the hearing draws to a close the captain has a difficult decision to make; condemn Q to eternity in a prison or allow him to become mortal and take his own life.I'm not a big fan of the Q, while they are interesting characters their god-like powers make them a bit too all powerful to be believable even within the realms of Star Trek. Seeing them inside the Continuum was interesting though. Guest stars John de Lancie and Gerrit Graham did good jobs as the two Qs.

But, to muck up the subsequent hearing, Q isn't above trying to bribe the Captain with what everyone wants on the ship--to return home.Like almost all Q episodes, this one is enjoyable and rather fun despite the suicide angle.

There, that's better.John DeLancie is back as the ultimate effeminate community theater playhouse performer, the kind of guy who gives you his home number after rehearsal and tells you to call him anytime, and as usual he brings an energy and life that's oddly missing from ALL of the Trek series, even in their best episodes. Here he demands that the escaped Q2 be returned to his prison cell in the tail of a comet (don't ask) and be denied the right to die like a mortal.The high points here the trial, in which Q2 pleads for his right to die and brings to mind classic TOS Trek. Also great is the look inside the Q continuum in a metaphoric representation that we humans can understand. It's full of just the right amount of surreal imagery and disconnect that we can almost comprehend that which we know is incomprehensible. Also good is the romantic, erotic relationship Q develops with Janeway, who seems to be getting sexier and more moist with every episode. She also seems to be in desperate need of a good bang, which only makes her more hot and desirable. Sometimes she whispers her lines like a mother to a baby and sometimes she hisses them like a snake protecting her den... either way it's a sultry, sensual experience and I can definitely see the attraction.The episode is thought-provoking, featuring a forgettable cameo by Johnathan Frakes as William Riker, and we're left wondering yet again what the mission of the Voyager series really is... getting home?

Janeway will be the deciding factor in favor of or against Graham. The very state of the Continuum's existence could be deeply affected by Janeway's ruling. To think, Graham's Q was found imprisoned inside a comet, put there by the Continuum because they felt he was mentally imbalanced and a threat to them! To think, the Voyager's journey through the unknown quadrant had them encountering a sentenced Q who now has the opportunity to be freed from a sentence of immortality he no longer desires but wished to escape. If you see Jonathan Frakes in the credits, don't get too giddy as his part in this episode is brief. If he had a greater part, Frakes' Riker would have overwhelmed the story. De Lancie, as he always did in the Trek Universe, knows how to make an entrance and dominate his screen time. Here he even makes no qualms about his attraction to Janeway! The trial itself questions suicide and if Graham's conditions warrant such, but Janeway's ruling, even as Q offers a trip back to Earth (!), is made with great judgment and perception. Seeing the Continuum come under review, with Graham calling their current status into question (boring immortality where little ""fun"" or ""irresponsibility"" disrupts the apple cart) and Q entrapped by his reasoning for wanting to leave is quite compelling and contemplative. De Lancie calling himself as a witness and offering up both questions and answers is just exactly what his Q would do. Q sacrificing his disruptive antics which allowed him to cause all kind of trouble and catering to the Continuum's demands to behave also used against him by GrahamDe Lancie's reaction is part of why this episode works so well. That De Lancie would cave and grant Graham what he wishes really says that his words made an impact. Riker's momentary visit to the ship was nice (but all too short) while it lasts, and his chance to shake Janeway's hand is a rub from The Next Generation to Voyager. Except for the visit to the Continuum which is like walking off a desert road to a shack in the middle of nowhere is a bit too small scale for my tastesyou always try to imagine just what it would be like, and I felt this was far from it. Mulgrew's performance at the end, as Janeway looks down at Graham who was aided by De Lancie with poison, hits the right note...you can't help but feel such loss of potential in ""Quinn"". Most bizarre sequence: the Voyager find themselves on a Christmas tree thanks to Q who looks at them as if they are an ornament! How Quinn impacted Earth in ways like influencing the apple that would fall to Isaac Newton and help Ginsberg get to Woodstock so the music would play is a nifty bit of history, as Q telling Janeway that he inadvertently caused the 100 year war between the Vulcans and Romulans!",8

In secondary plots Tom Paris is continuing to turn up late for shifts and when told he isn't needed till he can turn up on time he knows Chakotay to the floor, interestingly this storyline is not resolved; I suspect it is building up to a story which will be the main plot in an upcoming episode.This was a good episode as most ones centred on the Doctor are, Robert Picardo is very good in the role, Susan Diol made a welcome guest appearance as the Vidiian Dr. Danara Pel, her scenes with the Doctor were very touching.

Naturally, this relationship is unconventional....but is it even possible? And, if so, will she reciprocate?There are two other plots running throughout this episode. First, Paris continues behaving like a nasty butt-head--particularly towards Commander Chakotay. And, when Chakotay tries to find out what's happening, Paris is extremely rude and combative. Second, the weasel, Lucas, is still working for the Kazon and these baddies are trying to get him to damage Voyager. Interestingly, in the near future, both these subplots will converge.This episode clearly gives the Doctor the greatest opportunity to express himself, grow as a character and become more human.

If we can synthesize substitute bodies and successfully transfer our brains into them haven't we achieved immortality? Why wouldn't the Federation be staffing starships with all-hologram crews and keep the humans safe at home while their immortal, invincible counterparts brave the galaxy with no chance of death or destruction? Why is the hologram Doctor on board Voyager having romantic feelings in the first place? Who programmed into him the ability to love a woman? And why? I guess the writers do it whenever the script calls for him to have a love-themed episode.I'd like to take a moment here to reflect on how the concept of holo-technology has helped to ruin the Star Trek franchise. Week after week we're treated to decoy scenes and scenarios that are revealed to be only holodeck simulations. Science is distorted and ignored, like the dying woman's rental body or the stupefying shuttlecraft flight simulator in ""Threshold."" The holodeck and its offshoots have become an excuse for lazy writers to bridge any gaps between fantasy and reality, and what was once fascinating and thought-provoking for the fan has now become numbingly predictable. Take, for example, the date on which the holo-Doctor takes his holo-girlfriend. They sit in their holo-57 Chevy, in the holo-desert overlooking a holo-canyon and holo-sunset. The entire experience just left me... hollow.Like Data in TNG, we're left to wonder what the difference is between humans and Doc Hologram, who have the same broad band of emotions. His search for love here is less tragic than it is bizarre. Why should we care if this projection gets laid or not? The Doctor- whose hook was that he was a mere hologram- becomes less remarkable the more human he becomes.The Tom Paris-is-burning subplot again goes nowhere: Tom is late to work and gives lame excuses to Chakotay. Oooh!

Also Jonas in Engineering is in contact with the Kazon, particularly Seska, as they want him to damage the warp coils.Now the main story follows the Doctor and how he develops romantic feelings for the holographic form of a patient going through cell / tissue death due to the Phage. Her name is Danara Pel (Susan Diol), a Vidiian physician helping her people through the Phage. Seeing herself fully healthy and feeling so, Danara finds this form alluring and soon desires not to return to the diseased body that is considered so ugly. Doctor even gets a name in this one, given to him by Danara, ""Shumulla"". Doctor tries to understand these new feelings and adapt accordingly. Kes is such a wonderful character, and her involvement in helping both Doctor and Danara gain clarity in their progressive romance is a highlight of the episode. Good chemistry between Picardi and Diol really helps enhance the whole episode. Their bond is organic and pleasant. How holographic programs can ""adapt"" is of great concentration in this episode's overall storyto allow Picardi to take this character and move him beyond just medical dialogue and doctor speech is necessary so that we can ourselves adapt to him and care about his continual growth. This episode does that splendidly. The Vidiian disease and how certain among them fear others is commented on as Danara laments about her current situation and what it is like to walk around in her holographic form not repulsive and diseased. Diol is humane, kind, and undeserved of her lot in lifebut she's needed and even though she attempts to poison herself, much to Doctor's chagrin, he urges her to think of her worth to others combating similar disease.

How ANYONE could want to serve aboard a ship filled with Neelix-like beings is beyond me--and the REAL reason for all this grouchiness is explained...and it's NOT because Paris is somehow reliving his teenage years!!Although the other plot in this episode might seem to have little initially to do with the Paris plot, the traitor aboard the ship is once again doing things to help the dreaded Kazon--such as disabling the warp drive. This and Paris' leaving the ship motivate Neelix to investigate these things on his own--and he stumbles into something BIG! And, as a nice change of pace, Neelix turns out to NOT be a total idiot and comic relief.It's nice to see that during season two, the writers considered using some plot elements that transcended multiple episodes--in this case, Paris' REAL motivations. My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that once again, the crew of Voyager has a chance to shoot Seska and end her reign of terror once and for all but they don't-- which just didn't make a lot of senses.

Thomas Paris has been behaving insubordinately lately which has resulted in his estrangement from his superiors, including Chakotay. He decides to leave the Voyager, taking a position on Neelix's old friend's convoy ship. Thomas is abducted by the Kazon loyalist, Seska (Martha Hackett), and his mission is to retrieve vital Intel that will snuff out the spy on the Voyager through retrieved communications on the vessel that currently holds him captive. Neelix is eventually clued in on Paris' behavior, that is was all a ruse, after he finds supposed (actually planted by the real spy) logs derived from his quarters. Chakotay was also left out in the dark on this due to his ties to the Maquis, and his response of disgruntlement is understandable. But Tuvok's decision (not to place him in an awkward position) was reasonable under the circumstances.Not highly regarded by Star Trek critical community, I thought it was a rather splendid Neelix episode. He even gets to be the hero, disrupting the spy's (Raphael Sbarge) efforts in engineering, during a struggle. The spy, Jonas, has carte blanche to cause plenty of problems to those on the Voyager, like disabling weapons and the shields if Neelix doesn't interfere. Hurling Jonas into a plasma stream which just deteriorates him in quick order, Neelix essentially helps in saving the Voyager from certain doom. Also Paris is a hero as well, learning of plans that the Kazon have with ships waiting at a certain sector to attack the Voyager, hoping to get off the ship imprisoning him so he can communicate back to Janeway what is waiting in store for them. Paris' escape from the Kazon ship and his character arc which had him acting out in ways that left many around him rather bothered and frustrated both conclude that storyline herethis might be a reason behind its considered failure (to many who rate it unflatteringly). Story arcs end, and it seems the show was ready to take Paris to a much better place alongside the crew he serves with. Picardo's AI Doctor interested in Neelix's ""video newspaper"" provides some nice recurring humor in a rather serious episodeespecially as Neelix avoids him due to more pressing matters needing his attention. Some good action at the end. Phillips is good fun with much of the story time dedicated to him. If the episode perhaps hurts a character/subplot, it sacrifices emphasis on Paris so that Neelix could get the majority of the episode's running time.",6

This was a nice scene, which everyone can relate to... no matter how you feel about someone you're forced to reconsider them when you realize you may never see them again. After a touching scene and on-air tribute, Tom departs and is promptly kidnapped by the Kazon.Ready for the big surprise?

It is his rather aggressive and annoying MO that brings awareness of something amiss on Voyager. We have, for many episodes, been watching that engineering jerk compromise the ship by engaging the Kason. We never know how much we can believe Neelix. He doesn't seem very formidable physically, but he did participate in war. His confrontation with the enemy shows that when pushed, he can handle himself. The big plot involves Paris leaving Voyager for greener pastures. How can this be, you ask, oh television series watcher. That's the mystery. We also get to see Ceska (or as I like to call her, Fresca). She is despicable. I suppose since she is pregnant, they can't just shoot her. I'm sure that despite the conclusion of the episode, she's still out there, doing her thing. But, overall, there was lots of action, mystery, and fun.",9

Due to complications the Doctor has to beam the baby out of Ensign Wildman. Things start going even worse just before B'Elanna starts a process that should restart the warp drive. As systems across the ship start to fail the baby dies and while trying to repair a hull breach Harry is killed and another engineering officer is injured. Kes is sent to Engineering to treat him but just as she is bout to reach him B'Elanna sees her disappear. We soon learn that Voyager was somehow duplicated as it passed through the cloud, one is severely damaged but the other is fine. The people on the good ship realise that when a second Kes turns up and work to find a way to get in touch with the second ship. Attempts to recombine the ships fail and as it looks as if they will both be lost it is decided that the only way to save one of the ships is to destroy the other. As one is heavily damaged the captain of that one decides to make the sacrifice but before she can do anything the Vidiians attack, they enter the good ship and it turns out that this is the ship which must be sacrificed but not before its Harry can go back with the baby to replace those that had died.This was a better episode that had a surprisingly bleak start; I certainly didn't expect to see the death of a baby and a main character on an episode of Star Trek, even if they did find a way for them to be back by the end of the episode. I was also rather surprised when it was the heavily damaged ship that was ultimately saved meaning that as the episode concluded they still had a lot of work to do. It was rather fun watching two Captain Janeways arguing about what should be done to solve the problem. While it might be seen as a cop out for Harry and the baby to escape the doomed ship to replace those lost I think it was the right thing as Harry is a good character and the baby will grow to be the least annoying Star Trek child.",9
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Deadlock (TV Episode 1996)",An infuriating summary of Voyager as a series,"After remembering Voyager as a relatively dreadful show, I thought I'd rewatch it to see if the show was, in fact, as bad as I remember. However, in some ways, it was even worse than I remember. For a crew built off both Maquis and Starfleet, there is almost no tension, despite the fact that both groups are shown as at constant odds in (far superior) story-arcs of DS9. And yet, for the very rare exception of a tiff or two, generally speaking, everyone adapts very quickly to Starfleet life, becomes best mates, and spends an annoying amount of time on holodecks. If there are any arguments, they are resolved instantly and without any tension or believability. For a ship stranded in the middle of nowhere with few resources, there are very few consequences of any permanence. Sure, they might run out of fruit and veg occasionally, but they can replicate more. A uniform might get a tear or a burn, but the next scene, clean uniforms.Now, TNG had some problems - certainly, some very severe problems that could be discussed at a later time. And it also had a tendency to reboot itself with very few consequences - literally seen in an episode where they repeatedly set alá Groundhog Day. But one thing TNG did do? They killed off Tasha Yar in 'Skin of Evil'. Tasha was a main character - her name was on the credits, her picture was in the main cast images. But in killing off Tasha, they proved that anything could happen - so when other characters came into danger, like Picard being kidnapped by the Borg, there was every possibility that Picard could be killed off. It didn't really even matter that he wasn't killed off - the threat that he could be killed off was enough. Voyager has no 'Skin of Evil' episode that proved something dramatic could happen - that we should take them seriously and understand that just because someone was in the main credits did not mean they were going to be safe. Voyager never learnt to take the risks that TNG and DS9 did - and as a result, Voyager's constant resetting at the end of every episode was never met with any dramatic tension. No one of consequence died, no one would ever really be permanently dead. At the end of the day, the fact that they are stranded in the Delta quadrant means absolutely nothing. Uniforms can be torn, a panel can catch on fire, but there is never a doubt that this will reset. It is this element that so strongly exhausts and infuriates me. 'Deadlock' was the the only episode thus far on my rewatch that caught my attention: disaster happens with fatal consequences to several characters, including Ensign Kim and a baby of a reoccurring character. The holographic doctor loses power, and there is a problem that cannot be solved. Now, I wasn't cheering at the death of the characters and destruction. No, I was cheering the fact that for the first half of this episode, there were going to be consequences that were not instantly resolved - things on the ship that could not be instantly fixed. Characters that were going to have to make permanent adaptations and changes. Consequences. And then, 20 minutes in, we're told that all of the potentially interesting stuff that's happened is on a mirror version of Voyager - and once again, we see a shiny non-consequential version of Voyager that survives in the end. No consequences. And the tiny tease of real drama -- of real threat -- is stripped from the show before it even gets an opportunity to take a foot hold. Harry and the baby get to survive, The ship is repaired with no complications. The next episode, the ship is in perfect working order, and it doesn't even matter what happened in the previous episode. This episode essentially serves as a summary of Voyager as a whole: an interesting but unformed idea, smothered with cringe-worthy dialogue, a non-existent attempt at intensity, and a promise that whatever moment you think you could -- for just a single moment, be interested in what could happen on this show -- will be crushed and wrapped up in a bland, tasteless, unsalted stale saltine.",2
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Deadlock (TV Episode 1996)",Just a Lot to Ingest,"The business of parallel spaceships has been done before. This one stretched my credibility. Of course, one would have to buy into the whole business of the ship and crew being duplicated. That's a big if. Of course, the problem with series television, we can't wipe out most of the crew or even a few of the characters. So at some point this has to be reconciled. There are some moral issues as those grave robbers show up. Should one entity die to allow the ship to carry on? I guess, as others have said, the whole thing asks a lot of the viewer. Is there even a reality, existing in science fiction, that would allow this to take place? It was exciting and entertaining at times and the characters are heroic, but let's not ask too many questions.",7
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Deadlock (TV Episode 1996)",Star Trek: Voyager - Deadlock,"While I thought this episode was fun, it is a logic and plot hole nightmare. It just doesn't hold up to much scrutiny, but if somehow you can roll with it, there's some entertainment value. It throws a ton of trek-y jargon regarding space scission (a type of rift that causes duplicate Voyagers and duplicate crews), shared anti-matter, photon bursts, and space/time rift to compensate for the trippy idea of seeing Captain Janeway talking with Captain Janeway about saving their respective ships and crews. You get a chance to see Harry Kim perishing during a repairs job through a hull breach on one Voyager, and his counterpart replacing him from one ship to another. And there's the death of one infant and its counterpart being carried by Kim through a passable rift from one Voyager to another. The significance of the infant is that she is the first to be born on Voyager. Seeing one Voyager under serious system catastrophe, as all the machinations coming under siege by photon bursts resulting in severe damage and injury/death to crew, while another is unaffected, and Janeways coordinating efforts to either merge or preserve their ships; this has a lot of creative and outre ideas. Is this episode successful? Well, it certainly isn't boring!Whether you want to tear apart phase discriminator use and non-use during key moments or just the quantum duplicate story logic itself (not to mention the umbilical cord of the use of antimatter for both Voyagers severed by auto destruct which might have resulted in both ships destroyed), a Voyager in tatters, with the Bridge burning and operations continuing in Engineering, including bizarre subplot involving organ-harvest Vidiians taking advantage of the alternate less-affected Voyager unable to defend itself against a boarding and subsequent attack, just gives us a lot to consume over such a quick forty-five minutes block...this is actually a cinematic story in desperate need of fleshing out and further time to develop. At the most, this is a two-parter which could have benefited from a strong cliffhanger. Not only does it finish all nice and neat, the plot plays so loosely with versions of people meeting each other and passing through rifts into duplicate ships, I agree with others that balk about its share of problems. Still, seeing multiple Janeways, one a little more worse for wear than the other, conversing and even arguing about end results, is quite incredible. Sacrifice, gallantry, and valor all integral parts of Janeway...In both of the Captains.",6

I am actually surprised how highly this one is rated...I didn't think very much of it.When the show begins, Voyager encounters the nasty Vidiians (though you barely see them until late in the show) and all kinds of terrible stuff happens--such as losing Harry Kim and the first baby born on Voyager dies. However, soon the ship is able to make contact with an identical Voyager! And, the two Captain Janeways are actually able to meet and converse! What's to become of all this? See the show and find out how (uggh!) it all works out just fine by the end of the program.I guess my biggest problem with this one is a serious problem with too many episodes of the series--horrible things happen and then unhappen! I would have preferred crew dying...period. But seeing miraculous endings where everything just works out fine is a bit silly-- especially when it happens repeatedly. In addition, using 'spatial flux' as an automatic answer also seems awfully familiar. I wasn't impressed.",4

He is hilarious, maintaining his stoic Vulcaness while trying to placate the little ones. One interesting factor has to do with the secrecy of the inhabitants of the planet. Initially, I thought, ""Why don't you just tell them about your belief system"" and the uniqueness of your species. Then I thought, the self righteous would come running to try to change things.

""Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" type plot is quite a stunner, and the final scene where Tuvok agrees to the honorable ""watch"" with little girl Tressa (Tiffany Taubman) really tugged on my heartstrings. The Voyager encounters an isolationist race known as the Drayans, hoping for diplomatic relations. The Drayans have particular crystals of great importance to the Voyager, with Janeway hoping diplomatic trust and ongoing talks can result in prosperity for both parties, jeopardized by a developing situation where Tuvok's shuttle craft crashes on a moon due to the turbulent ionosphere. Tuvok loses a member of his two party shuttle crew due to the crash, and three Drayan children (Taubman, Sarah Freeman, and Tahj Mowry) emerge from the nearby forest looking for his protection. Drayan representative, Alicia (Marnie McPhail), knows of Tuvok's ""interference"" in keeping the children on the moon ""safe from the morok"" and commissions a mission to prevent him from doing so. The children tell Tuvok that their shuttle craft also crashed on the moon, with the adult crew perishing and that a monster in a cave comes out at night to kill them (as it has other children).The novelty of Tuvok in charge of children who misbehave and want to play with his shuttle devices as if they were toys (and be the one who sits closest to him while working on repairs) is the real pleasure of this particular episode. He speaks on how the Vulcan adults hold nothing secret from their children, not keeping secrets from them, believing ""make believe monsters"" should be discounted, especially teaching them of logic's role in their upbringing. He even sings a folk tale to get them to sleep at a campfire during the night which offers quite a special moment in the episode. His handling of them, and a devotion to protect and rescue them, is a real treat. Meanwhile Janeway must find a way to try and rescue Tuvok as Alicia and her Drayan crew becomes agitated and unsettled by another race disrupting their natural order of thingsand the children's fate on the moon is a major part of that. I enjoyed the early exchange between Janeway and her #1 Chakotay regarding diplomatic introductions with new races, as it produces back stories shared between respected colleagues on past mistakes and philosophies, with them meeting the Drayan officials professionally and warmly. I like how a terribly difficult situation is eventually handled proficiently. But this is Tuvok's episode all the way and how he deals with an unexpected situation is quite satisfying. This episode shows that in the Trek universe meeting new races and achieving common ground and respect isn't always an easy road but can be successful when there is understanding. Tuvok's initial resistance towards Alicia's demands to leave the children on the planet, vowing to see Tressa is protected, is honorable.",7
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Innocence (TV Episode 1996)",Despite the acting and the premise it is an abysmal episode,"The most curious thing about this episode is that if Belenna had been in it she would have reversed the plasma stream through the gravitational nodes and then enriched it with antimatter and injected into the teleporter stream to create a window through the electrostatic storm surrounding the moon. Then they would have teleported Tuvok and the kids out of their without issues. Pity Janeway and Kim didn't think of that one.So now we have to deal with the story.When rewatching old Star Trek series on Netflix you get to meet the good, the bad, the truly remarkable and the astonishing atrocious. That one episiode can have it all is possibly shown by Innocence.First the good: Tuvok played by Tim Russ. I find him a believable Vulcan. Tuvok has crashed on some kind of moon where a group of children have been stranded too. We see him interact with these children, thus confronting him with the unruly and emotional. We learn a bit about the Vulcans and how they learn to control their emotions and become logical.Now to continue I would have to reveal the clue of the episode, there is no other way. The clue is that the species the Voyager meets this time has a reversed aging process. Now this isn't revealed until the very end. In fact this is truly bad because the whole confrontation and what happens in the episode would not have occured if the leader of the species had told Janeway the moment tensions arose.Now one can argue that they only became aware that the Voyager crew has a reversed aging process as compared to themselves near the end but we never see them go though these motions. In fact: it is just mentioned before at the final confrontation. Oh, they don't know we have a reversed aging process; the kid is 96 years old. Note the sentense? We have a reversed one. This assumes they accept that the norm is different from theirs. But how would a species that deliberately isolates itselfs, so we are informed, assume or know that they are abnormal?But then we run into various problems. Does this reverse process also entail that they forget everything they learned? The kids act as kids do and show the usual neglect of experience and understanding. In fact they don't even know they come to die because they tell Tuvok that it is a monster who takes them away and the others of their kind are out to kill them. And when Tuvok goes to investigate he finds only the clothes of the kids in the cave they are too afraid to go into. Why did they go into a cave with a monster they feared? So where did the bodies go? I cannot but feel that there is none as to prevent Tuvok from discovering the bodies so he can determine they died of a natural process and not by the hand of a monster. But given the way the clothes are arranged this must have given him that clue anyway. They did not die a violent death.What is truly bad about this series is that you see them try to make this tale work by bending everything out of shape. How truly convenient to the story that nobody was there to explain things to Tuvok. How interesting that there is apparently no guidance or buildings or anything to make the dying more convenient for the kids and tip Tuvok off? Why is it called dying anyway? How convenient that there is a storm around the moon that prevents everything from communications, teleporting to shuttle craft landing. And no Belanna tweaking the teleporter to teleport them out or in.The whole episode can only work if the story if things conveniently happen. Too much things. And this is why the episode truly is atrocious, despite an interesting premise and the acting.",2

They always seem to have just enough they think to find another planet with what they need.BUT what if they didn't? Would she let her crew die just to protect some idiot ""we cannot break their laws even if it costs us our lives""BULL.There was another episode where the people were just plain hostile and she was willing to sacrifice her crew instead of getting what was needed to keep them going and alive. SORRY but her first responsibility is to the crew and ship. IF need be you go in either in secret and just take what you need or if there is no other way, go in guns blazing, take what you need and split.This also brings up another question. (yes I know he show is 20 years old) BUT they keep running into other races and civilizations wherein they have all heard about the Voyager all over the Delta Quadrant.BUT no one has heard of the Federation which borders on the quad.This quadrant if we go by the numbers given as to the size of the Milky Way which is 120 thousand light years across. When they ended up on the far side of the Delta Quadrant that means they are about only 60 thousand light years from the edge of the Federation.BUT no one has heard of the federation? BUT they have heard of the Voyager no matter where they go?The Delta Quadrant is a very hostile quadrant. I mean seriously. Danger that would make everyone in the federation lose sleep. NO ONE is very friendly.Strange Quadrant. I would have suggested they erect a no fly zone that is heavily guarded for light year from the ""top"" of the Federation zone to the ""bottom"" of the zone from the edge of the galaxy to the center of the Milky Way.ANWAY, just thought I'd throw that into the rest of my review.The only bright spot is how they wrote Tuvok in his trying to handle what he thought were children.Otherwise not a very good episode with a pretty incredulous story arc.",

Returned is imagination, characters, and the Greek morality examinations of human existence that made Trek groundbreaking Science Fiction.Guest star Michael McKean delivers a highly entertaining performance, right up there with Frank Gorshwin, or Roger C. Carmel (Harry Mudd). He is the embodiment of Fear, and he delights in frightening his victims. And that delight is palpable.Kate Mulgrew also give possibly her strongest performance yet as Janeway, with almost a Kirk like swagger and demeanor, as against the odds, she cheats not death, but death's companion; fear. And she does it with Kirk's own confident, brash smile. Would Kirk bed her, or would she bed Kirk? A question we can only ponder.I started to have a criticism that the plot device of the interfaces was a little too Matrix-esque, until I realized this was years BEFORE The Matrix, and it could be said perhaps The Matrix stole from them? Harry and B'Lanna get ""jacked in"" way before Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus do. And their foe is much more entertaining.TOS fans, and Trek fans everywhere: rejoice! They got this one right, and they got it good.",9
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Thaw (TV Episode 1996)",Face to face with fear...,"When I first saw this back in the 90's I thought it was one of the creepiest things I'd ever seen! Firstly, I would like to talk about the Clown's Mardi Gras from Hell. Yes, the group of constantly prancing mimes(and other things)do look a little cheap and corny if you look right at them, but you're not supposed to. They're a backdrop, their only purpose is to set a certain dark mood and tone, which they do beautifully. The decapitation factor adds greatly to the horror aspect of the situation. I just can't imagine a worse thing to happen to somebody. Made no less scary I'd like to point out, by the fact that the guillotine is actually pink! Apparently even aliens are scared of clowns... I love Michael Mckean's performance, it just carries and makes this whole episode a great one. He's very loud and over the top without being too annoying or campy, all while still maintaining a sense of hidden depth. His costume is nothing like any traditional clown outfit, but the face-paint does a great job of conveying the all that. The personality of the character is that of a malicious, unstable, tantrum-throwing child. He brings to mind the bellowing Queen of Hearts from Alice in Wonderland. (off with their head?) I especially get a kick out of the character during one impressive scene of building terror where he is about to perform some unorthodox space-clown surgery on Harry Kim,(my personal most loathed of all Voyager characters) who seems to endure a ton of abuse in this episode. That poor baby must have been scared to death! I think they overdo the whole 'Mr.Fear' thing for a second, but I love what he says as he looms over Kim with the scalpel. It's very impressive, but to me it's scarier when it's more subtle. The moment is also notable for the first of several hilariously unexpected appearances by the Doctor, who completely changes the tone of the scene. I love how the Clowns listens to his advice for a second before reacting! The Doctor has some really great lines in this episode and watching him and the Clown just play off each other in their scenes is a delight! So, while the Clown is real toony and in some instances corny, he's still a very threatening and dangerous menace-one that surely needs to be ""conquered..."" ::: I love Captain Janeway in this one. She's really passionate in the scenes where she's stalking around and wrestling with the puzzle of how to outwit and appease what she considers to be literally fear itself. You can tell that Mulgrew was genuinely into the material. Next to the terrific performances of her and Mckean, the chief attraction of this episode for me is the ways in which it delves into the pathos and meaning of fear, and perhaps even the reason it exists. I think a good way to start to face what you're afraid of is to simply not close your eyes to it. Who could mistake the profound double meaning of when the Clown says. ""I'll always be here."" As a very rare treat, my favourite part is the ending. The entire episode builds up to it just perfect. Janeway's confrontation with the Clown and the way she tricks him into destroying himself is fantastic. The final seconds are just electric and so very poignant, with a suddenly very sad Clown facing oblivion with a cold uncaring representation of Janeway looking on. It's very dark, and could have been in danger of being a downer ending were it not for the wonderful little word the Clown mutters as he winks out of existence. Love that. ""Drat!"" Foiled! It brings back a little of the his joviality and lightens things up just enough. This is one of my all-time favourite Voyager eps and my very favourite of season 2. It's quite bizarre, but The Thaw is a great example of how acting, direction, a classic attention-grabbing hook and even an absurd villain can elevate a story to greatness. I wholeheartedly recommend it.",10

When people get all ticked off about something tht doesn't follow the same old ""us against the aliens"" plot, they send out their depth charges. This is far from a perfect episode but it is creative and thought provoking and sort of frightening. And I thought the ""Fear"" character was a stitch. I mean, you had to hate him. Of course, if you try to apply conventional criticism to this one, you aren't going to be happy. Just be happy that the next installment will probably be what you want.",9
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Thaw (TV Episode 1996)",Nothing To Fear,"""The Thaw"" is a great episode, wonderfully written, with a great guest performance from Michael McKean.A group of scientists is stuck in cryogenic stasis by the computer program designed to wake them up. It has gone rogue, and has trapped the scientists in a perpetual coma, terrorized by Fear, in order to keep itself alive.Fear is manifested in the character of The Clown, played by Michael McKean, who gives the episode just the right amount of dark theatricality. Roddenbury would have been proud.There are nice twists and turns around every corner, and the stasis program is wonderfully psychotic and surreal, reminiscent of TOS. This is a Trek classic that could sit on the shelf with the best of them. A home run.GRADE: A+",10
6,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Thaw (TV Episode 1996)",Trapped with Fear,"When Voyager approaches a planet that had been noted as a local trading centre they are surprised to find no sign of life, it turns out a solar flare nineteen years before had caused the planet to go into an ice age. As they get closer they trigger an automated message saying that some of the survivors are in stasis and should wake after fifteen years. As this time has past they beam the stasis pods back to Voyager and learn that the pods are linked in a way that puts the people in them into a shared artificial environment. There is no obvious reason for them to still be in there so Harry and B'Elanna enter the system using the pods of two people that died. Once inside they find themselves in a weird world that looks like some nightmarish circus ruled over by a strange clown who explains that this world was created from the minds of the people connected to it and those who tried to leave had been killed by frightening them so much that they have a hearty attack. The clown is a manifestation of the fear of those in the system, when told that Janeway will shut down the system even if it risks the people inside rather than leave them trapped he releases B'Elanna. As the Doctor isn't alive he is sent in to negotiate and one of the prisoners makes a suggestion that could disable the system, unfortunately the clown realises what is happening and kills him as a punishment. Eventually the Doctor makes an offer the clown can't refuse; free the hostages and take Captain Janeway in their place, of course she has a cunning plan.I wasn't that keen on this episode, the basic premise was good but the weird artificial world was just embarrassingly cheesy; it felt like something you'd see in late '70s sci-fi but not something made as recently as Voyager. The ending had a moral-of-the-week feel to it which wasn't the best way to end it, that is not to say the means of defeating the Clown was bad, just the final speech to him about defeating fear. While I wasn't keen on the episode I did think Michael McKean put in a good performance as the clown.",6
7,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Thaw (TV Episode 1996)",Star Trek: Voyager - The Thaw,"Michael McKean guest stars as ""fear"", dressed as this deranged alien clown, seemingly a creation stemming from the minds of aliens known as Kohl who decided to enter suspended animation pods until their world makes its way through a solar flare ecological catastrophe. The Kohl five (out of 400,000 people, tragically) were kept in hibernation by a computer which was supposed to wake them four years previously to when the Voyager arrives. To determine why these Kohl inhabitants weren't awakened Janeway and an away team beam down to the planet where the pods and central computer are located. Still in hibernation, Janeway opts to have officers, Kim and Torres, go under (two of the five are dead, having suffered heart attacks strangely) to see why the remaining three Kohl inhabitants weren't released from their pods. McKean's ""fear clown"", leader of this spirited carnivale, dancing and playing, lost in a delirium of madness and joy, informs Kim and Torres they will partake or else suffer the consequences. Kim, in fact, is bum-rushed and taken to a guillotine to be beheaded! It is only when a member of the Kohl three interrupts is this near-disaster diverted. Janeway being in control of the ""kill switch"" is reason enough for the clown to hold off killing Voyager officers. The clown wants to have access to brains so he and his virtual reality cohorts could continue to exist. The clown has the minds of the five hostage and will not release them unless others are subverted to the central computer in their place. McKean is the whole show here. He has this Star Trek mind fiction playground to go crazy, and his clown is quite an animated antagonist. He's obnoxious, unpredictable, juvenile, childish, sly, and ""protective of the mental turf provided to him by the computer"". It takes some serious creativity to outsmart this ""computer dysfunction"". The addition of Robert Picardo's artificial intelligent ship's Doctor trying to work as Janeway's negotiator and how McKean dismisses offers one after the other, calling bluffs and responding through threats is part of the episode's charm and story's suspense. How does Janeway and her officers trick the fear perpetrating the Kohl three and Kim (Torres is allowed to leave the pod when Kim warns the clown of the kill switch if she isn't allowed to talk with Janeway about how to rescue those ""mentally captured"") and get them out of the pods, no longer to be held captive by this computer manifestation? Part of the fun is seeing those in the stasis nightmare trying to figure the clown out but because the computer was designed to read from the thoughts of those in the pods during hibernation that makes strategy a bit more difficult. Only a delay in the computer from reading thoughts gives those in hibernation any chance at all to develop a plan. But McKean as the clown is the standout, just having a ball. As he fades, with Janeway's holographic image informing him of his defeat, the clown finishes by saying, ""Drat."" Kim under an assault through his fear while the clown enjoys it with great pleasure, aging him to elderly and infant states, with a near scalpel cut into him just averted is a highlight.",6
8,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Thaw (TV Episode 1996)",Avoid like the plague. Horrifically written attempt at horror,"The acting is good. The clown plays psycho control freak quite well. Janeway is strong and the doctor is his usual excellent self.However, the plot suffers from a hole big enough to drive a star ship through, we shouldn't care if anyone dies as heart failure should be easily handled by the doctor. Being scared to death should be of no consequence. People who have heart failure can be revived now, you'd think 300+ years of tech advancement and less than 1 minute between event and medical response would take care of it. We already know that Picard has an artificial heart, and Neelix survived with holographic lungs for a time. These folks would have revivable hearts. The goal should have been to kill them in the simulation and then revive them.The episode is settled in a clever way, but ends too abruptly. There should have been further info on what happened to the survivors. The planet was dead and only two survivors appeared to remain, unless the whole planet is full of more stasis pods. This episode should have ended with two new alien crew members.",2

The acting of Garret Wang when is is told to dance is just painful. Is he supposed to be scared, wondering what is going on, or enjoying it? Then there are the clowns? WHY? You could make a computer generated reality for a group of people in stasis anything, so make it creepy clowns. This episode is a terrifying acid trip gone horribly wrong. Truly an embarrassment to the Star Trek franchise.",1

However, the program adapts into a personification of the emotion of Fear, then entertains itself by tormenting the people for years.Boring! The fear/clown character is written so overboard as to suggest the writer has some issues. The whole episode is meant to only take up the 45-50 minutes of a weekly TV episode.Any race that was that far advanced in the first place would simply have placed people in those deep underground chambers in a cyrogenic stasis, with automatic revival after the short 20 year period of recovery needed by their planets biosphere.It would only have been a good nights sleep from their perspective.

Streamers, tacky costumes, overwrought movement, absurd fabrics, and gaudy face paint. A sort of interpretation of festival and carnival culture from people who don't quite understand it. This kind of exaggerated ""expressive"" performance comes up a few times across several series in the franchise; the ""Colony of Free Spirits"" on The Next Generation(The Higher, The Fewer!) for example. It was obvious to me as hammy, overacted, and seemed too childish to me when I was in kindergarten, and its an unwelcome addition to Star Trek as an adult. Performance and creativity are wonderful things, I don't want this review to come across as the bitter complaints of a sour old grouch who hates youthful expression and fun, but these performances are too tacky, gaudy, and annoying for me to sit through on most viewings. The process of overcoming the villain who generates this environment is satisfying, but only to see the over-the-top characters get their comeuppance.",1

0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Tuvix (TV Episode 1996)",Why Trek is Stellar,"This is a tale about a transporter incident in which the disparate bodies and minds of opposing characters Tuvok and Neelix are fused together into a third man whose name, and identity, becomes known as Tuvix.The fact that the result is truly a third man is the precise moral dilemma that this episode tackles. Should this third man supplant both Neelix and Tuvok? Or should he be removed in order to bring those men back to their own beings? These are tough questions and are typical of the moral dilemmas that the ""Star Trek"" franchise has always taken on for analysis.Writers Andrew Shepard Smith and Mark Greenberg create an episode deserving of an award with this ""Star Trek: Voyager"" morality play which examines some of the deepest and darkest elements of individuality, coexistence and morality. Not just the writers deserve credit for this excellent episode. The fabulous makeup department at Paramount creates an impressive physical juxtaposition of the characters Tuvok and Neelix. Further, veteran actor Tom Wright, with considerable assistance from director Cliff Bole and teleplay writer Kenneth Biller, takes viewers deeper into the characters of Neelix and Tuvok than either Tim Russ as Tuvok or Nathan Phillips as Neelix had yet been able to do. Tuvix becomes a popular man aboard Voyager, with his most memorable quote coming as he is besieged in the mess hall and asked on what authority he orders them all out: ""As Chief of Security or as Head Chef, take your pick! Out, out!"" Wright's interpretation of the material results in an absolutely stunning character, a true ""fusion"" of Neelix and Tuvok, and his aggressiveness in the role demonstrates not only his versatility as an actor, but an apparent deep understanding of ""Star Trek"" ideals.The ugly underside of this episode is its exploration of the death penalty. Tuvix exists for weeks as B'Ellanna and Kim and the rest of the engineers attempt to find a way to bring back Tuvok and Neelix separately. In the process, Tuvix ingratiates himself to many of the crew, including Neelix's squeeze, Kes. But the separate persons, Tuvok and Neelix, are not forgotten, and it is discovered that the only way for those men to be returned to Voyager is to essentially ""execute"" Tuvix. The unique ""Star Trek: Voyager"" mix of ingenious writers (both Greenberg and Smith are winners of daytime Emmy awards for their work on ""Jeopardy!""), producers (multiple award-winning ""Star Trek"" alumni Brannon Braga, Merri D. Howard and Peter Lauritson), director (Cliff Bole) and extraordinary actors all end up examining not just the morality of capital punishment, but its definition. Is Tuvix, as an individual, in being fully halved so as to revive the two individuals, Tuvok and Neelix, an innocent victim of the crew's desire for its familiar colleagues, or is the elimination of Tuvix worth those colleagues' return? Is it an execution? Does Janeway commit capital punishment? If so, why? Why aren't other solutions sought? Why isn't it simply accepted that Tuvok and Neelix are dead, but that they live, and quite illustriously so, within Tuvix? Tough questions, these. And the ""Star Trek"" franchise is famous for taking them on. The lovely and the ghastly: these are the domains of Gene Roddenberry's ""Star Trek."" Experience one of its finest incarnations in ""Star Trek: Voyager,"" and keep an eye out for one particularly provocative episode called ""Tuvix.""",10
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Tuvix (TV Episode 1996)",Wacky hijinks ensue when Neelix and Tuvok are joined to create Tuvix. But with a serious moral dilemma about taking unwilling lives at the expense of saving others.,"The episode started with a ridiculous premise. Neelix and Tuvok are combined in a transporter accident and we are treated to Tuvix. What seems like it will be an annoying abomination, a forgettable, unfunny episode with a typical ""and then nothing changes"" conclusion.But the ridiculous premise surprised me and went much further than I thought it would. Tuvix becomes an individual person through the several weeks the episode takes place. I likable one who is friends with most of the crew. So by the time a cure is discovered, Tuvix is a separate person from Neelix and Tuvok with his own will to live.Which is the lesser of two evils: to accept the deaths of Nelix and Tuvok to allow the life of Tuvix or to save those two lives at the cost of this new one? When did he become an individual with the right to life? Does he have the right to demand two deaths to pay for his life? Does Janeway have the right to save them by taking an unwilling life?""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."" Do these two lives outweigh the one? Spock would give his life to save many. Though many captains would risk the lives of their entire crew to save a handful of people. Worf saved the life of his wife at the cost of countless war casualties. When Sisko convinced the Romulans to join the war, which would save many of their lives, it cost the execution of some innocent Romulans. Now it's Janeway's turn.We all know how it will end because it would be stupid for Tuvix to be a main character for the rest of the show. But it's still heart wrenching to see the characters deal with their emotions and make the decision.If you think the captain made the right decision to sacrifice one unwilling life to save two, they make sure it's hard to go through. They evoke emotions that make sure you don't want it to happen, even if you think it's right. Just as the characters are going through.If you think she made the wrong choice, you see her struggle to choose, how much this choice hurts, how hard it is to do and to live with. Either way, she will punish herself for her choice. Between the two options, there is no right one. But she has to choose.",8
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Tuvix (TV Episode 1996)",Would Make a Great College Lesson!,"Tuvok and Neelix are one because of a transporter malfunction. The new character rising from the merging of their essences is called Tuvix. He becomes an autonomous, highly functioning creature, greater than the sum of his parts. But then a cure is found and he is to be separated. This, however, would result in the death of Tuvix. The conclusion of this episode becomes rather sickening. It would be like a man convicted of murder being found innocent but executed anyway. This gives us a lot to talk about.",9
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Tuvix (TV Episode 1996)",A transporter mishap converges two into one.,"Tuvok and Neelix, are on an away mission collecting plant life for the crew. Meanwhile the Voyager is experiencing some transporter malfunctions not knowing, that when used, it would materialize some unexpected results.

She misses her Neelix and finds the 'newer' version unsettling. Weeks pass and still they remain as one. Eventually the crew finds a way to separate the two conjoined souls. Kes wants her Neelix, and Tuvix wants to live. Tuvix does not deserve to die, but neither does Neelix and Tuvok. It is a hard choice that needs to be made.",
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Tuvix (TV Episode 1996)",The ultimate in irony....and Janeway gets to play god!,"Although you never hear Tuvok say aloud that he hates Neelix, his body language throughout the series clearly indicates that he can't stand the guy. As for Neelix, it's as if he goes out of his way to annoy Tuvok--so this episode is awfully ironic as well as funny.When the show begins, Neelix and Tuvok are on a planet and when they beam back, their DNA is scrambled and instead of one begin, they are now one! It's a hybrid that now calls itself Mr. Tuvix--and he's certainly like both of them. And, in my opinion, he's the best of both. The Doctor and other Voyager staff are stumped about how to change them back and repeated experiments fail. It looks like everyone will just have to get used to the new and much improved Tuvix! However, when a way to separate them finally is developed weeks later, Tuvix wants nothing to do with this--he wants to live. And, oddly, Janeway decides to play god and force a separation.This is a good episode, though I do wish they'd just had Tuvix remain as he was! Interesting and worth seeing.",7
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Tuvix (TV Episode 1996)",I thought this would be silly,"After all, it is called Tuvix, and involves a transporter accident, which stands for ""unbearably unscientific craziness"". And yes, it is an episode where Tuvoc and Neelix fuse together into a single humanoid, because of alien orchids. An eye-rolling premise - and at first, there is the fear that the episode is about how Tuvoc will through this experience learn to appreciate the annoying organism known as Neelix and vice versa.But, surprisingly, no. Not even close. The new Tuvix creature just settles in the ship, as the Doctor has trouble ""separating the two DNAs in order to restore Tuvoc and Neelix"". Mind you, this is the same Doctor who had no trouble turning humans who had turned into salamanders back into humans - but maybe everyone already pretends this never happened. Eventually, though, a solution is found, but Tuvix doesn't want it - he has a mind of his own, and to force the cure would kill him.I understand the (necessary for a series) resolution may leave some viewers unsettled and unsatisfied - I see some reviews disagreeing vehemently with the morality of the episode. As I see it, within context, there is no clear answer - you can't claim Tuvoc and Neelix are dead when there is a way to restore them. But that doesn't mean Captain Janeway's decision is correct. Again, within context, one might argue that ""transporter logs"" would allow everyone to remain alive (I thought so anyway). However, whether there is a plot hole, or whether the resolution offered is morally correct or not, is irrelevant here. Episodes like this one need not be judged on plot as much as on presenting a topic - and here, Voyager does so marvellously and in the best tradition of Star Trek. Asking difficult questions is the sign of good science fiction. And Tuvix, unexpectedly profound and helped by a great guest performance from Tom Wright, is just that.",9
6,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Tuvix (TV Episode 1996)",Star Trek: Voyager - Tuvix,"""So at what point, did he become an individual and not a transporter accident?"" - Captain Janeway.""Tuvix"" is one of the most troubling episodes I have ever watched within Star Trek. I don't think I will ever forget about it. When Janeway walks away after the separation of Tuvix, Kate Mulgrew's agony and emotional turmoil are so understandable and palpable, few would ever want to be trapped in that position. The Starship Captain has never been an easy role for anyone, and episodes like ""Tuvix"" are an example of why that is the case. After a transporter accident (a planet flourishes with floral and nutrient life) causes a type of ""symbiogenesis"" where orchid samples, Tuvok, and Neelix ""merge as one"", the end result is Tuvix, a hybrid lifeform! Picardi's Doctor attempts to work on the means to separate Tuvix and return Tuvok and Neelix to the Voyager.The problem that arises is that Tuvix, who has all of Tuvok and Neelix's thoughts and feelings, logic and playful spirit, wants to live as an individual being and not ""die"" (the separation would essentially kill him). What is Janeway to do? That is not an easy decision to make but Tuvok and Neelix have every right to live as Tuvixso do you kill Tuvix and bring back the other two? That moral dilemma (some consider what happens to Tuvix to ultimately be murder) at the heart of this episode (Tuvix, when told he may never be split back into Tuvok and Neelix, begins to make a life for himself, developing relationships and friendships, eventually accepted by almost all on the Voyager) doesn't have an easy answer. Regardless of what decision Janeway makes, there's loss. Neelix and Tuvok returning as separate individuals, seemingly unaware of what happened while they were merged, isn't a tragedy but what was lost because of the transport fix that rescued them is. A large part of that is the extraordinary performance by Tom Wright who does incorporate Russ and Phillips' personalities of their characters into Tuvixyou literally see both of them within a combination and yet Tuvix is still his own being. When Tuvix is begging for his life to those on the Bridge, it is gut-wrenching. So when Janeway walks away as Tuvok and Neelix show signs of exhilaration and relief, that aching and heartbreak on her face hits right at the gut.For me, one of my favorite scenes of the entire series occurs in this episode: Janeway and Kes have a discussion on those missing in their lives, for the Captain the loss of Mark and for Kes the loss of Neelix. I like seeing the vulnerable side of Janeway, this reflection on what getting lost in a different quadrant has done to her and the crew. She fights away tears and her embattled struggle to maintain her composure while hoping to console Kes is evident. Mulgrew really delivers a powerhouse in this episodeone of her finest hours.Despite a grueling, thought-provoking premise and highly controversial subject matter, the opening sequence with Tuvok and Neelix on the planet, surveying the grounds looking for specimens is a hoot. Neelix wants Tuvok to enjoy the experience of the rich landscape they occupy while his Vulcan logic doesn't permit such jovial excitement.This has been considered one of the most debatable and conflicting episodes of all of Star Trek. I think it certainly provokes a response one way or the other. Kes' dealing with this brand new lifeform who has feelings for her (he is Neelix, in a sense), and understanding that Tuvok has a family all his own is an intriguing development that further conveys the complexities of the plot.",7
7,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Tuvix (TV Episode 1996)",Perhaps the most amoral Trek episode of all-time,"I am giving this a 5 out of 10 because the concept was good and the Tuvix character was very interesting with good acting.However, Janeway and her crew decided to murder Tuvix. They were never brought to justice either. It's a very sick episode.This is another example of a fake moral dilemma that was solved in a completely amoral way. I mean fake because there was only one possible moral solution: let Tuvix live -- don't murder him!All of the rationalizations fail utterly. That no one seems to even see this is even more troubling.The episode where a Q commits suicide is also a mess, but for a different reason, by the way. In that episode, there was also a solution that didn't involve Janeway deciding someone should die. The solution was for Q to selectively forget his experiences which would have solved his problem. But, I guess the Voyager writers liked to kill people needlessly.I would also like to strenuously counter the euphemistic and absurdly inaccurate ""death penalty"" framing. There is no penalty for existing. Being born, however strangely, is not a crime!We're not talking about penalties. We're talking about cold-blooded murder.It may be inconvenient and emotionally unfortunate for Janeway and others to lose the separated Tuvok and Neelix, but that in no way can possibly justify murdering someone.Plus, the transporter was used to duplicate Riker so the intelligent and moral thing to do would have been to try to duplicate Tuvix and then separate the duplicate. Even that is murder technically, but it is vastly less serious -- particularly if the duplicate were to be immediately rendered unconscious so no new experiences were gathered to make the duplicate a separate person.The transporter is also a fountain of youth, but that's another Trek problem that's outside of the scope of this review.",5
8,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Tuvix (TV Episode 1996)",Fusion confusion,"I found the enigmatic and unique character of Tuvix utterly fascinating, having the calm logic of Tuvok but also the friendly and pleasant nature of Neelix. He retains the Vulcan's height and skin tone, but has the facial features of the Talaxian. The actor was no stranger to enduring heavy makeup for a role, I just loved him as the hitchhiker who could not die in Creepshow 2! He plays it like he's neither of the characters, yet somehow also both at the same time. There's a sense of both personalities. How can a person be two other persons and yet still be a different person? No idea! But the guy pulled it off brilliantly. His manner is almost childlike, he was a kind of newborn after all. I thought Tom Wright was simply excellent in the complex and rather demanding role put to him. I say demanding, because this particular guest star called for something much deeper than the usual alien trader or foe that slips in and out of the episode and never crosses the mind again. But to me, when you think of this episode you really remember Tuvix. Here was somebody who was wearing their uniform, and in the significant amount of time that passes within the story, becomes friend to some of the crew. Wright stated that he had felt a little tension from some of the regular cast members. I think that may have just been the natural reaction to the kind of character he was playing. It probably even helped his performance. I could have accepted Tuvix as a permanent member of the crew-the actor to me just does that great a job with the limited time available to him of conveying this poor unfortunate being who should never have been who ingratiates himself so very well into the crew! But there is also an air of wrongness and awkwardness about Tuvix. He's genuinely charming and competent, yet somehow never doesn't quite seem like a stranger and intruder. He never truly belongs. In any case, such a thought- provoking and challenging role must have been a daunting task for any actor, and Tom Wright did an amazing job. It's pretty much his performance alone that makes this episode a great and memorable one. I think if they had chosen someone wrong for the part, things could have turned out plain ridiculous. Fortunately that was not the case ::: Just what is the damn moral dilemma supposed to be? Tuvok and Neelix were there first, they didn't have a say in what happened to them, they had more of a right to exist than Tuvix. It's not as if they volunteered and then later on everyone changes their minds. I like the subtle little touches that are sneaked in that make you see Tuvix in a bit of a negative light, and not feel too bad when he is disposed of. Such as the way he throws himself at Kes even though she is clearly creeped out by him being anywhere near her. His slightly self-centred nature, the way he tries to convince Kes to put in a good word for him, and simply how much of a fuss he makes during the climactic scene. Not that you can blame him for wanting to live, but he's not even real! It's like, in Threshold, Janeway and Paris were transformed into salamanders, made sweet salamander love, and had cute little salamander babies! Was it ""wrong"" to restore them to humanity? Need every single decision on the show be so black and white, couldn't a mistake or two be made along the way? Sometimes there isn't a correct choice. Tuvix couldn't really be considered a real person because everything he was came from Tuvok and Neelix. He was never really born, and doesn't really die, just returns to where he came from, and lives on in their minds-like he said they would in his. The door swings both ways. One life isn't taken, two are restored. That said, the final scene that leads up to the diffusion is quite unpleasant. What I find most moving about it is the way he forgives them. The emotions are running high, and it's not until the reappearance of Tuvok and Neelix that all the tension disappears. And for what it's worth, you can clearly see how deeply disturbed Janeway is and probably would be for some time. Great story! To me the morality thing's a bit overrated but it's a real standout episode of the early seasons, and all in all a most excellent show.",9

Tuvix's arrival is most difficult for Kes who has lost both the man she loves and her closest confidante; it is made worse by the fact that he still has Neelix's feelings for her. It becomes clear that the accident wasn't due to a malfunction but due to the reproductive system of a flower they were transporting with them at the time of the accident. It appears that separating Tuvok and Neelix again may be impossible but after a few weeks a solution is found which causes a moral dilemma for the captain; does she force Tuvix to sacrifice himself to bring back the two lost crewmen or does she accept that they are lost to let Tuvix live.This was a really good episode even though it wasn't packed with action. I think they were right to get a different actor to play Tuvix rather than using Tim Russ or Ethan Phillips, Tom Wright, did a good job in the role, Jennifer Lien also puts in a fine performance as Kes as she has difficulty dealing with the fact that Tuvix is both the two people closest to her and neither of them. Even though Tuvix only existed for one episode there was sadness when he is forced to cease to exist so that Tuvok and Neelix can return in a scene where the Captain can barely look him in the face having decided what to do.",9
10,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Tuvix (TV Episode 1996)",Now that is what I want to see!,"After watching approximately two seasons of mundane, unintriguing episodes of Star Trek: Voyager I finally encounter an episode that I can unequivocally state is ""good"" Star Trek. Nominally Star Trek possesses at a minimum of three or four episodes within a season that possess philosophical concepts at a forefront in contrast to the background. However, Voyager's episodes have predominately possessed little to no fixation upon philosophy and consequently they did not warrant one to apply their mind to understand the consequences of what was to transpire. Yet in stark contrast to this trend I am jubilant to state that this episode is worthy of an individual's time to analyse for philosophies, propaganda, and characters dispositions. =SPOILERS=Philosophy and propaganda go hand in hand and such is most evident near the final act of the episode from the interval where Tuvix and Janeway discuss the matter of reversing the synthesis process and Tuvix's termination. The two philosophies present are pro individualism and pro collectivism, pro collectivism is endorsed by this episode and individualism is defeated. But because Star Trek is a conditioning tool for the public one should expect nothing less than an endorsement of the statuesque of our society, where the individual is always sacrificed to the uncaring collective. One truth that is ignored in the episode, that one should deliberate upon when observing the story, is that ""The only thing that one truly can control, is oneself."" But because Captain Janeway has a monopoly on violent force and a crew of willing drones that obey anything she says Tuvix's efforts to resist his sacrifice to the uncaring collective are fruitless and he subsequently yields and is terminated; thus conditioning those who passively accept all information they are shown, that they must yield to any collectives desires, and any attempt to resist the oppressive nature of collectivist organizations is hopeless (Like the Borg).Divergent from such things but remaining pertinent, this episode also reveals interesting truths about the various characters on voyager. One, all of the bridge crew at the time of Tuvix's outburst to resist his termination, are psychopaths or are so submissive that they have no ability to express an opinion in opposition of an oppressive collective's will. Such is demonstrated by the complete lack of empathy or remorse for the circumstance of Tuvix for absolutely no one attempts to concur with Tuvix, who is in the right. And so subsequently they then violate the individuals wishes and ignore another truth ""The most considerate individual for ones own circumstances, is oneself."" Yet Janeway the psychopath lies and pretends to act as a representative for two people who are terminated and synthesized into Tuvix, if anything Tuvix should represent the interests of Neelix Tuvok because he knows both of them better than anyone else, and as such the decision should be his. In addition, did anyone bother asking Tuvok and Neelix if their wish was to terminate Tuvix? No of course not, this is propaganda remember ;). Finally, another intriguing aspect of possible propaganda following the trend of counter intelligence is Tuvix himself, who is a generic synthesis of individuals, who is then destroyed by a collectivist organization in stark contrast to what most collectives would find most useful, generic people to use and dispose of at will.",9
11,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Tuvix (TV Episode 1996)",Who writes this garbage?,"** SPOILERS **""Tuvix"" is the worst episode ever made in the Star Trek franchise, in which Captain Janeway murders a new member of the crew in cold blood. The last two minutes is, literally, this character named Tuvix running away from the Captain, begging for his life from everybody in sight. Only the holographic doctor comes to his defense, but only for a few seconds until the Captain orders him aside.No, not a word in the above is inaccurate or even a slight exaggeration. How could this happen, you might ask? Let's start at the beginning. Tuvix is the name of a new character created from the accidental amalgamation of two crew members, Tuvok and Neelix. From the beginning of his life, Tuvix embodies the best qualities of the two aforementioned crew members: Neelix's innocent, empathetic and engaging nature, combined with Tuvok's sharp intellect and deep wisdom. Tuvix is a simply wonderful person. Or, was.Needless to say, from the beginning, the crew attempt to find a way to reverse the process which combined them. However, despite Tuvix's open and innocent nature, the rest of the crew can't help but be uncomfortably reminded of their former relationships with either Tuvok or Neelix. This is where the episode stopped being a rather intriguing story, and started a proverbial cliff-dive into the jagged rocks of cinematic disaster. Around 3/4 into the episode, there is a dialogue between Janeway and Chakotay where Janeway asks a question which is, apparently, intended to embody a moral dilemma: - - - - Janeway: It's funny - if we'd had the ability to separate Tuvok and Neelix the moment Tuvix came aboard I wouldn't have hesitated  but now, in the past few weeks, he's begun to make a life for himself on this ship. He's taken on responsibilities, made new friendsChakotay: I count myself as one of them.Janeway: So, at what point did he become an individual, and not a transporter accident? - - - -The answer is obvious, to anyone with a functional brain: he became an individual when he asserted himself as one. However, the writers of this episode were intent upon highlighting this question, as if it presented a genuine moral dilemma. No - a moral dilemma is where ANY answer you choose has negative repercussions. In this case, the negative repercussions of allowing Tuvix to live - i.e., the loss of Tuvok and Neelix - already happened. The only element still on the table is the other side of the coin, i.e. the death of Tuvix. So the real dilemma in this episode is this: either do nothing, and allow everyone currently alive to remain alive, OR: murder one individual in order to bring back two former crew members. Janeway chose the second option. Forget the Prime Directive, this was cold-blooded murder, plain and simple.",1
12,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Tuvix (TV Episode 1996)","Disappointing, Dark and Disturbing","When this episode began, I was quite intrigued by the notion of the two, very different characters of Tuvok and Neelix being merged into one. I anticipated the humor of Neelix facing off with the logic and discipline of Tuvok. However, instead of playing on these differences, the character of Tuvix, pulled both of them into a dark and disturbing place.The first hint of this was in Kes' reaction; instead of seeing that Neelix still existed within him, she was revolted by Tuvix. Although the merged character possessed some of the talents of both men, he lacked their honor and genuine ""goodness"". If Tuvix really had the feelings of Neelix; including his dedication to Kes; his top priority would have been to get Neelix back for her, whatever the cost! Mr. Tuvok's Vulcan instincts would have insisted that the benefits to the majority would outweigh the interests of a single individual. Instead, we find that Tuvix is cowardly and self-centered. How appalling! Making Katherine Hepburn (er... I mean Janeway) go through this ""death penalty"" scene is just adding more insult to the injury of these characters. She's not taking a life for heaven's sake, she's saving two of her crew members! Portraying the restoration of Tuvoc and Neelix as if there could be any other choice for the Captain is just bizarre! For the Doctor to oppose the procedure was also completely out of character for him. As we all know, Star Trek is all about the characters. Following so closely to episodes, ""Investigations"" (2.20), where Neelix's bravery and loyalty is showcased; and, ""Innocence"" (2.22), where Tuvoc's paternal love is so beautifully and tenderly apparent (whether he admits it to the children or not); the ""Tuvix"" episode (2.24), is a tragic disappointment.While nothing could be as bad as the ""last episode"" of Enterprise, ""Tuvix"" marks a low point in the Voyager series.",3

Yet another dark hypothetical is explored here, and we're treated to another overuse of the Doctor...his medi-babble to explain the event is downright infuriating.

It left me wanting to understand more. Why did Janeway do what she did? How did she justify it? Why did the crew take her side, even the most respected ones? What was the whole reaction to everyone involved? It leaves a lot of questions. To some, this episode may make you so ashamed of the entire voyager crew that you may not watch it anymore. If you are like me, this very well could be the final episode I watch (or the only one I will see again). This episode makes me question the morality of not only the Captain, but everyone single one on that ship, even Neelix and Tuvox (which didn't seem to object to what was done). If it were up to me, I would have been Pro-Choice about the matter (and I am Pro-Life). I am glad this subject was tackled, but I do not appreciate its one-sided ending.",3

As they can't leave the planet the Captain orders Tuvok to taker command of Voyager and continue the journey back to the Alpha Quadrant; she also specifically orders him to avoid risking contact with the Vidiians even though they might be able to help them. The captain is determined to find a cure until a storm destroys her equipment, then she must accept that they will probably have to spend the rest of their lives there, something Chakotay accepted much sooner. Back on Voyager things are not going so well. Several members of the crew, led by Ensign Kim, believe that Tuvok should ignore the captain's orders and risk contacting the Vidiians. Eventually after a talk with Kes he decides to contact them and after talking with the Vidiian doctor who had befriended Voyager's Doctor it looks like they have found a cure if they can be trusted.This was a decent episode with good performances from the central characters. I liked how Chakotay's story about a legend of his people turned out to be something he made up thus nicely inverting the cliché of his character having a legend for every occasion. I could have done without the friendly monkey whoever, I'm not sure what purpose it served. The story back on Voyager was perhaps more interesting as Kim's confrontational approach failed to sway Tuvok but Kes' more subtle approach persuaded him that something needed to be done as the crew's moral was suffering.",7

2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Resolutions (TV Episode 1996)",Pivot point for Voyager fans - Spoilers,"Probably the most talked about, most defining episode of Voyager -- at least for Janeway/Chakotay romance fans. And there are a lot of us. Many fans are so captivated by the ""love that never was"", that they've formed their own discussion and write vast quantities of fan fiction , devoted to ""JetC"", or J/C as it's called for short. There are many J/C videos online. One fan even wrote and sang a song for one (and she's good!)For me, Resolutions is a bittersweet moment in the Voyager saga. It's performed by two superb actors, Beltran and Mulgrew. They do a magnificent job of leading us through the narrative and convincing us that they are in love. The look on Chakotay's face when Janeway pulls away from his is amazing. Where's my box of tissues? The heartbreak is, that the Janeway/Chakotay romance was completely dropped. They hardly seemed to have any relationship at all. Instead, the powers that be (TPTB) gave us countless hours of treknobabble and entirely too many lifeless scenes where the ship was blowing up. They still used Janeway as a pivotal character, but Chakotay was often written as if he were an extra, spouting ""Red Alert"" and ""Shields at 20%"" or the unforgettable ""Shields at 60%"". Will we ever see drama of that caliber again? I HOPE NOT! In ""Resolutions"", Chakotay becomes Mrs. Janeway, cooking and making house on the Edenic planet on which they are stranded. He's deeply in love with her, but she wants to ""define parameters"" in their relationship (huh? Mine would be, take your vitamins, guy!). That line leads to a truly beautiful scene between the two characters. But, throughout the series, the Janeway character is forever saying she ""doesn't have time"" for romance and can't have the ""luxury"" of human love, and citing protocols and regulations that prohibit such a union. (that's not in original Trek!)She cannot have a normal relationship with a member of the crew. In later episodes, she has an affair with a hologram. Ugh! Oh brave new world! In the future, powerful women will be aloof and inhuman and will need to use an advanced computer projections in lieu of a normal, healthy relationship. Great! Glad I won't be there.It would have been a more powerful statement to have the two characters marry and run the ship as a ""Mom and Pop"". She could be pregnant and defending her ship and crew against Borg etc., still functioning in the real world and being in charge, the same way women in leadership positions do today.I do not know why TPTB got on this anti-J/C jag. If Janeway and Chakotay did the old ""impossible, it can never happen, arm's length"" mating dance that is common in Sci-Fi shows(Firefly, Farscape, X-Files) that would have been great, IF they eventually broke down those barriers and triumphed over...well, whatever it is that keeps them apart. Even if they just cared about each other, as friends and colleagues, that would have been terrific. But, to drop the relationship: not good. I guess we'll never know Berman's or Paramount's reasons for taking the show in that direction. I suspect there was spite involved, as the fans of the show were clamoring for J/C when the show was first run. Perhaps they did not want the fans to dictate the direction of the story. Robert Beltran, was not very politic in voicing his disappointment with the scripts he was being handed. Perhaps he angered the writers and the producers and they simply gave him less to do, which is awful for an actor. I know what he was complaining about, and he was right! But, that's all speculation on my part.Kirk and Spock were great friends, to the point of self sacrifice. Their relationship one of the main things that makes Star Trek TOS work so well. And, lack of it, is one of the things that mars this spin off, which is often a wonderful show.",10

Janeway orders Tuvok to take over command and continue to seek a return to Earth.A Vidiian convoy is known to be in the area and the suggestion is made that they contact them to see if they can help...huh????! The Vidiians tend to look at other species as spare parts for them to consume to stay alive. They are not exactly known for their philanthropy.When Tuvok dutifully follows Janeway's orders to leave, Ensign Kim decides that they should contact the Vidiians. Him and the others rightfully say that Tuvok does not know what they are feeling...they are sad! Well, everyone probably is sad, but the logical (and I would certainly agree)thing to do is follow Janeway's last order as Tuvok does.Kim then openly seeks out the opinions of everyone/anyone who will listen to him...can anyone say 'conspiracy to mutiny'? Fairly unbelievable for a military ship, to put it mildly.Luckily Chakotay and Janeway don't get intimate (they are supposed to have been on the planet for some time; don't you think if you knew you were the last two on a planet...)because the episode later has Tuvok change his mind and they go back to talk to the Vidiians who agree to help them as they just happen to have a cure for the disease.

And, since the pair cannot leave the planet and they would infect the crew, the ship is instructed to leave and Tuvok is the new Captain. However, following this, the crew is bummed and, inexplicably, Harry Kim becomes uncharacteristically disrespectful towards Captain Tuvok. Eventually, however, Tuvok changes his resolve and tries to do something the Captain didn't want him to do--to contact the Vidiians to see if they know of a cure. So is this any good? Well, not especially.

I personally didn't like Jeri Ryan's character because they too easily went down the path of bringing in the statuesque eye candy blonde when they could have focused on working Janeway's battle between work and love, like so many real strong career women do.... and figured a way to show how it worked.. while continuing to build character development and threading it all together.",7

It isn't that I necessarily demanded a Janeway / Chakotay love affair, but if the story begs and pleads for it—and the chemistry is undeniable—why not give us some satisfactory result? What we get is Janeway achingly accepting it is time to leave (Mulgrew once again just knocking it out of the park with her touching performance) ""New Earth"" (Eden?), assuming her Captain's chair, with Chakotay right beside her, both looking forward as if never acknowledging what just happened between them on the planet! The story is a really big deal that doesn't quite reach its potential, I thought. It involved Janeway and Chakotay stuck on a lush, green planet, a virus without a cure plaguing both of them due to a particular insect bite. The Voyager adversary, the Vidiians, might have knowledge of a cure but that would be dangerous to attempt, as newly positioned Captain, Tuvok, wisely accepts at Janeway's command once giving over her rank to him. But Ensign Kim is unyielding in loyalties to the two senior officers, persistent in his desire (and others on the ship) to help them in whatever way they can. Tuvok and Kim are at odds over this, with the new Captain warning him of any potential insubordination. Vidiian ally, Danara Pel (Susan Diol), has a cure but Tuvok is still leery about her species' willingness to help the Voyager considering the unease between both parties. The risk is against Tuvok's logic, his understanding of how low the crew morale is taken under advisement, but the Voyager decides to meet Pel's Vidiian ship at particular coordinates, sure enough encountering an ambush.While on the New Earth, Janeway tries to come up with a cure herself while Chakotay cooks, builds, and accepts that they might have to remain on the planet. A storm causes damage to equipment which deters Janeway's efforts. Eventually she resigns to a new life, and possible romance looms. However, Janeway resists what her heart obviously feels. There includes a terrific scene where Chakotay communicates to Janeway his feelings through a made-up story regarding a warrior and the lady warrior he serves alongside in order to find and sustain inner peace. There is some really good acting between Bertran and Mulgrew that certainly didn't go unnoticed by me. It is the show's writing department that failed to capitalize on the obvious.I agree with others critical of this episode regarding its implied passage of time not quite succeeding. It just doesn't feel like months have gone by. It is just the way this show is paced. Still, I don't dismiss the effort. And it was cool to see Tuvok in the position of Captain much like Spock was during the original series, battling the heightened, emotional states of those who questioned his logical approach to being in charge.",6

And, the Kazon Nistrum(?) story.Many things are happening at once - Paris leaves Voyager and joins a ship of Neelix's People, a Kazon in a Kazon shuttle is ""saved"" by Voyager, and even Ensign Sudor (Brad Dourif) - Who is still locked in his room as punishment for killing a crewman and enjoying it too much.Voyagers Kazon ""Guest"" suggests to them a path they could take to escape from a huge gathering of Nistrum ships. But this is a trick, the question always is, ""If it's a trick, why is it being done?"" - Little attacks by smaller Kazon ships focus on one particular section of the ship - One which if hit too much, would cause the secondary command processors to fail.But the little ships can't cause that much damage - The damage has to be done from Inside, therefore the Kazon Guest blows himself into tiny molecular chunks, and finishes the Job- Taking All of Voyager's BrainGel packs offline.Seska (Martha Hackett who is always a great Romulan or Klingon) has been teaching the Kazon some Cardassian Tricks, this was a worthy adversary for Season 1-2. We know from DS9's ""Garak"" and ""Dukat"" that Cardassians have eidetic memory. So while Seska was still alive, Voyager had little chance of getting out of the Delta Quadrant. Obviously, this has to be dealt with in some way.But Seska herself has taught Janeway how to be devious - And Paris was part of this deviousness. It was set up so he would be captured by Seska and ""First Maje Culluh"" of the Kazon Nistrum in an earlier episode, in fact it was so that he could find out what they were up to and then make contact with Neelix's people for support.So - Paris barely gets away from the Kazon, but the Kazon have stopped Voyager dead in it's tracks - And they drop off the entire Voyager Crew onto a Volcanic World populated by Neanderthal Native Americans.Every Voyager crewman but two: The Doctor, and Ensign Sudor. But we know that Sudor is capable of spanking the Kazon- If he could be talked into Killing, once again. But he wanted to ""Do Something for The Ship"" - This is his chance.",10
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Basics: Part I (TV Episode 1996)",Entertaining Certainly/But Some Really Bad Judgment for People With Their Abilities,"Chikotay becomes the fulcrum in this final episode of Season Two. Once again, Ceska, one of the biggest rats in any setting, pretends she is in grave danger, showing Chikotay ""his son."" He is not his son. He is a product of deception and is used to play on human sympathies and good will. When that Kazon guy comes on board, it should have been obvious that there was something up. Funny, the Doctor didn't notice his planted device. I am tired of the Native American stuff and the literal appearance of spirits on demand. I think this is a bit insulting. Did anyone notice how the father didn't let his son tell him a few more details. Did anyone ever weigh the value of the entire crew over Chikotay's forced paternal being? But all the foolishness of Janeway and the rest, we are left with a cliffhanger going into Season Three. The crew is on a prehistoric planet. By the way. Why did the Kazon not just kill everyone? They would have eliminated a lot of trouble. They are a bloodthirsty lot and it would have been in character.",9
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Caretaker (TV Episode 1995)",A really good pilot episode,"Voyager's pilot episode is just as great and gripping as The Next Generation's pilot Encounter at Farpoint, but the Caretaker earns an extra brownie point because it establishes each character's basic traits clearly to the viewers. When all the principal characters' crossed paths at the Ocampan underground tunnel, you really feel that the show is really off to a great start on creating an ensemble show (well until Seven of Nine comes in halfway in season four, then the show becomes a rather one-sided affair). Bon Voyage, it has been a great seven seasons and all of its characters will be sorely missed.",10
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Caretaker (TV Episode 1995)",A great beginning to a long journey.,"""Caretaker: Part 1"" - This episode starts with a Maquis (a group of rebels) ship fleeing from Cardassians into the Bad Lands. Shortly after entering the Bad Lands, there is a flash of light.A week later the Voyager is on a mission to find them as one of the people on the Maquis ship was the Voyager's Security Chief, whom was undercover.Once they get to the Bad Lands they experience the same conditions as the Maquis ship. The ship gets damaged, killing the first officer and the doctors, leaving them only with the EMH (Emergency Medical Hologram) for treatment. Not only that but they also find that they have been sent into the Delta Quadrant, 70,000 light years from the federation and are right next to the Maquis ship.Everyone from both ships gets teleported to the array without warning. It would appear that is what brought them there. It isn't long before they are greeted by an old woman and her neighbors.But who are these people? And what do they intend to do with their guests?",9
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Caretaker (TV Episode 1995)",A good introduction to the series,"This feature length episode serves well to introduce the regular characters that will feature in the series and to set up the situation they find themselves in. In the opening scene a Maquis ship is chased into the Badlands by the Cardassians and find themselves caught in a wave that throws them across the galaxy. One of the people on that ship was an undercover Star Fleet officer so a ship is dispatched to the Badlands to find him; that ship is the USS Voyager. We are quickly introduced to the crew we will be spending the next seven years with: Captain Catherine Janeway, Tom Paris a pilot currently in prison and Harry Kim, an ensign on his first mission. Soon after getting to the Badlands Voyager also finds itself flung across the galaxy to the Delta Quadrant. Several crew members are killed in the process this of course leaves several key positions unfilled so when they are forced to join forces with the Maquis there are important positions for them to fill and as the Doctor was killed we get to see Star Trek's first major character who is a hologram. After a visit to the array that brought them to the Delta Quadrant one member of each crew is kidnapped and transported to a nearby planet. In order to get them back they get help from local trader Neelix and Kes. As well as making two new friends in the Quadrant they also make an enemy of the Kazon, the species that appears to control that area of space.This episode was a good opener as it successfully introduced a full cast of characters, obviously it will take more episodes to really get to know them but this was a good start. It also showed that even though they were on the other side of the galaxy they wouldn't allow harm to come to others to help them get home. While a lot of time is spent introducing the characters there is still plenty of action including a tense scene where the crew attempt to escape from the Ocampa's underground city though tunnels where the stairways are starting to collapse due to an earthquake and a space battle with the Kazon to prevent them gaining control of the array.",8
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Caretaker (TV Episode 1995)",This show is a winner!,"I have been a casual fan of all of the Star Trek incarnations. While I remember fondly the highly innovative and ground-breaking first Star Trek, I never re-watch that series mostly because I didn't care for William Shatner's portrayal nor for the show's (general) portrayal of women – and oh, those stupid uniforms! So to hear that a new Star Trek series was to have a woman captain was intriguing – I am pleased that Kate Mulgrew so well pulled it off. The pilot episode clearly establishes the characters and I like the cultural and ethnic diversity of the combined crew. This episode was a good start to a strong television series. One side note – in the scene where Captain Janeway tells the Caretaker that he should let the Ocampa take care of themselves etc., I was immediately reminded of Captain James T. Kirk who also expounded on the necessity and virtue of self-reliance when talking about a people who were being ""taken care of.""",8
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Caretaker (TV Episode 1995)",Good Start to a great Star Trek series!,"After watching this episode of Star Trek Voyager I knew that this series of Star Trek would be one of the best. In this episode (the pilot) all the main characters are introduced. Kate Mulgrew plays a convincing role as Captain Janeway who is generally nice but when it is needed, which it mostly is, Janeway can also be a real bad-ass! The other characters have their good points and their bad points, Chekotay has his general knowledge of the outdoors and how to get in touch with his spirit guide. Tom Paris has his knowledge of 20th century history and Harry Kim has the knowledge of music (what good that will do on a star ship 75,000 lightyears from home we dont know). Tuvok being a vulcan the most knowledgeable species of them all has knowledge of well everything, constantly offering the logical way out to the rest off his crew. B'Ellana has knowledge of enginnering and is able to always have good suggestions on how to keep the ship in ship shape!! The Doctor or EMH has knowledge of medicine and how to treat anything from a stubbed toe or acute stomach pain from Mr Neelix's cooking! (One of the many jokes from Voyager's EMH). Neelix has knowledge of cooking and how to make lettuce in to a decent meal. Kes well she knows a bit of everything and is always willing to learn! Lets not forget the computer voice who has been with the Voyager crew through thick and thin always willing to answer their questions no matter how stupid or annoying they can be. So basically watch this series its full of fun and enjoyment!",

Captain Janeway loses medical personnel and key members of her Bridge crew. Her chief security officer, Vulcan Tuvok, has been undercover on a ship operated by the Maquis, quasi-Federation / anti-Cardassian group also lost in the Delta Quadrant. In charge of the Maquis vessel is Native American Chakotay and half-human / half-Klingon engineer specialist, B'Elanna Torres. Caretaker is an alien lifeform that protects a species of highly intelligent telepaths known as the Ocampas. A member of the Ocampas is Kes, the beloved of a Taxon named Neelix, who has a vast knowledge of the Delta Quadrant, both wanting to be a part of the Voyager crew's journey to find home. Caretaker is dying, and its ability to send the Voyager back is not an option due to its weakening state. Meanwhile a threat to the Ocampas called the Kazon want the array for their own use, with Caretaker begging Janeway to not allow it. Chakotay might just help in that regard. Included is a desert planet with an underground civilization where the peaceful Ocampas thrive as the Kazon survive above on the unbearable surface where it is hot and water-deprived. Taken from the Maquis is Torres and Ensign Kim from the Voyager, by Caretaker, sent to the Ocampas with Janeway, her ""reclamation project (pilot Tom Paris), Neelix, Kes, and Chakotay on a rescue mission to retrieve them. Ultimately this brings members of the Maquis and Starfleet together, even if it will be a bit rocky at the beginning. Paris was responsible for an accident that killed three officers and was temporarily a member of the Maquis...he has a bad rep for only looking out for himself, later proving this to be not altogether true when he saves Chakotay from certain death and volunteers to find Kim on the rescue mission. Torres admits to being in Starfleet to Kim, and her Klingon side produces an aggressiveness and seething anger she has trouble controlling. There is some early Neelix / Tuvok fun when the Taxon gets a nice bath as the Vulcan meets him in his quarters, quite annoyed as logic is tested by spirited glee.",7

This pilot episode sets everything up. We are introduced to all the principle characters (more, of course, will be added later). We see why they are in the predicament they are in. We internal combustion but Janeway is a decent hub in the wheel. I can't believe 23 years have passed since this show first appeared. I'm going to wade my way through it one more time.",8
7,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Caretaker (TV Episode 1995)","Decent but like so many pilots, it has its teething pains","This is a two-part pilot episode to introduce this new Star Trek series. And, to pass on the baton, so to speak, the show begins on Deep Space 9.It's difficult to judge any series based on its pilot episode. The show spends a lot of time introducing characters, dumping LOTS of back story onto the audience as well as forming the characters. As a result, the folks on this particular episode are a bit wooden and difficult to believe. For example, Mr. Neelix is much, much more talkative and annoying in this one--and fortunately, over time the show smoothed these rough edges. As for the plot, it's only okay. The show begins with the Maquis and Federation battling each other. But, due to a strange array on the opposite side of the galaxy, they are pulled many thousand light- years away. Now both a Maquis and Federation ship must work together to somehow try to make it back home. Why they were brought there and how they'll get back is pretty much the focus of the show- -as well as the series.",5
8,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Caretaker (TV Episode 1995)",It certainly went on from this.,"Voyager has always been my favourite TV series from the franchise, maybe it's the nostalgia from College days, but this one truly hit the spot.I hadn't seen the pilot since it first went out, it's a good, solid start to the show, it sets the scene, introduces the characters and gives a flavour of what's to come. In some ways it's a little raw, and some of the special effects are a little crude by today's standards, but this is approaching 25 years old, so you could argue it holds up well.Some nice scenes, including some rather creepy and strange villagers, it of course introduces the fabulous Captain Janeway. It did its job and got me hooked on the series, so a solid 7/10, great episodes would follow.",7
9,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Caretaker (TV Episode 1995)",It could only get better!!!,"As a pilot, Caretaker works reasonably well. Each new character is introduced adequately and also familar settings and characters are thrown in to support the plot.Introducing the Kazon's was always going to be a bad move. However, the Neelix/Kes relationship was strong from the very start, and Mulgrew convinces as a new captain.As he does throughout the series, the Doctor provided the humour elements which have become a trademark of ST: Voyager over the years. Its a shame Chakotay had to replace the demised 1st officer as he looked just right for the part.Caretaker does not however grip you like the pilots for the other three Trek series', and although I think as a whole ST: Voyager outshines the lot of them put together, this TV movie demonstrates how they had to scrape away the mud before reaching the gold.",
10,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Caretaker (TV Episode 1995)",Best First Episode of all the Star Treks to Date,"This, without a doubt, is the best first episode of all of the Star Trek series.Not only do we get an introduction to all the major characters, we get a ""template"" for captain to crew relations that carries through the entire series. Janeway is unique in that she is not only a tough captain, she can also be emotionally available to crew concerns. This even extends to the doctor, who she initially views as ""just a machine.""Though the alien entity that drags them into the Delta Quadrant is largely benign, it""s looming end limits what it is willing to do for the other lifeforms it has highjacked. There is also a hint of just how many species it has stranded in that quadrant, when Voyager discovers Neelix.Though there are some weak episodes in the seven season series, the writing, production values, and direction are solid.",9
11,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Caretaker (TV Episode 1995)",Good Pilot - 'She's dead Jim... I mean Neelix',"This is a pretty good episode. Part I especially has some theatrical qualities; although I'm pretty sure it was unintentional. I really want to talk about a couple of inconsistencies that bother me about Voyager. For one thing, the death of Stasi (?) the Betazed helmsman and other 'minor' characters throughout the series. Tom Paris just bends over her and says 'she's dead' and that's it - if this was a regular character, they wouldn't ever just stop there... they would build some 'bio- temporal' chamber or freeze the body until they can repair them, they would never just say, oh well 'Captain Janeway's dead'. The worst offense was in 'Random Thoughts' - The old lady had just stabbed the woman Neelix was talking to, and 'oh, she's dead' excuse me, but her stabbing was far from the EMH's abilities to heal, they could've beamed her to sickbay and she could have been healed, but they needed a death I suppose. Kes sucks - she's too goody-goody, the best thing the show ever did was exchange her for Seven of Nine. Neelix is a very weak character also IMO. I hate everything about Kes, her hair, everything... they should have changed her hair sooner... although she was good in 'Before and After'. Giving Paris the chance to 'prove himself' by saving Chakotay was contrived and derivative. Although saying derivative is now derivative. G. Wang is a poor/average actor... he was decent in 'Timeless' (a personal fav.) - but his comedic timing and delivery is non-existent. I cringe whenever I hear him make a joke - 'What makes you think were friends' and of course, the worst: 'Turkey Platter'... jeezus.",7
12,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Caretaker (TV Episode 1995)",OK... Could have been better...,Nice concept. Oversimplified. Good characters.  It was OK but didn't live up to the Trek legend.Need I say more?,5
13,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Caretaker (TV Episode 1995)",Wonderful start to a bad series,"Caretaker was really great, but as many other Trekkers will note, Voyager went way downhill from here. With the Next Generation in the movies and DS9 not exploring space, the pilot for Voyager takes audiences where they have never gone before. The story is interesting and way above in the quality department then most of the Voyager episodes. There is good acting too. Sadly, Voyager does go down from here and loses it's creativity.",

Chakotay has other ideas however and recommends that B'Elanna should be given the job. When Voyager finds itself caught on the event horizon of a black hole it calls for radical ideas and B'Elanna's successful ideas lead to her being given the job despite objections from some of the Star Fleet crew.This episode lacks the excitement of the series opener but features good character development for B'Elanna, we also see the beginning of Kes's friendship with the Doctor when she asks for his help in setting up a hydroponics bay and unlike everybody else she treats him like a real person.",7
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Parallax (TV Episode 1995)",Good Action and Necessary Character Development,"I'm afraid that my lack of scientific knowledge leaves me a bit confused by the various spacial obstructions encountered by these starships. In this one, there is an anomaly that has to do with the time/space continuum. It presents a formidable obstacle for the a ship that has just found its way out of a previous engagement. The focus here, however, is the role of chief engineer being coveted by Torres, who lets her emotions get the best of her at times. The episode starts with her breaking the nose of the current chief of engineering. This is a well constructed episode, demanding that Voyager be used as a battering ram. Good human encounters, but it is still pretty preachy. Like Kirk in he original, we often pause and listen to the Captain deliver something pithy.",8
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Parallax (TV Episode 1995)",Good but certainly not subtle,"Early on in the series, Lt. Torres sure looks like a much angrier version of Tasha Yar. She was so angry that the character seemed a bit ridiculous--and this is all part of the teething process in introducing her character. She certainly is not subtle in this particular show! This affects the overall quality of the show as does the fact that there are no aliens in this episode--just a 'quantum whatchamacallit' and a mirror image Voyager. Kind of dull stuff compared to other episodes, though I did have a laugh watching the Captain and her reactions to Torres. All in all, not a bad episode at all and it shows promise--but also one that is a bit tough to love.",6
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Parallax (TV Episode 1995)",good show in spite of B'Elanna's premature promotion,"The characters Kes and B'Elanna are further developed in this second Voyager episode. ""I have a huge chip on my shoulder and I hope it annoys you"" B'Elanna Torres breaks the nose of the senior officer Carey in the engineering department.; nonetheless Chakotay tries to convince Captain Janeway that Torres is the best choice for Chief Engineer. Given that we know that she will be the ongoing series character and not Lieutenant Carey, it's not too hard to figure out who will become Chief Engineer as implausible as that is. She is clearly the more brilliant engineer but her little leadership speech (""I hope I can count on you"") to Lt. Carey at the end of the show sounds insincere and unconvincing. The Ocampan Kes befriends the doctor and is, as intended, a very likable character who nicely offsets the B'Elanna character. The Voyager is in danger of being sucked into a collapsing star. This is where B'Elanna shows off her engineering brilliance and comes up with a solution to their predicament. I particularly liked the discussion between Captain Janeway and B'Elanna regarding whether the mirror image was on the port side or starboard. A solid, if flawed, entry in the series.",6
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Parallax (TV Episode 1995)",Star Trek: Voyager - Parallax,"After the season pilot for ""Voyager"", the show set out to build the characters, using odd space anomalies among other black holes, quantum abnormalities, and nebula as McGuffens, backdrop dangers to further tell stories on adapting to being ""lost in a mysterious quadrant"". In the second episode, Thomas Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill) proves his mettle as a ""pilot"" while B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) has trouble taking orders in Engineering while her former Maquis commander, Chakotay (Robert Beltran), works to promote her to the chief if Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) will approve. Tension is high as those who served under Chakotay for the Maquis tell him privately they would support him in a mutiny if he so chooses. Chakotay, though, wants the Maquis officers and Starfleet officers to acclimate themselves into a cohesive uniteasier said than done. However, this whole event horizon situation where the Voyager is unable to escape a quantum singularity (a type of black hole) could be Torres' chance to prove herself as a worthy candidate for the Chief Engineering position. Janeway challenges Chakotay, to see all officers under command and him functioning as her proper second, without playing favorites. So the show was still clear on its flawed characters and indifference among the crew, as Torres has her share of problems with the Federation officers, particular senior officer, Carey (Josh Clark), who she punches in the face during a disagreement! Janeway and Chakotay were still at odds although there was real respect shared between them, and the captain is willing to listen to her second in command with suggestions. Neelix and Kes prove to be valuable additions to the crew, as the former knows the quadrant quite well and the latter has a brilliant mind offering suggestions on organic food production due to a lack of energy resources. The ship's holographic medical doctor, which is activated or deactivated when needed in Sickbay, played by Robert Picardi, suffers from ""shrinking"" and has requested assistance (but his condition is consider of less importance because of the quantum singularity). There is a brief exchange between Picardi and Kes (Jennifer Lien) that will become a nice friendship that develops. The shuttlecraft trip to the ""crack"" of the singularity, hoping to open it and escape, with Janeway and Torres, allows them to come to a place of understandingthe conclusion has the two of them having to figure out which Voyager (the singularity produces two Voyagers, with one a basic ""time delay"" duplicate of the other) is the right one to board! The science of the show can be a bit confusing and challenging (I often have to research the meanings behind the space and time complications facing the Voyager just so I can leave each episode not completely mentally overloaded!), but the characters are quite compelling, and the Voyager's dilemma in the Delta Quadrant trying to return to the Alpha Quadrant produces plenty of unpredictable journeys/missions. This episode does continue to establish the unease that exists on the ship between the Starfleet and Maquis...how it is a work in progress. As Captain of the Voyager, Janeway shows that she's willing to listen and her patience, exuberant passion when answers come that might resolve crises, and ability to command despite impending obstacles (think about the constant problems that exist in being away from the Federation...) are commendable attributes.",6
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Time and Again (TV Episode 1995)",A Great Early Episode,"This is a great early episode of Voyager. Several elements made me think of the original Star Trek with the Captain leading the away team and a Vulcan officer leading the rescue team. Some of the clothes worn on the planet look like they came from the 60's as well. There is also some Next Generation influence with the empathic female Kes discovering her expanded mental abilities.The actors have settled into their characters after the pilot and the story is well-written. The crew finds a planet that has recently destroyed itself due to a huge energy explosion. When visiting the surface Captain Janeway and Lt. Paris end up trapped 2 days in the planets past, just before the explosion. Should they try and stop the incident that leads to the explosion, and can the Voyager crew find a way to rescue them?

1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Time and Again (TV Episode 1995)",An early paradox,"The first episode of this series introduced the characters, the second showed the two crews starting to integrate and this one is the first to fully concentrate on an adventure. Passing through a star system Voyager detects a wave caused by a polaric explosion. When they investigate they discover a completely dead planet, its population completely eliminated by the explosion. As the wave hits Voyager Kes wakes as if from a nightmare, deeply effected by the deaths on the planet. On the surface Tom suddenly sees the city as it was before with everybody alive. Realising that the area is full of time fractures the away team attempt to beam back to the ship; Tom and the captain don't go back though, instead they find themselves on a crowded city street a day before the deadly explosion. Not wanting to break the prime directive they must find away to contact Voyager but can't tell the locals what is about to happen... that is until they believe their presence may have caused it when a group of protesters decide to move the time of their action against the plant because they think Janeway and Tom are government agents. This suggests their presence may have had some effect on the tragedy. Meanwhile back on Voyager the crew are trying to find a way to open one of the fractures to perform a rescue.This was a great early episode where the captain is left with a dilemma as to whether or not she should interfere to save a civilisation, ironically it turns out the disaster wouldn't have happened if the two Voyager crew members hadn't needed rescuing. This episode also sees the first use of the ""Voyager reset button"" where crew actions mean that nothing we've seen actually happens and the ship carries on as if nothing happened.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Time and Again (TV Episode 1995)","When a planet blows up, don't visit it the day before","I hear a lot of complaints about time stories. I'm tired of seeing them actually, cos lots of shows have dealt with aspects of time. Quantum Leap, Time Trax, Time Tunnel, Voyagers. But Trek is the proper place to have stores about time.But this episode is more or less about an aspect of Kes' abilities. To tell us about it, there has to be a story ""that never happened"". This is probably the first Voyager episode where the whole crew is acting like a crew.As far as the conundrum used, it surprised me. This is also one of the first Voyager Planet Based Eps, and Tom Paris and Janeway get caught up in a planet's politics.Some new energy source was created by Andre Bormanis, with brand new backward-flowing Time Radiation. So that's how this story is told. How to get the Principles into the Past? We've seen all kinds of gimmicks in Trek, a malfunctioning Romulan Cloaking Device, a Neutron Star, a Regular Star, a bad Injector on a Runabout Nacelle, and even a good Ole Bajoran ""Orb of Time"" But here, we basically have holes in the continuum, which Paris gets sucked into. The thing we get shown is that Tom Paris, faulty as he is, is good with Children, even one he scares the Bejesus out of by ""appearing out of nowhere""- And he is not above risking himself to save someone. And we get reminded that Janeway is a scientist. Picard was the Diplomat, Kirk used Fisticuffs, The Sisko had The Prophets. Here, we have Janeway's scientific Method, and probably the best 1st Season example of it in action.The question is, how to get what Janeway figures out 24 hours into the Future? If it can't be done, it's ""Future's End"" once again.This was my favorite 1st Season Voyager Offering. It is a cyclic episode, exploring Time's circular Arrow. As O'Brien would say: ""I Hate Temporal Mechanics!"" Here, we have Kes in the Future working with Janeway in the past to find the solution, and the payoff is, they do not have to get vaporized, and Voyager gets to continue on hiding from the Kazon Nistrum and Oogla and Viidians until season 3 or so.",10
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Time and Again (TV Episode 1995)",Adventure through a time fracture,"This episode revolves around the fascinating concept of impacting and/or changing the past. A Voyager away team is exploring a planet whose entire civilization has been wiped out by a polaric explosion. Janeway and Paris slip through a time fissure and go back to the day before the polaric explosion occurred. They are captured by activists who strongly oppose the use of polaric energy (quite rightly as it turns out) and believe that Paris and Janeway are government spies. The best thing about this episode is the concept – the whole issue of ""can the past be changed?"" is an ever-interesting one. The execution of this concept is pretty good even though also somewhat unsatisfying – has history been changed or only postponed? Interesting. The worse thing about the episode was the costumes. One reviewer said it reminded him of costumes from the sixties for the original Star Trek show. So true. And clothes/costumes from the sixties were so ugly. This is an enjoyable adventure episode but not much in the way of character development.",6

It seems that somehow the arrival of the Voyager led to a chain of events that wiped out everything living. So, it's up to Janeway to try to figure out how to prevent this.This is an okay episode but the resolution was the biggest problem. It just seemed contrived and the ending was not especially memorable.",6

This detonation derived from some time of polaric energy explosionbut what exactly caused it? Investigating the incident (life readings indicate no sign of existence on the planet), Janeway and her away team transport to the sight of the accident. Inexplicably, Thomas Paris and Janeway find themselves one day backward in time, due to a type of ""time fracture"". Paris and Janeway actually are ""relocated"" to the exact spot one day before, eventually involved in a plot by saboteurs protesting the use of polaric energy. Subspace fractures, com badges indicating positions, polaric explosion possibly triggered by a rescue attempt inadvertently, and the chance to change the outcome of an annihilated race: the time travel plot Star Trek is famous for gets the Voyager treatment this go-around. Star Trek, in all of its various series, almost always gets this kind of plot right.Of course, if you start to scrutinize the plot, it leaves open the usual time travel questions. Okay, so Janeway and Paris getting transported back a day in time due to a subspace fracture caused by a polaric explosion that occurred *before* the Voyager arrived to the planet could be the actual catalyst in all the annihilation of a planet of people? Yet, Janeway could actually realize that the rescue attempt using a generator to locate the fracture and her coordinates and through her phaser stop them, halting the explosion as the device used to find her would have impacted with the ""polaric conduit"". The explosion draws the Voyager to the planet. The Voyager goes to the planet to see why. And yet they are responsible for the explosion? This episode might require not contemplating too deeply about the particulars of the plot. To take a page from the screenplay: the fractures might show. But I dug how the episode alternates in past and present as Janeway and Paris exist elsewhere while Chakotay, Torres, Tuvok, Kim, and Kes try to place their coordinates in order to rescue them. I especially enjoyed the use of Kes in the episode, as there's emphasis on her perceptive abilities to sense presence, experience what others cannot, and see events as they (might/could/possibly) happen. But in this episode, Kes' ""mind power"" doesn't even have its surface scratched quite yet.The Prime Directive once again goes under the knife, with its capacity to prevent catastrophic results due to the hindrance in developmental growth in the ongoing evolution of species once again under review thanks in part to how interference might in fact help not hurt this pre-warp world the Voyager encounters while traveling through the cursed quadrant. Paris and a boy, that sees him and Janeway just appear due to the fracture in time, have a chance to bond after a shaky start, but I thought it was the weakest aspect of the episode...it doesn't quite work due to the boy's antics, as he persists in causing nothing but trouble. Paris saving him should have been of greater dramatic impact but seems lacking.",5

Neelix calls in to say he has detected a life sign but before the rest of the away team can get to him he is attacked by an alien who shoots him with a strange weapon. When the others get to him he can't breathe; once back on Voyager the Doctor's scans reveal that the alien weapon had transported his lungs out of his body. The Doctor manages to give him a pair of holographic lungs but if he is to survive he will never be able to move again unless Voyager can find the people who stole his lungs. The trail leads them to a hollow asteroid but once inside they can't find the alien ship as the asteroid's inside is like a hall of mirrors. When they ultimately find the aliens they find they are the Vidiians, a race suffering from a terrible disease called the phage. It turns out it is too late for them to give Neelix his lungs back but their advanced medicine means they can save him by transplanting one of Kes's lungs.This was a pretty good episode; the Vidiians are a especially frightening species as there is something particularly frightening about having ones organs stolen in such a way, more frightening than killing the victim first. As well as having a gripping story this episode provided some nice character development for Kes and the Doctor; Jennifer Lien and Robert Picardo did well in the roles.",8

Stealing the body part isn't the only weird thing-- but how quickly end efficiently. As for Neelix, the holo-doctor is able to temporarily keep him alive--but it's only temporary and they need to find his missing lungs. The trail leads to some freaky folks who steal body parts-- and you'll see more of these folks in future shows.Although the show does have a plot hole, the idea of intergalactic body part thieves is pretty cool. These morally questionable beings and their plight are very interesting and I enjoyed the episode completely. As for the plot hole, you sure would think that by the 24th century that they'd be able to synthesize organs. After all, scientists today have already had some success in experiments in this area and talk is that the production of replacement organs could occur in the next decade or two. So, you'd THINK that the Voyager folks could have quickly replaced Neelix's lungs AND helped the freaky aliens with their viral plight.",8

What makes this work is that Neelix acts the way anyone would under his circumstances. The villains (if we can call them that) have ridiculous powers that are so beyond the pale that I never accepted it. The positive is that given this lunatic plot, it is still quite well done.",6

Neelix's lungs have already been allocated to one of the aliens but this race is so medically skilled they are able to transplant one of Kes' lungs to Neelix. So, the aliens weren't evil, just desperate to save their own people. An interesting philosophic conundrum. I never particularly liked this episode except for its depiction of the growing friendship between the Doctor and Kes. Perhaps the makeup people did too good a job – the aliens were really ghastly looking. Also I perhaps didn't like it because its storyline of a disease ravaging a people is not that far-fetched.

Doctor develops a breakthrough procedure, inventing a machine that produces ""holo-lungs"" for Neelix so he will survive, stemming from holograph technology. While Neelix feels imprisoned and depressed while harnessed in the holo-lung machine, Janeway has the Voyager follow after the Vidiian vessel in the hopes of securing Neelix's stolen organs so that he will be restored to normal. The Vidiian ship retreats inside an asteroid as these mirrors mask its location, with the Voyager cautiously following them, eventually using minimum phaser fire to produce a ricochet effect which will reveal where they're hiding. One of my favorite character relationship developments on the show is Doctor and Kes; at first, Kes staying at Neelix's side while he's in the holo-lung machine, and serving also as a support system for the Doctor as he adapts to the lifeforms on board the Voyager, she a source of encouragement for him as he evolves with all the new experiences that arrive in his Sickbay. Here in this episode, the groundwork for their ongoing friendship is laidshe agrees happily to become his medical assistant and learn from him (so much medical knowledge is incorporated into his programming, and his creator developed him to adopt experiences to further evolve him) because Tom Paris is just not cut out for the Sickbay. The Vidiian couple, ravaged by the Phage (a flesh/organ/cell eating disease that deteriorates the body of their species), are eventually transported to the VoyagerKate Mulgrew once again just kills it with her reactions to their horrible situation, feeling pity and remorse for their condition but rage at how Neelix was attacked and raped of his lungs. How the Vidiian couple lament of their disease, how they were an artistic and scientific species reduced to organ stealing because their bodies deteriorate due to the Phage is just heart-wrenching; Janeway can barely look at them without wanting to break down into tears because of the agony and empathy she feels for them. Their genius, especially in regards to their medical knowledge, can be of use to Neelix, resulting in a pat, happy ending because of a diagnosis that doesn't correspond with Doctor'sthat a lung from Kes could be transplanted to Neelix and made compatible. The annoyance of Neelix's stay in Sickbay for Doctor is quite amusing, and the way the direction conveys the entrapment within the confines of the holo-lung machine is superbly claustrophobicthe whole ordeal certainly builds sympathy for Neelix's plight. The makeup effects for the Phage victims is gruesome...the makeup department did a good job of provoking a response concerning their flesh/body debilitating and ravaging Phage.",7
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Cloud (TV Episode 1995)",So so episode,"This isn't one of the stronger Voyager episodes, this is largely because instead of having one main story and one secondary story it has one main story and three minor stories, none of which are bad but none are that exciting either. In the main story Voyager goes into a nebula hoping to find a fuel supply, instead they find they are trapped inside it and their power is being drained. Using phasers and torpedoes they manage to escape but soon realise that it wasn't a nebula but a giant organism which they have injured so Janeway decides to take Voyager back in an attempt to heal the damage they've done. In the minor stories Neelix is thinking about leaving Voyager as he thinks the captain is a little too keen to put the ship in harms way; Chakotay tries to help the captain by introducing her to her spirit guide and Tom creates a new holodeck program, which replicates a French bar, for the crew to relax in.While there was nothing bad about this episode it never really gripped me as they never seemed in great danger and the secondary stories weren't to gripping either, the weakest being the introduction of the new holographic bar... although that might be down to my own bias against most holodeck based stories.",6

But at some point, military training MUST take over. After all, it'a captains' DUTY to protect his or her ship. Voyager enters the 'cloud' and gets trapped, and blasts it's way out. 14 crewmen hurt. The 'cloud' is a living thing, and hurt by the Voyager entering it.So what's JANEWAY going to do? Goes back in to HEAL the 'cloud'.First of all, I don't think any captain would risk casualties, or the whole ship, to heal the 'cloud'. Second, in TOS, there was always another opinion (Balance of Terror, for example), where Capt'n Kirk would ask for other view, like any good commander.I'm sure if Capt'n Janeway asked for thoughts about going back into the 'cloud' someone would have said ""You nuts for risking the ship"".Like the Dodo bird, Janeway should have sailed off, and not worried about the 'cloud'.",3

I am a fan of Reviewer Tweekums postings about Voyager and often we agree – but not always which is as it should be. I love holodeck- based stories and my favorite scenes in this episode were of the holographic bar. Well, that's what makes a horse race.

With seemingly endless possibilities, a seedy bar with holographic prostitutes simply cannot be the place you invite your crew-mates to hang out in. Lastly the chakotay section was actually alright, if a but fluffy, and constantly tight-roping the line between offensive and tasteful.Janeway comes across so far this season as a talented scientist with inconsistent command ability. In the same episode she puts down Neelix's whining with authority, and then later allows him to disrupt all bridge operations with a snack and a proclamation about his new self-appointed ship officer position. Others have already touched on her questionable decisions to risk everyone's life, ship power, and fuel reserves on a humanitarian detour.All in all, a Pretty weak and disjointed episode that never really impressed and leaves the viewer a little frustrated by the characters.",2

This episode focuses on exploring the unknown, encountering what they think is a nebula worthy of researching, not knowing it is a lifeform. When they investigate the nebula, for it is rich in omicron particles that could benefit the ship as an energy resource, they encounter a barrier that proves to be a nuisance. Organic matter attaching to the ship drains energy and the trip out of the ""nebula"" definitely exhausts reserves. It turns out that this isn't a nebula at all, with the use of weapons against it causing injury. So Janeway feels compelled to help heal it's wounds with use of the ship...the being also has regenerative abilities.This episode has a variety of subplots such as Paris introducing Kim to his French Bistro holographic program, Chakotay encouraging Janeway to find her spirit animal, Neelix reinventing himself as a morale officer to help boost the spirits of the crew, Kes planting an intimate kiss on the lips of an approving Neelix, and Janeway hoping to improve the morale of her crew by not distancing herself but instead integrating with them. Janeway's pool playing skills and the way Paris surrounds himself with French babes at the Bistro are highlights of the hologram. Neelix annoying Janeway about his new brand of coffee and surprising the crew on the Bridge with snacks offer some funnier moments.

The pace of this story is terrific – B'Elanna Torres thinks she knows a way to transport the crew to the Romulan science ship at the other end of the wormhole. Will it succeed? Even though we know it is unlikely to succeed since there will be about another 165 episodes, the writers had us almost believing it. Then the crew's hope is that they can convey messages to their families and friends through the wormhole and that the captain of the science ship will deliver them. We're left with a kind of lady or the tiger ending. I often prefer the secondary story lines to the main storyline. And this one is exceptional – Kes speaks to Captain Janeway on the Doctor's behalf; the crew are treating him badly by not even acknowledging his presence.

Like most new shows, the first few shows are a bit tentative--with characters still coming into their own and the shows not yet hitting their stride. This isn't a complaint--more just an observation. However, here in ""Eye of the Needle"", the show hit a home run--and it's among the better shows in the series.When the show begins, the Voyager crew discovers a tiny wormhole. It's too small for the ship but the hope is that they can send a probe to the hole and somehow bounce a message through to the other side...into the Alpha Quadrant. Well, it is a success but not a rousing one. The ship they contact on the other side of the galaxy is Romulan and this race of beings have always been portrayed a very paranoid. Getting the Romulans to help WON'T be easy, that's for sure. But the problems get far worse, because when they finally get this Romulan commander to agree to relay messages to their families and Starfleet, there is a heartbreaking realization...and it's something you'll just have to learn when you see the show.Like most Trek shows, this one has a secondary plot--but it's NOT an unimportant or slight one. Kes is a good study and is now working with the holo doctor. But she also notices that the humans on the ship treat him like dirt. After all, he's NOT alive and he's basically a tool. But she sees that he is much more and begins to bond with him and treat him as an equal. Kes then takes it upon herself to approach the Captain and request that something be done to remedy the crew's interactions with the doc--and thus begins the slow evolution of the doctor through the course of the film into an important and fully realized character. And, considering he IS the best character on the show, it's a journey I really enjoyed seeing.Overall, the reason I score this one a 10 is that it really is exquisitely written--and a bit heart-felt and sad near the end. There are so many clever things that the script contains and it's well worth seeing.",10

However This voyager episode arrives much sooner than The Next Generation's first great episode, and is special in a different way.This episode has two great story-lines and they go together very nicely. The crew discovers a tiny wormhole. It's too small to fly through, and the probe they send in doesn't make it all the way through it. However, the probe is able to make contact with a ship on the other side. They also learn that the wormhole, to their luck leads to the Alpha Quadrant. The bad news is that the ship they contact is a Romulan ship. The Romulans predictably don't trust the federation ship, but Voyager persistently keeps after them. They finally build some understanding and positive terms with the captain of the other ship. There is a touching moment where the Romulan captain informs Janeway that he travels through space over years without seeing has wife, and has never met his 7 month old daughter. The Romulan agrees to send a message to Starfleet informing them of their location. But next thing, Belanna discovers a possibility of beaming crew members from one ship to the other.This possibility really relates the the other storyline in the episode. Like many great story lines in Voyager, the Doctor is right in the thick of it. The doctor, in the very early stages of becoming more than a human convenience, becomes a sympathetic figure for Kess, who is learning to become a medical assistance. Only the crew being able to activate and deactivate the doctor, as well as the crew talking rudely to the doctor begin to agitate Kess. She bring up her concerns to the Captain. The captain then visits the doctor for the first time to treat him like a crew mate with feelings and needs, rather than a lifeless human serving hologram. The Captain decides to have engineers work to allow the doctor control his program's on or off state. Shortly after this good news for the doctor, Kess informs the Doctor that the entire crew might be able to beam off voyager through the wormhole into the alpha quadrant. The doctor would be left behind. The doctor asks Kess to make sure to turn off his program if he is left behind. The doctor's status is explored so well in this episode with him receiving news of more power in the future, before realizing he could be left behind all alone without the ability to turn hims program off, if it weren't for Kess.Back in the other story-line the crew becomes capable of transporting sample packages over to the Romulan ship, but the Romulan captain informs Voyager that the Romulans won't allow the Voyager crew to beam onto his ship, but the Romulan Captain says that the Romulan people might sent another ship for the Voyager crew to beam upon. The Romulan Captain does agrees to beam to voyager. The transport takes a lot of extra configuration and time, but is successful. Tuvoc then realizes by scanning the Romulan, that the wormhole transports through space and time. the Romulan captain is actually from 20 years in the past. The crew then are left unable to beam to the alpha quadrant, but the Romulan Captain agrees to relay their status to star-fleet in 20 years time. The viewer is just now thinking that the show has thrown the last good curve-ball, and the result of the episode will be a first contact back with earth. However, Tuvoc informs the ship the moment the Romulan is beamed back, that the Romulan entrusted with their information, according to computer records, dies 4 years before Voyager get lost in space. It's really a very sad moment for everyone but the doctor, who's the lone beneficiary of the bad news because his crew doesn't leave him behind.The strange connection between the rival federation and Romulans is very interesting and touching. The Doctor's story arc is gripping and emotionally contemplative. And Overall they make the episode distinctive, exciting, melancholy, memorable, and IMO the best Voyager episode prior to Scorpion episodes.",10
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Eye of the Needle (TV Episode 1995)",A visit from the Alpha Quadrant,"When Ensign Kim detects a wormhole the crew are hopeful that it might lead back to the Alpha Quadrant the crew is understandable excited, unfortunately when they get to it they discover it is far too small for Voyager to pass through. It is just large enough for a probe to enter but it looks like even that idea won't work as it gets stuck before it exits the worm hole. On the off chance anybody is near the other end of the worm hole they send a signal and they do indeed get a reply which to their great pleasure is indeed from the Alpha Quadrant; it looks as though they will at least be able to send a message home. The first problem they have though is that their message has been received by a Romulan scientist who is sceptical when they tell him where they are, and once he has come to believe them and B'Elanna comes up with the idea of transporting the crew through the wormhole he says they wouldn't be allowed on his ship. He does offer to call a troop ship to help but before doing that he transports to Voyager to check that it is possible to transport through the wormhole and only then do they make an important discovery about the wormhole; not only does it go to the Alpha Quadrant, it also goes more than twenty years into the past. Realising they can't go back the crew record messages and give them to the Romulan who promises to give them to Star Fleet after Voyager has gone to the Delta Quadrant. In a secondary story thread Kes goes to the Captain to argue that the crew need to treat The Doctor with more respect as he has become more than just a standby and should be treated like any other member of the crew; to this end the Captain offers to change his program so that he is in control of when he gets deactivated.This was a good and memorably episode of Voyager. The story was well written, nicely raising hopes that they might get home before inevitably dashing them. While they mat have lacked the drama of the main story, the secondary scenes between Kes and The Doctor were some of the best in the episode, Jennifer Lien and Robert Picardo did very well injecting a lot of feeling into those scenes which helped show how caring Kes is and how the Doctor has real feelings even if he is just a holographic program.",9
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Eye of the Needle (TV Episode 1995)",Star Trek: Voyager - Eye of the Needle,"A ""micro-wormhole"" is discovered by Ensign Kim as a possible way out of the godforsaken, uncharted Delta Quadrant, leaving the crew of the Voyager in excitement at the prospects of getting home by traveling through it back to the Alpha Quadrant. However, they realize, when sending a probe into it, the wormhole is decaying, deteriorating, dying. Much to their delight, a response from the other side of the wormhole reveals a Romulan science officer, Telek R'Mor (a subtly rich performance from Vaughn Armstrong), who reluctantly corresponds with the Voyager crew, admitting his distrust in their mission, considering them Federation spies. When Janeway convinces R'Mor that her crew is in fact genuinely lost and trying to find their way home to the Alpha Quadrant, his suspicion fades. Even more promising, Torres believes they have produced a potential breakthrough in transport technologythe ability to transport off of the Voyager through the wormhole onto the Romulan vessel. They will need to get Telek R'Mor's cooperation, though. The twist involving the wormhole's rift not only in space but time produces devastating results. Could R'Mor perhaps relay a message to the Federation? R'Mor does say he would tell his homeworld of the Voyager ""at the appropriate time"".There's a really generous subplot involving ""holodeck doc"" Robert Picardo portrays, as Kes goes to Janeway with a plea to recognize him as more than just a hologram that can be deactivated when not in use. That Picardo is more than just some program that can be adjusted if Janeway so orders is a plot that I fully embrace. An ever evolving character that is more than what was initially intended, and how Picardo offers quiet reflection and surprise to others like Kes and Janeway who inform him that he is beyond just a computer simulation that can be reprogrammed is a huge step forward for the character. Then the Doctor gaining confidence in how patients treat him, encouraged by Kes' support, addressing others to realize he exists and doesn't deserve their disrespect, is a pivotal moment in his development as a character. His wanting a name adds gravitas to the Doctorbut will he ever be able to find a satisfactory name? Armstrong's reactions—with all the hesitation, distrust, and calculated response—to distance himself from the Federation, as he's always been taught and trained, gradually uncoiling didn't go unappreciated by this viewer. I think just responding to the crew, considering the time he comes from in difference to them, when beamed on the Voyager, and the disappointment that he couldn't help them shows you this change in a character initially not resolved to talk to them much at all. I like how it tells you that despite Romulan and Federation relations, over just a small period of time there can be progress between them. It just takes the willingness to try. The near rescue of the wormhole, only to be dealt the blow of what lies at the other side in regards to time, is the perfect let-down. This was only the first season and the Delta Quadrant had plenty of unknowns yet to explore. But their being so close to a chance of returning home only to be denied is tragic.",8

Tom Paris is framed for a murder on the planet Banea. He was fooling around with the wife of an important scientist and the charge was that Paris killed the jealous husband. Ensign Kim was pretty disgusted with Paris in the early part of the show which was refreshing. Found guilty, the Baneans plant a devise in Paris' brain that causes him to re-live the murder every 14 hours. The devise is beginning to harm other parts of Paris' brain and Tuvok is sent to investigate the murder. At this point in the series Tuvuk is still a pretty boring character but he does get more interesting as the series goes on. The battle scene between the Voyager and Numiri war ships (the Numiri are at war with the Baneans) was well done and interesting as was the scene with the Doctor and Kes.

Tom Paris, who is notorious for always getting into hot water, did it here and ended up convicted of a murder which he insisted he had not committed and was sentenced to what could have easily destroyed his mind if not actually killing him. But Tuvok, whose duties as chief of security include criminal investigation, performed his first mind-meld in the series and quickly determined that Paris not only could not have committed the murder but was actually framed! So I'm watching certain episodes of this series with the concentration on Mr. Tuvok and how he approaches the process of mind-melding, and I like the guy---he's my second favorite Vulcan next to Spock, and I'm enjoying comparing the two different concepts.

I liked it on balance but felt like the writer didn't quite hit the mark.When the show begins, an away team beams to an asteroid within the rings of a planet below. Once there, however, they find dead bodies everywhere--bodies which were sent there by some unknown people. Chakotay insists that the team members do not touch or disturb the corpses in any way--as it would be disrespectful and violate the Prime Directive. He's right...too bad Harry Kim is an idiot. This is because when he tries to transport back to the ship, some weird space vacuole appears and transports him back to the planet which has sent their dead to the asteroid! He's the first person to return from the dead as far as these people are concerned--and this can cause havoc for these people and their religious beliefs. This part annoyed me because EVERYONE at Starfleet is drilled with the notion NOT to contaminate other planets--yet dumb 'ol Harry begins talking rather freely to these people--too freely. In fact, this is a serious plot problem because he behaved like he'd never heard of the Prime Directive.Harry, though, is not the only confound. When another body is transported to the asteroid and bodies start appearing on the ship because it is in close proximity, the Doctor decides to revive one of these recently dead bodies. After all, he can cure her illness easily. But this ends up scaring the daylights out of the lady as she expected to be on her planet's version of Heaven and the planet below isn't even where she was born. It's naturally very confusing and now we have the Captain thinking about sending this lady back to her planet once they locate it--but wouldn't that also violate the much-beloved Prime Directive?!So, to really enjoy this one you need to accept that Voyager forgot the Prime Directive---which is even harder since this show is so ethically bound and drips in the Prime Directive in other episodes. Inconsistent, that's for sure. It's really a shame, though, as shows about the afterlife and religion are interesting and I did enjoy this aspect of the program.

Although Seska advocates strongly against doing so, Torres insists that the Captain be told what they have done. Martha Hackett's portrayal of Seska is right on as the devious, lying conspirator who wants to cover up their actions (""No one will ever know"" – sound familiar?). Two quibbles with this otherwise engaging episode: 1) it is simply not believable that Tuvok would go against the Captain's wishes in such an underhanded fashion and 2) although obviously and quite rightly the Captain is disappointed and angry at Torres, it is unfortunate that she could not at least acknowledge Torres' honor in telling her what they had done.

Harry is surprised when while on a date with one of the Sikarians he is taken to another planet using a transporter device which is vastly superior to anything he has seen before, so good that if Voyager could use the device it would knock forty years off their journey home. Janeway asks the Sikarian leader if they can have such a device to help them get home but her request is declined as they have a rule about giving technology to other races; a rule almost identical to Star Fleet's Prime Directive.

Of course when they get the device it doesn't work as planned and the captain is disappointed with the actions of her trusted senior officers.This episode does not contain much in the way of action but poses some nice moral dilemmas for the crew; how can they expect other people to break their rules to help them when they are unwilling to break the Prime Directive to help others in need.

The first time I watched this episode I was unsure as to whether Carey or Seska would be the traitor; the evidence appeared to point to the latter but she always had an explanation leading me to suspect that Carey would be the traitor after all the Maquis had already been infiltrated by one person, a second seemed unlikely... as to who the traitor is; I won't spoil that.

What caused this is a shocker for the crew--the Kazon did this to themselves when they were trying to install new hardware onto their ship....Federation designed hardware!! Obviously they got it from the Federation and since Voyager is the only Federation ship anywhere near Kazon space, it's logical to assume someone is passing this material on to this warlike and annoying race. As I said, I liked the idea of a traitor. I just wish that the show had led up to this better--now just tossed it out without much leading up to it. You did see this evil character display some rather amoral thinking in a previous episode--but that was it. So, there wasn't a lot of finesse associated with this plot. Additionally, considering that the people investigating thought she was a traitor, don't you think they would have done a MUCH better job keeping her confined at the end of the show?! This was pretty dumb. Heck, putting her in handcuffs or punching her in the nose would have been a lot more effective and her escape was pretty obviously done to facilitate her return as a nemesis.

Not surprisingly since the missing crewmen were all main characters this works... that doesn't mean there is no loss though; the Doctor became friends with Freya, one of the holographic characters, and she is killed protecting him from another character who distrusts him.This was a decent episode although given the number of times the holodecks have malfunctioned and endangered crew members in the various series it is amazing this dangerous technology is still in use. It did give the opportunity to see the Doctor somewhere other than sickbay though and he finally picks a name although after Freya's death he decides not to keep it. This could have been a worse episode but Robert Picardo does a great job as the Doctor and makes a potentially bland story fun.

Captain Janeway decides to take the ship back to the site of where Tuvok says they were attacked, but strange things happen on the way there; various crew members seem to sabotage the voyage by turning the ship around, but without knowing that they're doing it. The Doctor investigates, and finds evidence that these crew members have been temporarily possessed by an alien intelligence, one which migrates from person to person.Engaging setup, no? Unfortunately, the big twist is that the ""alien intelligence"" is CHAKOTAY. Oyyyyy. Tuvok has been possessed by a noncorporeal creature throughout the episode, and the two of them have been fighting to keep the ship from returning to the nebula where ""Tuvok""'s people live. The bridge crew successfully overpowers Tuvok, the noncorporeal creature leaves him, and all is well.Even Chakotay! The Doctor just, um, re-integrates his consciousness. Isn't that something! I know you have to push the reset button at the end of the episode, but geez this takes WAY too much suspension of disbelief, even in freaking Star Trek.I loved the setup with a mysterious being taking control of crew members to do its bidding, but it didn't end up paying off with much at all.",4
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Cathexis (TV Episode 1995)",Star Trek: Voyager - Cathexis,"One of the most bizarre twists in Trek history, in my opinion, closes this episode of Voyager as Chakotay and Tuvok return from a trade negotiation having encountered a mind-hopping entity out of a dark matter nebula. Chakotay has no brain function, while Tuvok experiences mind possession along with other members of the crew. Janeway wants to return to the nebula to find the ship Tuvok says the shuttle came across, but the alien moves from one brain to another and seems set on them not, interrupting course by whatever means necessary. Meanwhile the crew soon believe, besides the alien moving about, there's another consciousness also alternating from one officer to another opposing it in regards to the course towards the nebula. Chakotay's involvement in the storyline, regarding out of body consciousness able to use crew members like the alien possessor, and how Doctor can return it to his body just had me in ribbons...I just found all of this preposterous. I did enjoy the medicine wheel as a character device but it telling Janeway about planets in the nebula by Chakotay's consciousness invading Neelix had me tickled. An invasion-of-the-body-snatchers plot seems ideal to me, and I thought the episode is quite fast paced and fun for the majority but that ending just collapses all the good will it built with this viewer. Seeing the crew grappling with a ship controlled by a force invading their mind momentarily in order of course correction/stop conveys all the perplexity, paranoia, surprise, puzzlement, anxiety, and frustration obviously suffered by them all considering their situation. Tuvok invaded and commandeering the Bridge with a mass phaser burst is a startling moment. Seeing Doctor seriously considered as a fail safe for captaining the ship by Janeway really speaks volumes with how disruptive the non-corporeal entity was to the crew of the ship. Kes and her telepathic abilities viewed as a threat, with possessed Tuvok unknowingly using a Vulcan neck pinch to injure her conveys just how dangerous the entity is. A potentially great episode undermined by silly conclusion.",5

This is a really weak episode. There is suspicion among the crew even though they've been here before. Oh well. I know from having watched the whole thing before that there were growing pains.",5
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Faces (TV Episode 1995)",The first truly excellent Voyager Episode,"After the pilot, this the first Voyager episode that doesn't come off as the weak sister of a TNG ep. Some of the previous episodes were clearly recycled TNG (and even TOS) episodes. Some were just ho-hum.This is the first one with a tightly written plot and sharply drawn characters.THIS is the kind of episode that I've been waiting for. A desperate situation. Wonderful acting by Roxann Caballero Biggs Dawson (can we just call her the most beautiful Klingon-Human hybrid since Susie Plakson?). If ever there's been a Star Trek race more deserving of extermination, it's the Vidiians--truly morally (and visually) repellent aliens.It's rather amazing that an alliances of Delta Quadrant species hasn't banded together to wipe them out--given what a threat they are to every humanoid their sociopathic evolution of their culture presents. Every further encounter with them, with the exception of the Doctor's romance with the Vidiian hematologists Dr. Danara Pell, always results in an attempt to murder everyone aboard Voyager and steal the usable organs.Whether this has been in the minds of the writers I don't know, but I'm led to think of the Chinese Communist government's execution of 10-15,000 ""criminals"" (the only ""crime"" many have committed is demanding freedom and an end to repression) and the subsequent sale of the victims' organs to foreigners who can bring the Chinese foreign currency--a must for their frenzied defense build up targeted against the United States and Japan. However sinister the end, it's the means that most disturb me--both with the fictional Vidiians the real life corollary in Red China. It's a scheme so repulsive its hard to imagine even the Ferengi participating in it.This is Star Trek at its best: riveting story telling coupled with a look inward at the early 21st Century from the perspective of a fictional, Utopian future. As Nicholas Meyer, direction and writer of Star Trek II & VI and writer of Stark Trek IV, puts in the commentary to ""Wrath of Khan"" (on the now out of print ""Director's Cut""): ""The job of the artist is to ask questions. It's the job of the audience to supply the answers."" If you're reading this what answers do YOU bring to Vidiians and their relevance to the societal crimes of our species?",8
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Faces (TV Episode 1995)","Two B'Elannas... one Klingon, one human","This episode opens with B'Elanna held captive and looking far more Klingon than she usually does, it turns out that she has been captured by the Vidiians along with Paris and Lt, Durst. The Vidiians have done something to her which has divided her into two people, one Kingon the other human. The scientist who did it explains that he did it because he believes Klingons may be immune to the phage so could help provide a cure. While Klingon B'Elanna is restrained in a lab Human B'Elanna is put to work in the mines alongside Paris and the previously unknown Dunst has the misfortune of being taken to organ processing. The Vidiian scientists things he will be less repulsive to B'Elanna if he has a proper face although when she sees him wearing Dunst's face her reaction is rather violent. The people back on Voyager take a while to realise that they are dealing with the Vidiians but when they finally learn what they are dealing with Chakotay is disguised as a Vidiian so he can help the others escape. When the two B'Elannas get together they must learn that they will need to use both of their innate skills if they are to escape.This was a pretty good episode which explored B'Elanna's character in an interesting way, it was nice to see her different sides even though it was inevitable that by the end of the episode she would be back to her usual self. When I heard that Torres, Paris and Durst have disappeared while exploring an asteroid it seemed inevitable that Dunst wouldn't be coming back, even though they no longer wear red shirts it still seems that any crew member who gets a major role when we haven't seen them before is likely to die. The moment when we learn just what Dunst has been used for was pretty chilling; justifying the characters inclusion.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Faces (TV Episode 1995)",I like the Vidiian episodes.,"For the most part, the early episodes of ""Star Trek: Voyager"" are kind of dull. Too many non-corporeal entities, too many holodeck experiences and too few interesting enemies mar these shows. However, a bright spot are the Vidiian episodes, as these evil aliens are truly frightening. So, ""Faces"" is clearly one of the better shows of season one because it features these icky looking jerks.When the show begins, an away team of three is kidnapped by the Vidiians. What they do with Torres is particularly interesting, as these sick creatures know a way to separate her Klingon and Human DNA and they now have two Lt. Torreses--one of each. Through the course of the show, Torres learns a lot about herself and learns to appreciate both halves of her--much like Kirk did in the old ""Star Trek"" show where he was separated in two by a transporter malfunction--creating a nasty and evil Kirk as well as a passive and wimpy one. The idea certainly isn't new but combined with the Vidiians, it makes for interesting viewing.Two things to note: You get to see Roxann Dawson (Torres) without her make-up which is nice and you get to see another Talaxian--and he's even MORE annoying than Neelix!!",7
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Faces (TV Episode 1995)",Roxanne Dawson shows her acting chops,"Star Trek Voyager is my favorite of the 2nd generation Star Trek series precisely because of episodes like this. The women in Voyager have serious, raw, powerful acting chops. I have always loved watching Jeri Ryan and Kate Mulgrew, whose portrayals of their characters have always drawn me fully into the show, but until I saw this episode I never understood the range and power of Roxanne Dawson's talent. I can't believe I got to watch a show with 3 such powerful, complex women. Lucky lucky me.",8
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Faces (TV Episode 1995)","Terrific performance piece for Roxann Dawson, terrific examination of the character","This episode has one of the shortest cold opens in Star Trek history, merely showing a voice calling to B'Elanna Torres and a....fully Klingon woman raising her head to answer?!?!? Three Voyager lieutenants have been kidnapped by the Vidiian Sodality, but Torres gets special attention. A Vidiian scientist believes her Klingon DNA could be the key to curing the terrible phage that afflicts the Vidiians, and with their advanced medical technology he is able to separate her Klingon DNA from her human DNA and constitute them into two separate people.With the different bodies come radically different personalities. Eventually Klingon B'Elanna and Human B'Elanna meet up and try to team up and escape. They don't seem to agree on much of anything. Klingon B'Elanna simply wants to kill everyone she sees, while Human B'Elanna is more tactical and strategic. Through their combined efforts, they are able to make it back to Voyager safely, though Klingon B'Elanna dies on the transporter pad.It wasn't the ending I expected, and it was quite poignant. I expected the two halves of B'Elanna would be reconstituted together in the transporter, whether accidentally or intentionally. Instead, there was quite a nice scene with Human B'Elanna in Sick Bay. There's some Treknobabble reason why the Klingon DNA must be reconstituted back into Human B'Elanna - after all, they can't very well just change the character. But the scene with Human B'Elanna and Chakotay in the Sick Bay was very poignant, with Human B'Elanna saying that even though she feels more at peace with herself than ever, she is incomplete without her other half. Anyone who's gone through a major life transition can identify with that feeling. There is a comfort in familiarity, but it's an illusion. You're not yourself unless you're yourself.The episode does come off as a tiny bit racist, but when you're racist against a fictional race of aliens, that's not a big deal (when the Klingons make their own TV shows, they can be racist against us~!). B'Elanna is described as having her Klingon DNA ""extracted,"" with Human B'Elanna seeming to retain all of the memories and life experiences. The ending certainly establishes Human B'Elanna as the baseline, with Klingon B'Elanna as some sort of cohabitator. However, this is also explained away by details of B'Elanna's childhood (which themselves were interesting to hear).A great performance piece for Roxann Dawson to play the same character two drastically different ways, and a great psychological examination of those characters. Easily the best episode of Voyager season 1.",9
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Faces (TV Episode 1995)",B'Elana is beside herself,"It's still the first season, and so episodes focusing on developing one of the main characters are in the menu. Here, it is the turn of B'Elana. Surely, Klingon mentality within human societies is always a decent starting point for Star Trek to comment on various aspects of human behaviour. Here, B'Elana's mixed heritage and how both parts of it are fundamental to her identity is the focus of the episode. And while this is a very Star-Treky message, the episode itself is less than stellar:I mean, the Vidiians capture her and actually split her into two people. This is not just all too obvious a metaphor, it's also plain silly. Luckily (?), the Klingon half dies in the end (after a villain's pretty pointless shooting), and the Doctor announces he can reattach her Klingon DNA back or something. I know Star Trek has never been big in the science, but it would have been nice if during the 90s they had tried to at least avoid such glaring mumbo jumbo.A second reason the episode disappointed me, however, is because it completely wastes a much more interesting plotline: the whole story is framed as a standard rescue mission, with very little attention given to what is the actual dilemma. Passing a message about the importance of mixed heritage and hopefully helping real world youth accept themselves is all good, but also a rather obvious lesson (which has also been repeated by Worf, Odo and so on in other Star Treks). The question of whether a dying species has the right to use unwilling human (or Klingon if you prefer) subjects in its attempts to find a cure is much more profound, and is largely ignored here. However, since this is the second episode the Vidiians appear, I hope and suspect the issue will receive further attention in future seasons.",6

In this second venture, the Vidiians believe that B'Elanna's Klingon DNA will provide a cure for the phage and the scientists split B'Elanna into two people - one Klingon and one human. Of course the two meet and the different personalities are explored in a much oversimplified way. They join forces to escape (with Lt. Paris) the ghastly, grim and really horrid Vidiian prison. Even though a terrible fate awaits the Vidiians, it's hard to dredge up a lot of sympathy for a people that horribly kills and mutilates others to save themselves. At the end, the Klingon and human DNA must be re-integrated. It was nice that Roxann Dawson Biggs- Dawson got the chance to flex her acting muscles - she must have enjoyed doing this episode and she did a fine job with the dual roles.

We GET IT ALREADY, the future has lots of aliens, just tell your story. The problem is, sometimes there is no story, which is why you have fall back on some contrived fight in order to fill air time. You have a Vidiian who takes the face of a fellow Voyager crew member and he's surprised at the response? It smacks of forcing the issue again to fill air time. Feels like lazy writing. To top it all off, the killing will continue since the Vidiians no longer have the Klingon DNA to help solve their problem. Yay for more madness from the writers.",10

Voyager receives a message from a scientist named Jetrel who says that he would like to meet with Neelix. When he does, Neelix is devastated to learn that this was the man who developed and set off a weapon (cascade) during a war between the Talaxians and Haakonians that destroyed a colonized moon and killed hundreds of thousands of people including Neelix's entire family. Jetrel says that Neelix may be ill from the lingering aftermath of the cascade and that he wants to cure this disease if Neelix has it. The parallels between this story and America's dropping atomic bombs on Japan are obvious and a bit overdone but still thought provoking. The anguish, pain and guilt Neelix displays shows us a much more serious side to Neelix and Ethan Phillips does a good job conveying these feelings. James Sloyan as Jetrel also delivers an excellent portrayal of someone in incredible emotional pain. As reviewer Tweekums has said, the ending is very moving. The questions this episode pose have no easy answers - and perhaps no answer at all.",8

This man, Dr. Jetrel has some bad news; as Neelix went home shortly after the attack he may be suffering from a fatal disease and after a check up he confirms that Neelix is indeed infected. As a form of atonement for his part in the attack Jetrel claims to be trying to find a cure at to this end he says they need to go to the Telaxian moon where he plans to extract particles from the atmosphere. Once he has the particles it becomes apparent that Jetrel has not been telling the entire truth, if he had been he wouldn't have deactivated the Doctor or tranquillised Neelix... the only question is what exactly is he planning to do that he couldn't tell anybody about. Jetrel's arrival on Voyager also makes Neelix confront his own demons; he had been keen to blame Jetrel for his family's death but also feels guilty as he lied when he told people he was away fighting with the Telaxian military, in reality he refused to serve believing it was an unjustified war.This was a pretty good episode which examined some of the moralities of war, was Jetrel evil for making this weapon when we don't know if his race started the war or were just defending themselves, watching it I was sure that his cascade weapon was a metaphor for the atomic bomb. Ethan Phillips did a good job as Neelix, The situation gave him a chance to portray a greater acting range as Neelix was understandable not his usual jovial self. Without spoiling it I will say that I thought the episode had a good ending.",8

But there is more to this than meets the eye and it could be associated with the scientist, Jetrel (James Sloyan), himself. Obvious ties to the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Oppenheimer specifically, this episode takes a serious look at the cost of war, those who suffered the effects and the loss that results from any weapon that annihilates a large swath of people. But even further this episode speaks about the enduring toll of carrying around shame and guilt, as Neelix admits to being a coward, going away to hide instead of joining the Talaxian defense force. He must forgive himself before he could ever contemplate forgiving Jetrelif that could even be possible. Kes, there as moral support for Neelix, provides a comforting support to her beloved. Janeway allows Jetrel to board and check Neelix's vitals, informing him he does have Metremia while she tries to contemplate it all. Jetrel is a fascinating character in that he is nearly all scientist, later revealing that with science comes both achievement and consequence, returning to his home planet with a wife and family moving away from him because she considered him as much a monster like almost all Talaxians. The later revelation of using the transporter as a means to possibly return those who were eviscerated by the doomsday device, and their bio-matter existing in a state of suspended animation is quite incredible to wrap one's head around. You can see why Tuvok and Janeway are not convinced Jetrel's belief that he can bring the Talaxians back; it is all just so fantastic. Then the transporter is used to try and you can see the faint bodily form of a Talaxian emerge, as Neelix draws in closer in amazementonly for it to all be unsuccessful and seemingly impossible. And then Jetrel tells Neelix the truth and admitted that he's considered a Talaxian sympathizer, banished by his own kind, left to die in the sickbay of the Voyager. You could only hope that his research and experiments are catalogued and don't die with himthat his last fifteen years of work aren't in vain. Phillips gets some meat on the bones with his character and some dramatic back story, powerful and chilling, so Neelix goes beyond the skeleton of comedy reliefthat is what Trek can do so well. That Jetrel is not presented as just a monster, some cartoonish villain, with Neelix confronting him, the two discussing the past and addressing the future, as science comes under investigation, with a ton of emotionally potent subject matter powerfully elaborated.",8

This evil doctor requests to see Neelix--and not surprisingly, Neelix has no interest in seeing the guy. But Jetrel insists--saying that Neelix might be dying of Metremia and he needs to test him to be certain. However, there is DEFINITELY more to this than Jetrel is saying--and he has an underhanded agenda.

The Maquis selected are very unhappy about this and refuse to participate until Chakotay brings them round with a demonstration of ""the Maquis way."" While the boot camp like training is going on, Voyager is being threatened by catastrophe as the bioneural gel packs that operate all of the ship's systems (including life-support) are breaking down. Since the Tuvok character is one of my least favorites, it is not surprising that I found this show basically ordinary despite the fact that the especially bitter Maquis Crewman Dalby was both believable and interesting.

This isn't so much a complaint--I just don't want the viewer to assume the show is anything more than it is.When the show begins, Captain Janeway is in the holodeck doing some stupid program that looks a lot like ""A Turn of the Screw"" and ""Jane Eyre"". Fortunately, something interrupts and the plot begins in earnest--a meeting with her, Chakotay and Tuvak. It seems that Tuvak is concerned because several of the Maquis crew members suck when it comes to discipline. The solution they come up with is to put selected members, the problematic ones, through a boot camp style program so that they learn discipline and teamwork. There is a serious problem with this, however, as the four folks chosen really, really suck. What's worse, the teacher assigned to these folks is Tuvok--and, it turns out, he ALSO sucks!

Not to mention, the Maquis act like recalcitrant seventh graders (believe me, I know. I taught them for 43 years). The whole thing, leading up to a contrived conclusion is almost embarrassing. I'm amazed they got a second season after this.",5

Tuvok happens to be in the area, and asks him what he's doing. He then gives the PERFECTLY LOGICAL explanation that he saw there was a problem, and he fixed it. Instead of reporting to higher ups and going through a chain of bureaucracy that would likely see the ship lose all power long before anyone got around to fixing it.TUVOK has a problem with this, and chews out this man, causing him to freak out and yell at him.So after complaining to Janeway, she appoints Tuvok to try to teach four Maquis crewmembers the Starfleet way and try to integrate them with the rest of the crew.On the first meeting, Tuvok snottily lashes out verbally at the crewmembers for the most menial and insignificant of 'offenses', such as speaking out of line, all while interrupting them when they ARE speaking IN line, shutting them up, and punishing them with physical labor for trying to explain themselves.One of the crewmembers isn't standing upright and staring at Tuvok, so he goes and chews him out, forcing him to say he understands Tuvok, and to keep his head up. Then their de-facto leader, Ensign Dolby tells Tuvok the blatantly obvious; THEY NEVER WANTED TO BE IN STARFLEET! THEY NEVER WANTED TO BE HERE! THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL STRANDED TOGETHER! He says they have tried to adapt to Starfleet and work together, whereas Tuvok is just abusing and harrassing them for his own pleasure.Rather than address them, he says they are insubordinate for trying to leave and orders them to stay where they are.You don't need to be an emotional people person to peacefully deal with them without behaving like a machine.Speaking of people persons, later on Chakotay asks Dolby about the event. Dolby says they're willing to learn, but they're NOT going to tolerate being treated like teenaged cadets. They tell how Tuvok picked on them, and forced one of them to run laps.So naturally, the proper response is for Chakotay to PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE! I am not joking. This would be hilarious if it weren't treated so seriously, and as though it were the REASONABLE thing to do. Naturally, Chakotay, being the Starfleet first officer--- Oh wait, Chakotay IS A MAQUIS HIMSELF! So we get some more scenes of torture, not physically but psychologically, with Tuvok snottily chewing them out for their being out of uniform. It consists of one crewmember wearing a hairband, one wearing a necklace UNDERNEATH THEIR UNIFORM WHERE YOU COULD HARDLY SEE IT, ONE HAVING SCUFFED BOOTS THAT ARE NOT POLISHED, and Dolby, whom Tuvok just doesn't like, apparently.So Tuvok then has a surprise for them, in the form of an exercise at 1900 hours for field training. This consists of... RUNNING! We get an overly long sequence set to HAPPY MUSIC featuring Tuvok forcing the Maquis crewmembers to climb and run around the ship for no real reason with no breaks, and with many parts in front of other crewmembers, WHO LAUGH AT THEM! After they've finished running, Tuvok reveals they've run 10.1 KM, and that he increased the gravity by 10% to make it harder. Then, because two of them stopped several times, he forces them to KEEP RUNNING! More hazing includes Tuvok forcing one of the Maquis crewmembers to do what amounts to scrubbing toilets with a toothbrush by making one of them ""degauss"" a transporter pad with a device that would take him 26 hours to complete.Then comes a wargame situation, where they are ambushed by TWO Romulan Warbirds and die and lose. Of course, Tuvok expects them to learn from their mistakes without telling them what they did. They did everything by the book, exactly the way Starfleet would. He then says they should have retreated.... except that they were under ATTACK by the Romulans that saw their hull breach and shields buckle. By retreating, they'd likely be destroyed even faster, as their warp drive would have needed some time to warm up and engage.Of course, that's not what's explained by the Maquis, they just pull a Klingon by saying ""WE DON'T RETREAT!"" SHOCKINGLY, Tuvok CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY HE'S NOT GETTING THROUGH TO THE MAQUIS CREWMEMBERS! He talks about how he's taught THOUSANDS of Academy cadets and made real success with them.Except that those were teenagers who WANTED to get into Starfleet. These are Maquis adults who DO NOT WANT to be a part of Starfleet, and HAVE NO CHOICE! Again shockingly, it's NEELIX who helps Tuvok, by telling him he should BEND the rules and ADAPT to the Maquis and try to get to know them! UNBELIEVABLE that TUVOK is too damn STUPID to figure this out on his own! Speaking of which, it turns out Neelix's cheese is what is making the biological components sick and threatening to destroy the ship. It just wouldn't be ""Voyager"" without something like that.And so at the end, Tuvok bends the rules a bit, and this somehow makes up for ALL the abuse the Maquis went through, complete with the tawdry, hackneyed line from Dolby ""If you can learn to bend the rules, I'm sure we can learn to follow them"".",1
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Learning Curve (TV Episode 1995)",Not Meant to be a Season Finale,"It's OK.
Yes, Tuvok is kind of a jerk at the beginning, but he's a Vulcan, and they're not exactly known for their social skills. And, yes, the crew members he's training don't want to be part of Starfleet, but they're in a position where they don't have much choice. They're part of a crew whose members have to rely on one another. Keeping a massive chip on their shoulders isn't going to help anyone. I wanted to slap the ""leader"". Granted, he's had awful things occur in his past, but his attitude could get others killed. Just shut up and get on with it, dude! Grow up!
BTW, this was originally supposed to be a midseason episode, which is why it doesn't work as a season finale.",4
6,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Learning Curve (TV Episode 1995)",Star Trek: Voyager - Learning Curve,"Although I do think ""Learning Curve"" is a good episode of the show, it doesn't exactly serve as maybe a memorable means to close the official first season of ""Voyager"". Just the same, as a Tuvok episode, it fits the bill nicely, I thought. Any chance to introduce conflict in the typical logic-based (and rigid Starfleet) philosophy of Vulcan Tuvok, I think it proves to be worthwhile. Though the results of this episode were never in doubt (it proves to chart a predictable path where those opposing Tuvok eventually see past the rules and regulations expected when wearing that uniform and why they must adhere to the demands of operating a Federation starship in the unknown quadrant of an uncharted galaxy), the subplot involving cheese causing an infection that is shutting down the Voyager's operating systems is more of a joke that is far from the most thought-provoking or compelling a season close could expect. Poor Neelix never had a clue his cooking of this cheese would cause the ship to face dire malfunctions possibly even shutting down life supportbut Torres does a good job of easing his conscience. ""Get the cheese to the sickbay!"" Maquis officers having a hard time adapting to Federation protocols are selected for training with Tuvok to get them up to speed with patterns of behavior and action as Starfleet officers; Dalby (Armand Schultz; who I thought was especially good), especially borders on insubordinate with Tuvok who takes him to task over how he ""fixes things"" without consulting with superiors, operating more as a Maquis than Federation officer. Dalby's aggressive behavior and hardly-concealed anger (he hates the Cardassians for a nasty, sexually violent incident involving a woman he loved, admittedly joining the Maquis to kill as many of them as possible) stems from a tough past, and he's protective of Gerron (Kenny Morrison), who is riddled with insecurity and low self esteem, also having endured much during his short adult life. Included is a chatty, lazy, and defensive Chell (Derek McGrath) and defiant, resistant Mariah (Catherine MacNeal) as other Maquis crewmembers needing a lesson in working together, obedience, following orders, and understanding the duty of a Starfleet officer. Chell is quite a hoot as the chatterbox always disrupting others while they are talking and unyielding in his defense of every action and reaction committed by him.The holodeck training program involving a rescue mission interrupted by Romulan warbirds coming out of cloak where the officers fail in what appears to be an unwinnable situation is always a fascinating determination of what those facing such seemingly inescapable odds might try, and Tuvok's response, understanding that retreat might have been an option, with the Maquis mentality in full effect for his trainees unwilling to see that as an option, produces reflection for the Vulcan on what he might should do to improve his standing with them. Neelix using flowers to emphasize what Tuvok might want to consider in reaching them proves that the unlikeliest of sources of advice that can make all the differenceNeelix proves to be an invaluable character, much in the same way Guinan was on the Next Generation.Intense performance from Schultz as Dalby, not the easiest student to cultivate into a Starfleet officer; nonetheless, Dalby sees that Tuvok is more than capable of seeing beyond the logic, understanding that ""bending the rules"" can be necessary. The incident trapping them in a cargo bay, initiating an escape plan offers a chance for Tuvok to prove his meddle as a leader, willing to risk his life for one of them. The pool hologram sequence between Dalby and Tuvok sets the stage for exactly why they are at odds...it is a quality character scene showing that Tuvok is trying to reach out and understand.",7

We soon learn that this was all part of the plan to give them full access to the cube and that they have been inoculated so they won't become part of the collective for a few hours. As their deadline approaches Tuvok finds himself being drawn into the collective. When the virus is released it has the desired effect; freeing members of Unimatrix Zero from the collective. By the time this has been done however Tuvok has been assimilated and the other two are captured. In an effort to force Janeway to tell her how to cure the virus the Borg Queen shows her just how far she will go to kill off the freed drones leaving Janeway with a dilemma.Season Seven certainly got off to a good start with plenty of action, an interesting moral dilemma for the captain and a surprise or two that I won't spoil here.

She is really an individual, thinking pretty much for herself. When she is in combat with Janeway, it appears that her reasons are personal. She is at the center in decision making, hence, individual. This is a good episode with a lot of close calls. One advantage is that the Borg have enemies throughout the galaxy, and so finding comrades is not so hard. One problem with this series is the Doctor's ability to seemingly come up with devices and substances to counter almost anything.",9

In episode one, Voyager learns that there is a virtual world called Unimatrix One where a small number of Borg drones can somehow live during their time recharging in the alcove. In other words, during these sleeping hours, they live as non-drones in a happy world. Because they have individuality during this time, the Borg queen ain't happy and is determined to find this place and wipe everyone out.By this episode, Voyager is not only encouraging the drones in Unimatrix One but is trying to find a way to get the drones to become individuals during waking hours as well. That way the hive can be destabliized. However, Janeway isn't content with JUST destabilization--she's hoping that they can destroy this hive. To do so, she and some other crew members allow themselves to join the Collective! How can they do this and maintain their individuality? See the show...and the thrilling finale.Excellent. Violent, creative and deliciously evil--this one is a show to see!",10
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Unimatrix Zero: Part II (TV Episode 2000)",A Borg Civil War,"Beta Borg Queen Suzanna was the happiest Borg Queen of them all, she has successfully assimilated not only Kathryn Janeway but B'Elanna Torres and Tuvok to boot.So why can't she hear these valuable new acquisitions? She had monologued in the Cliffhanger of the last episode that she expected something ""More Cunning"" from Janeway.Well, if she knew what Janeway was really up to, she would have been satisfied. Janeway had found a way to be assimilated but keep her Hooman Identity intact and avoid being sucked into the Collective.Because Janeway, Tuvok and B'Elanna had been ""Assimilated for Bear"", each of them containing NanoViruses that will hide all of the Borg with the Mutation that allows them to get into Unimatrix Zero. Their Goal? Just walk right into the Central Plexus and use The Borg's own Assimilation Tubules to inject the NanoVirus into the Plexus.And it works great, except for this one flaw: They did not give Tuvok enough of the Dope that is preventing the three of them from being completely assimilated.Big Problem, Suzie-Queen can now hear Tuvok, and has his Tactical Access Codes to Voyager.Meanwhile Seven of Inverted-Nine-and-Nine goes back to Unimatrix Zero to monitor when the NanoVirus is dispersed. She had found out that she had been part of Unimatrix Zero for 19 years, six of them in an Intimate Relationship with Axum. This makes her uncomfortable and difficult to do her Job, Chakotay has to order her to go in there and set that difficulty aside.Starfleet has No Tolerance for interpersonal Problems- This is not the first time a Crew Person has been Ordered to do their Job despite not liking it. If The Senate in 2013 had been Starfleet Officers, they never would have tried to shut down the Government, holding the entire government Hostage. Can you imagine if the Maquis Members of Voyager's Crew had decided to perform a ""Voyager Shut-Down?"" - Janeway would have hung each of them from the Highest Yardarm (Or Starboard Engine Nacelle).So Seven sets her discomfort aside and gets involved with the people in Unimatrix Zero, helping them set Traps for Unwelcome Drones, and even falls into one of Axum's Traps. This was the perfect thing to happen, it forced Annika Hansen aka Seven to face the subject of her discomfort: Axum (Mark Deakins who does a lot of memorable work for LDS).She even gets Korok interacting and cooperating with the rest of the members of Unimatrix, and Korok gives Bat'Tehl's to whoever wants to try using them. Axum was given a nice, spiky club that would also do the trick.Janeway is successful in planting the NanoVirus, but not before Tuvok is assimilated, and gives Beta Queen their access codes, Voyager has to Haul Arse out of there in short order.And the Queen now sees the Virus and Mutates it to backfire, intending to plant it right into Unimatrix Zero, killing all of the Matrix Drones.So Janeway is forced to ""Compromise"" to Suzanna Queen, and tells Chakotay that ""Unimatrix Zero must not exist""- This secret Message goes over Suzanna's Head.And Voyager has some unlikely Help: It appears that Korok's Sphere is near Voyager, between his Sphere and Voyager, they destroy Unimatrix Zero and The Queen's opportunity to kill them all.But now, the Drones can remember who they were in Unimatrix Zero, and The only way for The Queen to eradicate these drones is to destroy the entire collective.Annika/Seven and Axum have a parting Scene, she will never meet him because he in in a Ship orbiting Fluidic Space in the Beta Quadrant. But Janeway's s parting words to B-Queen are ""I Don't compromise with Borg"".Mark Deakins is also in ""Star Trek: Insurrection"" - He is on a Roof yelling out some instructions while Picard evacuates a Baku Village.",10
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Imperfection (TV Episode 2000)",Seven Of Nine faces death.,"Voyager. Season 7, Episode 2. ""Imperfection"" Seven Of Nine faces death.Absolutely superb.There are many, many things to love here.1. Most of the screen time is devoted to the show's three best characters: Seven, Janeway and The Doctor. But it's not just that they get lots of screen time, it's that they get lots of good screen time. For instance, there's a wonderful, emotional moment between Janeway and Seven that is a huge step forward in their relationship/friendship (and it's perfectly played by Jeri Ryan and the amazing Kate Mulgrew). Impossible to watch this exchange and not feel tears forming. And it's a scene that is typical of many in the story.2. It's an emotional episode, all round. Seven's scene with Janeway is probably the best, but the final scene with Icheb is also a killer and the scene with B'Elanna is another one likely to generate a tear or two. And there's more. It's a very powerful episode, very sad and affecting. Uplifting and wonderful in the way that this show frequently is. Voyager's skill, indeed the gift that the Star Trek legacy gives it, is the ability to write on-the-nose about big topics and make it palatable. Seven might die. And it gives her pause to think and, eventually, talk about it. And it's epic stuff.3. There's some cool Janeway action. The episode (wisely) takes a break from all the stuff likely to make you cry and drops Janeway, Tuvok and Paris into the middle of a battle where Janeway jumps an imposing alien and holds him at gunpoint (sorta). It's fun stuff. Typical of Janeway when she chooses to wear her bad ass hat.4. It's funny. After seven seasons is there any need to say it? But, anyway... Robert Picardo is worth his weight in gold. Many of The Doctor's utterance's are hilarious. Usually, in scenes with Seven e.g. Seven's joke about her 'last meal'.5. The core values of Star Trek are in display in spades, here. Janeway's attempt to head off on a dangerous mission alone is scuppered by Tuvok and Paris in fine style, and once again we see that these people are a team through and through.6. Manu Intiraymi is a curious performer. Sometimes I find his delivery stilted and over-earnest. Yet, in all the scenes where it really mattered he totally nailed it. Totally. All his scenes from the last third of the episode are A+ material. It's taken 5 episodes, but I really like the guy now.ABriefingWithMichael.blogspot.com",10
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Imperfection (TV Episode 2000)",Excellent Acting/Touching Episode,"This is a really touching episode. The unflappable Seven is suddenly made aware of her mortality. She begins to have fears of leaving the earth unloved and worthless. Ichab is her salvation, but unfortunately she has quite the ego and falls into depression. For all practical purposes, she gives up. She can't ask for help because her Borg heritage is still holding on to her. The final scenes are very dramatic and uplifting.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Imperfection (TV Episode 2000)",Awfully good.,"This episode makes very good use of the Borg kids--specifically Icheb. When the show begins, one more of the Borg kiddies is reunited with their parents and Seven is seen crying. Unfortunately it's NOT because of a sudden appearance of emotion but because an important part of Seven's Borg implants is malfunctioning. It's a problem because without it, she will die. An attempt to replace it with a Borg node doesn't work so there is only one possible option--but the Doctor and Seven are loathe to try it. Icheb offers to give her his node. This probably won't kill him, as apparently he wasn't fully assimilated since he's a kid and his body SHOULD be able to survive without it. This is a very emotional and enjoyable show. I liked the moral quandary in this one and the show is quite memorable.",9

Initially Seven wants the Doctor to keep her problem secret but when she collapses it becomes apparent that her cortical node is failing and that if it isn't replaced she will die. Not being able to replicate the part Janeway leads an away mission in the recently repaired Delta Flyer to a destroyed Borg cube to retrieve the part from a dead drone. Unfortunately simulations show that the part is of no use and they need the part from a live Borg. When a possible solution is suggested neither Seven nor the Doctor are initially enthusiastic.While not as exciting as the season opener this episode had a good action scene where the captain retrieves the part of the dead drone and some nice moral ambiguity when Janeway suggests finding a live drone and taking its node.",7
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Drive (TV Episode 2000)",A good idea that suffers from choppy presentation...,"(SPOILERS) The idea of a ""race in space"" has never been introduced in the Star Trek Universe before, and so there was great opportunity in ""Drive"" for a truly exciting and unique Trek adventure. Unfortunately, the end result, while not terrible, falls far short of its potential.The main fault seems to be too many subplots (the race, warring factions & sabotage, AND Tom & B'Elanna's relationship problems), which require the viewer to constantly jump from one to another to the extent that one feels almost as if one is watching three different episodes at the same time instead of just one. In trying to be many things, ""Drive"" fails to by any ONE thing, and so the show ends up with a ""choppy"" and jumbled feel to it.I, for one, would have loved to have seen more emphasis on the race itself- the individual racers, the bizarre vehicles they were piloting, the potential unknown hazards along the race course, etc. (The pod race in ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" (1999) is a great example of how visually interesting- not to mention fun & exciting- a multiple species space race can be).Finally, I was rather disappointed that a major Star Trek Voyager event- the marriage of Tom Paris & B'Elanna Torres- happened off screen and was somewhat haphazardly tacked on at the very end! What's up with that? One would think that the marriage of these two major characters would deserve at least a token amount of screen time.Perhaps ""Drive"" would have worked better with a little more ""breathing space""- as a two part story arc, there would have been more time to explore & develop all the subplots. As it stands, it seems a little rushed & out of focus.",5

She informs him that her race and three others are having a big race to celebrate peace--and Paris is welcome to join in if he'd like. However, selfish Tom totally forgets that he's been promising B'Elanna for ages that he'd take her to the holodeck for a little vacation! Oops. This sort of thoughtlessness gets B'Elanna wondering if she really should remain with the man- child, Tom.Talk about light-weight plots! A race?! Still, it plays reasonably well but ends on a very unhappy ending--B'Elanna agrees to actually marry that schmuck! But I DID like the final scene of them in the shuttle--it's kind of cute.",6

One person who is not so pleased is B'Elanna who had been looking forward to a holodeck holiday with Tom which she had spent some time arranging. Trying to save their relationship she persuades Harry to let her take his place in the race. After an audacious manoeuvre the Delta Flyer finishes the first stage in the lead although it might have caused an accident that injured Irina's copilot. It turned out it wasn't the Flyer that caused the accident but an act of sabotage. In the final leg Harry takes over as Irina's copilot largely because he has a bit of a crush on her. Once again something goes wrong with her ship and Harry realises why; she sabotaged it herself so that she would be well away from the finish line when the other ship she sabotaged exploded... that other ship being the Delta Flyer.This wasn't a bad episode and I enjoyed the idea of the Flyer taking part in a race it could have given us excitement without an antagonist or great peril; it was a pity that instead we got a clichéd plot featuring sabotage, it was also a bit of a shame that during what should have been an exciting climax we got a rather soapy scene between Tom and B'Elanna. The final scene where we see the words ""Just Married"" written on the Delta Flyer was pretty corny but earned a chuckle.",6

Tuvok who is in charge of the investigation makes a starling discovery; it turns out that the assailant had no idea that he was responsible, a message from home had triggered mind control programming which had been initiated years ago in the Alpha Quadrant. As the victims begin to wake from their comas and hear a trigger phase they seize control of the ship with the intention of abandoning the Star Fleet crew on a nearby planet; will any of them manage to break their programming before it is too late.I liked how this episode changed as it went along, I was expecting it to be a simple whodunit but we learnt who was responsible about half way through.

On the holodeck. The irony is not lost on B'Lanna, who comments that it seems silly to watch two-dimensional technology using three-dimensional holographic equipment. Not seems, Mrs. Paris, IS. IS SILLY. The most sophisticated entertainment system ever created, and little Tommy Paris uses it to watch 400-year-old movies. That's like using my playstation to watch...well, nothing, because entertainment wasn't even invented until the 20th century.Back to Voyager - seems as if someone is attacking seemingly random crew people until it's revealed that it's not random, there's a pattern - they're all former Maquis! Hey, remember that thing that stopped being an issue in Season One? Nope, me either.It's been SEVEN YEARS. Why bother reminding the audience of a storyline so long-abandoned, so mundane, even the characters didn't care about it anymore?Somehow it's revealed that the Bajoran witch doctor is some kind of Dr. Mindbender, who did a bunch of experiments on Tuvok because he was jealous that the Maquis kicked him out of their club. What?! Why does any of this matter? Seven years ago, it might have mattered. This feels like another ""Friday Before A Holiday Weekend"" episode, where the writers just found whatever resembled a story and made them shoot it the next week.Shameful. Anyway, the Bajoran has been using Tuvok to mind-meld with the Maquis people, of which Chakotay states is about 1/4 of Voyager's crew. On the high side, Voyager has 150 crew people, so that makes around 32 Maquis. After Tuvok's mind-melds, all of the FORMER Maquis (because remember, THIS DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE) become all crazy mind-controlled and stage an insurrection, taking over Voyager. Why? Why is any of this happening? Turns out no one knows or cares. Best part? When Evil Maquis Chakotay tells Evil Maquis Tuvok that they still had around 21 of their people who didn't get the mind-meld, so they can't help. 21 of 32 are not helping them. That leaves 11. Eleven former Maquis took over all of Voyager without any pushback. More than 11 people get sick after eating Neelix's cooking on a nightly basis.All this stupidity ends when Janeway tells Tuvok to remember who he is, and then he does and something happens, the end.Just a dumb, dumb, useless episode. Which is a shame, because it started out really great with a Ten Little Indians kind of feel with the crew getting attacked one at a time.Eleven people. Give me a break. They even changed out of their Starfleet uniforms after they took over the ship. So, outmatched around 12-1, the Maquis jerkwads find a way to take the ship and stop by their apartments to change their clothes in the process.Poo.

Why? What is the ultimate goal? This is a pretty good episode overall. However, I did laugh when Tom Paris and the crew were all doing a recreation night where they sat and watched 3-D movies from the 1950s. This technology was CRAP and it's funny that the writer of the show didn't realize that the 3-D films which would come only a decade after the show aired actually DID look 3-D.

She agrees to a quick talk and comes to the conclusion that Reg might be right about the program being stolen when he mentions having had a girl friend who left him just after the hologram's program was lost. It turns out she was working for a group of Ferengis who are trying to get their hands on Seven of Nine's nanoprobes. The crew of Voyager are mostly oblivious that they are about to get killed meaning Reg must persuade the Ferengis to collapse the fold before Voyager can enter it.Initially I thought I wouldn't enjoy this episode as the Holographic Reg was so extremely confident as to be annoying but it is explained well enough. It was a nice twist to have the Ferengis be the antagonists rather than anybody Reg initially suspected. There was some humour thrown in, the best being when Harry is shown to be gullible.. again.",8

However, what no one on Voyager realizes is that he is also something else....EVIL!!!

The Doctor bonds too quickly with the killer holos and starts to over-identify with them. As a result, he's become more of a liability than an asset.

We also get to see old enemies who have been absent for several seasons... I think the past adversaries were my favorite parts! My only complaint about this episode is we do not see Kess.There was a lengthy part in the middle dealing with ""Captain Proton"". It seemed like it was meant to be comical, but it wasn't very funny, IMHO. If you are anything like me, then when watching this part you had the same attitude as Cpt.

I did not feel like going through another round of Telanna fights. However by the end of the episode I was impressed by how they both have seemed to have grown and show that they care for one another more openly. Not only that, but this episode was constructed in such a way in that really pulled you into the characters' plight.When someone becomes a parent, they are often reminded of what they went through as a child. This happened with B'Elanna, and we were given a little more insight into why she hated being Klingon so much. While she did get teased a little, it was her interpretation of her father's departure being not only her fault directly for telling him to leave, but indirectly her and her mother's fault for being Klingon and too difficult to live with, as she overheard him complain about them.This whole portrayal was very realistic, minus the Klingons! It is very common for adults to still harbor illogical beliefs that surface when things happen to them as children exactly like this.In the end, you really felt B'Elanna's pain when she finally confessed all of this to Tom. Tom did a stellar job in comforting her and putting her fears to rest. I was impressed by both of them in this scene so far as being mature characters in a relationship. Due to their acting in this sequence, it was highly believable and moving. Also, knowing these events made B'Elanna's actions in the past when she denied her heritage a little more understandable.The episode ended on a very feel-good note when B'Elanna finally accepted her child as part Klingon and gave the most realistic heartfelt smile I have seen her give in the series.The idea of genetic manipulation arose as well. This is a timeless issue, and it was interesting to hear the arguments. There were comparisons made about how is it okay to correct one defect, but not another? As genetic manipulation becomes more realistic in future years, we may be revisiting these issues.",

Here, a child is in the offing, and the responses are at best silly, from them and from the crew. B'Ellana's confrontation with her father and her guilt are at the center here. That's interesting, but her initial ""persecution"" seems slightly less than overwhelming. It's OK I guess. Mostly, I was hoping for something else to happen outside of this story.",7

You are wrong. She was not pregnant in season 7. In 2 episodes of season 7 (Author, Author and Renaissance Man) you can clearly see that a holographic version of her character is not pregnant.Dawson was pregnant in season 4. But it wasn't written into the script then. They had her character wear a smock/jacket over her uniform.I truly liked this episode. Because I felt it dealt with real life issues such as childhood abandonment by a parent and being bullied as a child and how these things affect a person. Both of these things happen to the character as a child. She thinks that she wants to spare her child that. But it's also that she doesn't want to be abandoned again.",8
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Lineage (TV Episode 2001)",Identity,"Lineage, a heart felt well written episode, deals with the relationship between B'Elanna's Klingon and Human background. The episode written by James Kahn, writer of the ""Return of the Jedi"" novel, is not only applicable to contemporary life issues, but works with the 24th century world in Voyager. Identity issues are common in today's world and fictionally in the inter-species world of Star Trek. I think that some Trek fans forget that Gene Roddenberry's original vision was not just of a fictional, Scifi world, but a world that relates 24th century life to 20/21st century life. A vision that is both far reaching and grand, yet grounded in contemporary society, 'Lineage' lives up to that vision.",10

When the show begins, B'Elanna finds out that she is pregnant. However, instead of being overjoyed, she is full of doubts and self-loathing. As a result of her terrible childhood and daddy abandonment issues, instead of being happy she's worried to death that the child will look Klingon and will feel left out when dealing with its peers. This IS odd considering how politically correct and nice everyone is during the 24th century--it's just hard to imagine any of the kids during this time not being 100% p.c.. But her concerns run much deeper--making her behave and think VERY irrationally.At first, I didn't care for the episode. However, over time I started to appreciate B'Elanna's character and her struggles. All in all an interesting show--one well worth seeing.",8
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Lineage (TV Episode 2001)",Well intentioned but forgettable episode...,"The famous motivational speaker Zig Zigler has a great expression for people & projects that start out with the best of intentions but soon pan out to nothing of significance...he calls it ""squatting to rise (up), but getting cooked in the squat"". ""Lineage"" does this very thing...it starts out with good possibilities, but falls flat very soon.Its failure has nothing to do with the energy of the actors- all the regulars give it their best effort, in particular Robert Duncan McNeill & Roxann Dawson, who turn in perhaps their most emotionally charged performances of the entire series. Rather, the major faults here include poor writing and poor guest star casting.With respect to writing, the plot moves at a snail's pace, with little or no action, and very little humorous interplay to fill this void. And the plot holes make the Grand Canyon look like a drainage ditch. In a series franchise like Star Trek that has time and time again passionately preached the message that ALL life is sacred, special, and worthy just as it is, B'Elanna attempts to have her baby surgically altered by using unethical and illegal means (commondeering ship systems, locking out Voyager's security team, reprogramming the Doctor) and yet she is not punished or reprimanded in any way.And, speaking of which, what ABOUT that very sneaky trick of diabolically altering the Doctor's program to make him an unwitting accomplice to an ""ethnic cleansing"" of the unborn child? True, she does apologize to him, but in the ""respect everyone's individual rights at all times"" world of Star Trek, shouldn't the consequences of her dangerous actions be a little more severe than her mild embarrassment at having to apologize to him? Finally, poor guest star casting makes the situation worse. The actor cast as B'Elanna's father is just too wimpy too be believable..he's a good actor, but he is simply the wrong choice for the part. We're supposed to believe that this rather effeminate & ""milk-toasty"" guy won the admiration of...and married.. a KLINGON woman? He seems more suited to play the mild-mannered Dad on some Nickelodeon show or perhaps The Disney Channel, not the husband of a woman from an aggressive warrior race that values strength and power above all else.The story and end result here mirrors many of Voyager's Seventh Season installments- good concept, but poor execution.",3
6,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Lineage (TV Episode 2001)",An issue of the week episode,"There have been several episodes of Voyager which have dealt with B'Elanna's Klingon heritage, some of these are good, others less so; sadly this is not so good. When B'Elanna discovers that she is pregnant the Doctor tells her that the baby has something wrong with her spine. He solves this with a simply genetic treatment. This gets B'Elanna thinking, perhaps she could get the Doctor to perform further treatments so that her child will not have Klingon features and will thus avoid the bullying she suffered as a child. Her husband Tom and The Doctor are both horrified at the idea of performing such a procedure but B'Elanna takes drastic measures to persuade the Doctor to do it.The story wasn't too bad but it did feel like an ""issue of the week"" episode where it was clear that we were meant to think B'Elanna was making the wrong decision but doing so for good reasons. There was far less excitement than in most episodes, in fact apart there was never any feeling of threat. I have nothing against character led episodes but this felt like it was going over old ground as it has been made clear many times before that B'Elanna has issues concerning her Klingon heritage.",7
7,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Lineage (TV Episode 2001)",Wrong-itty-Wrong-Wrong-Wrong,"Garbage...Trash....Flotsam.This episode was seemingly written by a 4 year old child. It has so many inconsistencies based on childrearing in the 24th century that it is pretty much ridiculous. I will now reveal to you the source of the inconsistency which forces each ST series to falter by season 7: ""Writers of the Week"" fill the bulk of the 170+ episodes in all the Star Trek series' since TNG. These writers, sideline fans seeking pay, are terrible at keeping consistency to the storyline or the universe in general. Take this episode for example ( although it is not alone by a long shot ) ...it's complete garbage. The flashbacks of B'elanna's past are filmed with such painfully bad actors that they are basically unbelievable and nigh unwatchable. Notice how all the good Voyager Episodes are written by Brannon Braga? The good writers come up with the show and make usually the pilots and cliffhangers ( beginning and ends of each season with a mid-season cliffhanger as well) all the other episodes are written by these hack ""writers of the week."" In the Star Trek universe, all, ALL crewmen and officers are sterilized (thru injections administered by the doctor as part of their medical regimen (checkups)) unless express permission to procreate is given by the captain, which in this case would never happen. Do you think Voyager could run for several months without a chief engineer? Answer, NO. Thus she would never let this happen. Secondly, Genetic Modification of ANY sort is expressly ILLEGAL in the Star Trek universe as was laid out for us (long before this series/episode came out that's for sure) in DS9 with the antics of our beloved genetically superior Dr. Bashir. Thirdly, no officers shall fraternize with another member of the crew. Fraternization leads to conflict of interest. Could B'elanna order Tom Paris to his death if necessary? They prevent fraternization for this very reason. An emotional wife is not going to send her husband to his death even if it costs the crew of 145 their lives. So besides being a complete waste of film, this episode was terribly written and inconsistency is the rule of the day. It's episodes like this that ruin the whole, they aren't just filler, they are rotten apples ruining the rest of the bunch. Please, if you ever make another ST series, and I believe you will with the coming tsunami that is the new Star Trek movie ( 2009 ), write the entire thing before the first episode is shot a la Babylon 5. Take a lesson from the pros. Get a real set of writers and stick with them. Sign contracts. Make them study and watch each episode of Star Trek from front to back and hell, create a rules handbook for writing ST episodes so that they don't make stupid mistakes. More importantly though, no one would agree to travel for 3 generations in a starship just to get home. They would land on the best class-M planet they could find and live there, creating a colony and hoping one day the Federation would come along. First and foremost, these ships are run by people. People with their own agendas, not just Starfleets. Are we to believe that these people just work every day for the rest of their lives? Even excessive amounts of shore leave and all the holodeck time in the world couldn't make these officers stay aboard. From the beginning Voyager was a bad concept. Don't get me wrong, it turned out OK... I LOVE the Doctor, but still...things like this should never go forward again. If I was the executive funding this giant I sure wouldn't put my life in the hands of ""writers of the week"" or certainly not this weak concept for a ST series.Rest assured, if the Star Trek Universe were real this episode would never of happened. Knowing that the STU is NOT real, this episode still should never have happened. Wonderfully convenient way to cover up Roxanne Dawson's pregnancy, though. Couldn't she wait one more year to procreate? Contracts people. Contracts. These episodes were filmed at a cost in excess of a million dollars an episode. Over the 170 episode series it cost them in excess of 170 million dollars to film Voyager. Don't let a rogue actress get in the way of all that money I say... This is business. They certainly built the Juggernaut that should have been Voyager on a foundation of sand.",3

This episode could be analogously about an ethnic minority human mother, attempting to genetically modify her child, to avoid persecution, then being talked out of it by low tech people of religious faith. A Human/Klingon hybrid would take massive amounts of genetic engineering to achieve The doctor makes ridiculous faith-based statements that Klingon components within B'Ellana's baby are natural. You can almost hear him say that ""God designed the baby this way, who are we to tamper with providence and nice naturalness"". The writer momentarily touches on his hypocrisy in wanting to modify the baby's spine. Unfortunately, one of the bugbears of the Star Trek world is the ridiculous stagnation of humanity and their strange ability to talk to aliens, even when their translator has been taken off them.

Although force fields are certainly more ""high tech"" (and allow a better view of the guest star prisoners for the television audience), from a practical standpoint they make no sense at all. Force fields require constant power, maintenance, and are always at risk of disappearing during a power failure (which is exactly what happens here, allowing the prisoners to escape and wreak havoc).Even in the advanced 24th century, wouldn't just plain old fashioned steel bars be much better for confining prisoners? They are relatively cheap, easy to install, require no maintenance or power source, and won't disappear during a power failure. Just a thought.......",9

One of the prisoners, Iko, manages to take Seven hostage in sick bay but he is soon recaptured and sent to the makeshift holding cells that have been constructed in one of the cargo bays. When serving the food another prisoner tells Neelix how their system of justice is highly biased; his minority race making up the majority of the prison population and even when the majority race is convicted they get lesser sentences. After Iko is badly beaten by the guards Janeway insists that only Star Fleet security will act as guards. Iko is taken back to sick bay where the Doctor treats him with Seven's nanoprobes, after this treatment his personality is radically changed and for the first time he feels guilt for the crimes he has committed. Later on when a Voyager is attacked and the prisoners escape it is Iko who saves his captor.I felt this episode was trying to say something about the US penal system with one minority being over represented in the prisons but later on it is shown that most of the prisoners were guilty as charged and willing to manipulate the sympathetic for their own ends. Perhaps showing two conflicting arguments and lettering the viewer decide is the best way to air an issue.",8

Should we now execute the body when the mind is completely overhauled? It's an incredibly hard one to answer. I guess what we fall back on is the chances of such an event occurring are infinitesimal.

In order to further fulfil the prophecy they destroy their ship forcing Janeway to beam all two hundred of them to Voyager. Once over many of them believe that B'Elanna can't be the mother of the one spoken of in the prophecy as she is only half Klingon, the fact that the baby's father is human makes things even worse.

Feeling that the prophecy can't have been fulfilled a group of the Klingon's attempt to take Voyager.This was a fairly good episode of Voyager which contains both action and some comedy. It was funny to see Harry attempting to get away from Klingon woman with romantic intentions and Neelix helping Harry by getting the woman for himself. There have been plenty of episodes where B'Elanna has been forced to deal with her Klingon heritage, thankfully it wasn't overplayed here despite her being seen as the mother of their saviour.

Brown) beams over.These Refuges from Qo'NoS have been traveling for generations looking for ""The Kuvamagh"" - Some kind of Klingon Messiah, so they pick B'Elanna's unborn child to be this god!Suddenly, 200 Klingons are all over Voyager cos they blew up their ship. This Kohlar is the epitome of an Evangelical, Charismatic Preacher, even talks like one. Kind of sounds like The Sisko in that regard.Actually I liked it, a full Klingon that spoke like Martin Luther King. But Kohlar's side-kick ""T'Greth"" (Sherman Howard) has a smaller Faith than Kohlar's - At least in Appearance.Because as Kohlar orally and Visibly seems to expound a full Faith in his Klingon Religion, he actually just wants an End to the Wandering.It was convenient they came across the One Ship in the Delta Quadrant with at least one partially Klingon Crewoman who had been knocked up during the one month that the Kuvamagh was supposed to be conceived.So it seems that with Kohlar, in Losing his Faith, he found it. But this must needs be tested. T'Greth challenges Paris to a duel to the death, which Janeway immediately intervenes in to make it potentially less bloody.But these Klingons are all infected with ""The Tourette Syndrome"" and it infects B'Elanna and her Baby. T'Greth see this as yet another shortcoming with their new ""'IHrIStoS ngan voDleH"" and moves to take over Voyager. Fast thinking by Tuvok and Janeway prevent this, giving the Doctor the time he needs to find a cure for Tourette Syndrome.And it is all in B'Elanna's Child's Split Heritage Stem Cells. So they have found their Saviour after all.There is a little Side-Comedy when a large and beautiful Klingon Woman ""Ch'Rega"" (Peggy Jo Jacobs) gets infatuated with Harry - Aw, C'Mon Harry, this would have made up for ""Seven"" Years of falling for the Wrong Borg! But he's too Chicken, whereas Neelix is not!I'll say this about Neelix, that man can ADAPT. It seems he is another like Dax from Deep Space Nine, who although not a Klingon understands what a Klingon is and loves it. This is probably his finest moment on Voyager.Faith and Comedy, kind of an unusual mixture of concepts, but not too far fetched, because it is Faith that makes us believe in Trek just as much as it is Faith that drives our belief in The Prophets.Ironically, although this is a Fiction, this is precisely how Faith is. Faith is not the Blind following of one's Religion, it's when a person believes in where that Religion will take them, and sometimes we do things in frustration with that Faith that are the exact Steps we should take - In this story, Kohlar's frustration and seeking to end his ship's wandering - Or rather, his giving up - Was the very thing that brought him to his personal Goal. That is how Faith Works. It is not by blindly following a book of Rules, but by knowing in your Heart what is right, and sometimes that means going against what is written in the Rulebook.",10
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Prophecy (TV Episode 2001)",Not bad..but certainly a wasted opportunity...,"A fairly entertaining Season 7 installment- with a particularly funny subplot involving Neelix & an amorous Kilingon woman- but the rest is rather mediocre.The appearance of Klingons in ANY Star Trek show always brings the promise of high drama, action, and adventure...unfortunately here, the promise isn't kept. This particular episode features the Klingons spending much more time in staff meetings than in battle or in conflict.The plot moves along quite slowly. A great opportunity to explore a very old Klingon battle cruiser from Captain Kirk's(!) era is squandered early, and the main ""action"" of the piece..a battle showdown between Tom Paris and an aggressive Klingon challenger...is devoid of any real drama because all the actors- including Robert Duncan McNeill- are so nonchalant about it that no dramatic tension has a chance to build, and so we never really feel that Tom is ever in any danger or at risk at any time (which one would ordinarily expect when one is forced to fight an angry Klingon).The ""poor casting"" gremlin that seems to haunt Voyager's last two seasons strikes again here with the casting of Wren T. Brown as the Klingon leader Kohlar. Although a competent actor who turns in a sincere performance, Mr. Brown lacks the Klingon ""edginess""- (the simmering and chilling threat of barely restrained aggression that could burst forth at any moment)- that the best Klingon actors in Star Trek possess (Michael Dorn, Robert O'Reilly, Christoper Lloyd, Christoper Plummer, etc.) Mr. Brown's portrayal is quiet, subdued, polite, and soft spoken- not threatening at all, and certainly not Klingon. It should be noted that two of Mr. Brown's previous roles include a turn as Whoopi Goldberg's comic relief brother in Whoopi"" (2003-2004) and as a reoccurring character in ""The New Adventures of Flipper"" (1995). Hmmmm...I rest my case on the casting issue.Not the worst Voyager adventure by any means, but don't expect to be on the edge of your seat during this one..rather, you're more likely to be comfortably settled in it and possibly dozing off from time to time.",5

Its interesting to see B'Ellana's embarrassment at having all these 'musky' Klingons around. The part about the musk is funny. I like how Voyager puts them in their place, by using the sensors to see through the cloak and disabling them easily.

However, in this episode she delivers a brilliant performance. She demonstrates toughness in a very natural manner by showing confidence and leadership and having the big picture and imposing this view on a crew who are clearly overwhelmed by their seemingly hopeless circumstance. This was by far her best performance, she faces down Tuvok, Chakotay, and 7/9 who wanted to adopt a more barbaric strategy of survival by telling them at key moments, 'does it really matter if we last 7 days instead of 2?' Janeway didn't just spout federation rules, instead she dug deeper into the concepts to see why they work and how they can be applied even here.

Voyager's Supplies get swiped within seconds, and then the ship that had swiped the goodies gets vaporized by a ship of a guy named ""Valen"" (Babylon 5's Robin Sachs), who now has all of Voyager's Deuterium and some of their food.There is also a new Race, designed from Doctor Seuss characters, the main one played by Jonathan Del Arco who was ""Hugh Borg"" in Next Generation, his character in this is ""Fantome"" - Named by The Doctor for ""Phantom of The Opera""- They appear to be natural citizens of this part of non-space, they can hide themselves, and they can speak by chirping on Padds after The Doc shows them how.Where one ship cannot even come close to escaping this crappy area, several ships in tandem could, but this is a lawless area where personal morals need not seem to apply.Nevertheless, Janeway enforces Starfleet Principles and forms a small Alliance with some other stranded ships.But one of these ""allies' is a Beak-Faced Jerk named ""Bosaal"" (Michael Shamus Wiles who was a similar creep and cretin in The X-Files), who will not adhere to the standards that Janeway has set for behavior, he keeps attacking other ships so Janeway kicks his Beakfaced Buttocks out of the alliance, leaving them with only 4 ships total.The Googys, who are natural born Peeping Toms and Spies, spy on Bosaal and find out he is gonna attack with Valen, So Janeway elicits Help from the Dr Seuss Aliens to make it all backfire on Bosaal.There is also another pair of ships Captained by the Venture Star Chief from ""Avatar"", Scott Lawrence (""Garon""- He was also in ""Into Darkness"") and he becomes a stolid Janeway supporter - Because he likes Voyager's food more.So it just goes to show that a little Federation Morality will go a long way in getting out of jams. Janeway is kind to a group of Aliens who is kicked around by the other captains, and by saying true to who she is, this little act of kindness goes a long away in saving the butts of Four stranded Ships-And it is all because Seven of Sixty-Nine gives Jon Del Arco her food, shaming Janeway into doing even more for the critters.Ain't it interesting that Valen's ship looks like a Maquis Raider and ""The Nightingale"" that Harry Captained?",10

These ships survive by stealing food, fuel and other necessities from new arrivals. As a new arrival Voyager is quickly targeted and has much of its food and fuel stolen. Another ship offers to help but Captain Janeway declines as its captain wants weaponry in exchange. They search for the ship that robbed them but find it has already been robbed by another ship. They do however find a wounded alien who although initially incapable of communicating manages to learn to communicate with the doctor using tones created by a piece of equipment. In order to try to escape the void Janeway tries to persuade the various other ships to form an alliance so that each can bring their own strengths to the effort.This was a decent episode which saw crew members question their captain's insistence on sticking to Star Fleet protocols even if that means they might not survive; of course ultimately the survive because they stick to their guiding principles. I enjoyed the main story although seeing the aliens chatting with beeping machines soon stopped being enjoyable and felt like it might only appeal to an audience too young to enjoy the series.",8

5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Void (TV Episode 2001)",Not terribly original but likable adventure....,"The ""oh, my, we're trapped in a mysterious dark void with no way out"" concept has been used and reused many times in the Star Trek Universe (ST: Next Generation's Second Season installment ""Where Silence Has Lease"" is a good example that comes to mind) so don't expect any surprises or new territory here....we have seen this all before. This eliminates any suspense from the get go (as does the fact that this is not a two-parter), so we just know from the very beginning that the crew will manage to escape in 60 minutes and that they are never in any real danger.What makes this episode enjoyable, though, is good solid acting and interplay by the regulars and some fun performances by some likable (and not so likable!) guest stars.Not a bad show by any means, but it's a shame this couldn't have been a two parter...this would have helped to build the suspense a bit and also would have provided more time to see & learn more about all the different ships & species trapped in the void, which could have been quite interesting.",7
6,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Void (TV Episode 2001)",Janeway the Gullible Idiot,"For some reason, this episode feels painfully familiar, to a level of staleness that I hadn't realized until remembering it followed the exact same formula as an earlier episode in which Voyager is dragged into an area of space that is essentially a void.This time around, however, the technobabble solution will involve the cooperation of other aliens who have been dragged into this area of space called the Void, where Deuterium is rare, and there are no resources anywhere. The only solution is to steal supplies from other ships drawn into the Void.This, of course, goes against the principles of the Federation, but as we've established from watching seven years of this show, Janeway is a a fanatic who will stick to the Prime Directives even at the cost of her life and everyone else on board Voyager. She even directly states in this episode that she'd rather see the entire crew die rather than resort to becoming ""thieves and murderers""... in a situation where they would only need to become ""thieves""... by taking their supplies back from another thief, along with taking back what was stolen from other vessels.So Janeway is fanatical enough, cold-hearted enough, masochistic enough, and misanthrophic enough to deny her crew the bare necessities of survival if it means bending the rules JUST A LITTLE. She honestly doesn't care if her crew starves to death, so long as they don't steal food from a thief! Remember this, Star Trek viewers: One of the principles of the Prime Directive is for a ship's captain to do everything possible to save their crew, and here's Janeway willing to see them ALL die just to let a THIEF keep his STOLEN GOODS stolen from someone he more than likely KILLED ANYWAY.No matter your moral views on this, you HAVE to acknowledge that when you're lost in the wilderness and food is running out, you can't just risk your crew starving to death just because you'd FEEL BAD ABOUT STEALING FROM A THIEF! This is why Janeway is the absolute worst of all the captains of this era.Picard is someone who follows the Prime Directives, but recognizes that there are situations where it cannot be upheld without causing a severe moral, or even actual dilemma. He breaks the Prime Directives in order to save lives.Sisko is someone who follows the Prime Directives, and also recognizes that situations are not always so clear cut, black and white, and he's willing to break the Prime Directives for a greater good, typically because of his regard for sentient life.Janeway, by comparison, follows the Prime Directives, frequently at the cost of sentient life.So rather than deal with others, she outright REFUSES to deal with ANYONE who in ANYWAY goes against her authoritarian ideals. She forms an alliance with WILLING aliens caught in the Void, then IMPOSES her Federation ideals upon the Alliance. Certain things like not killing or stealing are obvious and easy enough, but it gets to a point where she KICKS OUT an ENTIRE ship because it's captain got components for their warp engine because they traded stolen equipment from a ship they destroyed earlier.And ever the tactless moron, she does this with intense hatred and rancor in her voice and tone and expression that it causes the other alien to GO AND HELP JANEWAY'S ENEMY! AND THE ONLY WAY THEY FIGURE THIS OUT IS BY LISTENING TO A RECORDED CONVERSATION MADE BY ANOTHER ALIEN WHO'S SPYING ON EVERYONE ON THE SHIP---ANOTHER VIOLATION OF THE ALLIANCE'S IDEALS! Ultimately the solution is solved by technobabble, a lazy hackneyed plot device, the new Deus Ex Machina for a terrible set of writers.",1
7,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" The Void (TV Episode 2001)",Does a great job of really showing why Star Fleet's philosophy works,"I've always found this episode to be one of the best to use as an example of what makes Starfleet's philosophy work, as opposed to the behavior of the Klingons, Romulans, and other more aggressive races.Voyager is trapped in a dimensional void, where there are no resources of any kind, other than from other star ships who are trapped. Previous to Voyager's appearance, the law of the land was raid any new ship that appears, and fight it out yourself.Janeway, using Starfleet principles, instead decides to create a mini star fleet, by convincing other ships to band together, share resources, in order to escape their situation.It shows how the more aggressive species hurt this concept with their behavior, and why the joining of forces works well.On top of that, it is a pretty exciting episode, with many good scenes, and satisfying from start to finish. One of the very best ST Voyager episodes.",10

Well, Janeway being a galactic goody-goody, she decides the best tactic is to make friends with everyone and she proposes making an alliance so that everyone can help each other. However, this isn't embraced by everyone. Some species are just jerks! And some of the jerks either want to betray their new 'friends', hold back on supplies they are about to share or take pleasure in killing off some native humanoids (frankly, I could understand as these dirty looking musical creatures did seem pretty annoying).Aside from the Doctor continually mispronouncing 'Fantome' (it was supposed to be French but his pronunciation was WAY off) and the annoying native creatures, this was a decent episode.

Of course, the ship was part of the commandeering plan and the attackers attempted to salvage it. The Doctor saved the ship by hiding in the nebula.Chakotay, Kim and Neelix, out on a mission, return and embarked on a rescue mission after locating their people. Tuvok started to remember and managed to communicate this to Seven before breaking completely down and was hauled away for engramatic resequencing. Seven investigates further with the help of a law official.Meanwhile, Janeway develops a romance with Jaffen (James Read) a nice fatherly type from a race that don't have fathers. This came out as a joke and story he told about a hostile encounter with a man who tried to insult his father. It was interesting to note a character that evidently breeds asexually, that is male and very sexually interested in Janeway. This would not be a usual combination. However, the plot and acting are up to the usual good standard of the Star Trek legacy.",8

No, she and most other crew members had been captured by aliens and had their memories altered to believe that was where they belonged. The only members of the crew not taken were Chakotay, Harry and Neelix who were on an away mission at the time and The Doctor who is now the ""Emergency Command Hologram"". While most of the crew get on with their new lives Tuvok starts to realise something is wrong even though he can't fully recall his past life. When Chakotay and the others find the planet the crew are on he and Neelix go down to the surface to recover the crew but that isn't as easy as it should be as they have no idea who he is. They manage to beam B'Elanna back to the ship but as the episode ends Chacotay finds himself cornered by local security while Voyager must move away as it comes under attack.This opening episode of a two part story was pretty good, establishing the characters in their new lives and setting up potential villains or allies. It was nice to see the Doctor get a chance to use his ECH subroutines and his bickering with Harry about who was in command while Chakotay was on the surface was amusing. Another thing I liked was how the crew retained many of their characteristics; Seven was still obsessed with efficiency and Tom was still rather laid back.",8

Then, ships came to scavenge Voyager but the Doctor (acting as Captain) was able to evade them until the three crewmen returned. Here's the weird part.

I liked the idea of a race who will go to ANY length to get workers for its industries.

In order to figure out what is going on and escape the planet the crew must both trust each other and local personnel.This episode provided a good conclusion to the story. I liked how the crew on the surface only gradually came to accept that they had been kidnapped, even then many other them were relying on the circumstantial evidence that they had all been employed on the same day and had had medical treatment. It was also nice that not all of the people on the planet were villains or victims. Indeed most people are just ordinary people getting on with their lives.",8

Then, the crew have forgotten most of their past and are now happy workers at some giant industrial complex. In the meantime, Chakotay, Kim and Neelix were in the shuttle and missed all this. Now upon returning to Voyager, they learn what's occurred and are determined to get the crew back and de-program them. When the episode ends, an away mission to rescue B'Elanna ends with all sorts of crap going wrong.This episode has more of the same--more attempts by the crew to contact ex-crew members and bring them back to the ship. Additionally, I really liked that so many on the planet did NOT know that their new workers had been brainwashed and others did. This conspiracy aspect was pretty cool.

One thing that we can bank on (and sometimes it detracts) is that the Doc can solve almost any medical situation. The race that erased the memories and built new ones never had a chance against him.

The Doc sees exactly what she is up to, and not one word of this leaks out of his Program.It seems that The Borg have built in a self destruct for any Drone that becomes too much of an Individual, it's part of her main Cortical Node.So we have to have a tacit Pause at the Coda, to be continued at some time before the Series ends. Her Holo-Chakotay was simply an experimental choice, but we see that Chakotay might really have a true interest and attraction to her. I've always agreed with this, even more than Tom and B'Elanna.

Unfortunately she is spending so much time there that it is impacting on her work. This is rather serious when Voyager finds itself in an alien weapon testing area with its warp drive off line. Seven is meant to be working on finding a way to locate incoming weapons before they can do further damage but instead she is spending more time having a relationship with a holographic version of Commander Chakotay. Ultimately her holodeck activities are stopped, not by the Captain but by her own Borg implants which unbeknownst to her were programmed to shut her down if she got emotionally stimulated.I think Seven of Nine is a great character but this was not her best episode, her Borg obsession with efficiency is one of the things that make her an interesting character so seeing her act like everybody else wasn't all that exciting...

Keegan de Lancie did a reasonable job as Q Jnr, and John de Lancie, his real life father, was fine as Q Snr.

He agrees to rewrite his work but his publisher releases the work anyway claiming that as a Hologram the Doctor has no rights so can't protect his work. This leads to a tribunal to determine just what his status is.I rather enjoyed this episode, finding USS Vortex to be an amusing parody of life on Voyager and I loved Tom's revenge with USS Voyeur. While a similar episode had appeared in ""The Next Generation"" that had less comic elements and was made many years earlier so I think it was okay to reuse the idea of exploring the idea of rights for artificial life forms.",8
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Author, Author (TV Episode 2001)",Super Episode! Open Your Mind. Empathize With What Other People Are/Might Be Living With...,"I won't give much away (I usually strive not to with my IMDb reviews, as I prefer to speak in terms of how media makes me feel, while also discussing matters of logic/good writing). But I have to agree with the two positive reviewers of this episode. I find it kind of strange that two people reviewed it so positively, and that two reviewed it soooo negatively! ""Author, Author"" is a great episode! What needs to be said, is said. And the resultant decision and consequences at the end of the episode are believable and well written. Just so you know, this is a funny and very touching episode, in equal measure. Seven gets to make more of a connection to reclaiming her humanity, too. So, it's not all about the Doctor.There are certain parallels occurring even now, in 2016, with regard to acceptance of certain sexual and gender orientations - which this episode strikes a chord with, if you ask me. Not that it covers these topics, per say, but its points can easily be carried through and onto such subjects, and highlight them (for anybody with an empathic enough, and wise enough heart/mind).When I saw this episode, it again served as a reminder and question of ""Just how many times does the Human Race need to make the EXACT SAME MISTAKES over something/somebody which/who is ""different"" or against ""the norm"" - how many times does it need to go on the ""Witch Hunt"" - before it finally grows a gosh darn BRAIN, and learns its lesson!?"". I highly recommend that you watch and enjoy this episode of Voyager (I am sure the latter is an inevitability). And hope that you give that question above some major thought. Because, what are we, if we can't empathize, and put ourselves in the shoes of another? The answer, is NOTHING. Live Long, And Prosper...",9
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Author, Author (TV Episode 2001)",One of the best!,"I noticed one reviewer referred to this episode as 'the worst of the worst'. Oddly, to me it's one of the better episodes and it's obvious that there are lots of difference tastes out there. For me, the funny episodes they periodically tossed in were among some of the very best--they provided some welcome relief from the otherwise VERY serious nature of the show.When the show begins, they've established a Skype-like system where crew members can make live calls to the Alpha Quadrant. Surprisingly, one of the most excited about this is the Doctor! Despite being a hologram, he has ideas about becoming a great author and his ego is stroked when a big publishing house wants his novel. Folks are shocked, however, when they see that this novel sure makes it look as if the Doctor is a great, great man and the crew, which is WAY too much like Voyager's, is full of evil jerks who couldn't get along without the Doc. It's VERY funny to say the least. But what is funnier is Tom Paris' re-write. In it, the Doctor is a jerk AND he sports a ridiculous comb-over! Overall, this episode is very slight but it's also very funny. If you don't mind a tongue-in-cheek episode, it's one of the better episodes of the final season. Well worth seeing--and it's a great chance to see just how far the Doctor's ego has gone!By the way, two of the guest stars in this ones are Barry Gordon (the blue publisher) and the arbitrator (Joseph Campanella). It's nice to see these familiar faces on the show.",9
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Author, Author (TV Episode 2001)",I Enjoyed the Novel,"I know! Will they ever get home? There is something sort of disappointing in the fact that the crew is able to get routine messages home. Some are silly. Some are touching. But that fact of being stranded and making their way is sort of lost. Some real edge has been removed. That aside, the Doctor does a hilarious job of making a total farce of Voyager and the crew. When the captain shoots a guy in sickbay so the doctor can work on Marseilles (Paris) and get him to the bridge, it is hilarious. I do admit that the trial at the end is a tired motif, done many times in a variety of venues. Still, it works well.",7

And if anyone here has seen TNG's ""measure of a man"", where Picard defends Data's status/rights as a sentient being, they will recognize the court scenes as a direct rip-off; one that in my opinion was very poorly done.I like seeing the fate of the other EMH doctors brought up again. I had actually been hoping for it to happen, but not like this. I could not believe that the doctor had chosen this method for getting that point across. Living witness showed an evil version of the crew and I love that episode. But that was the history that Quarren had been taught. But I don't think that display was this despicable and it is despicable to have a crew member write it. The court scenes I mentioned are something you will have to form your own opinion on.

And the last half of the ep was, to me, an insult to the greatness of TNG's ""The Measure of a Man"". I won't go into that for fear of spoiling. You'll just have to see for yourself. (shudder).The problem in the ep, from the characters Point of view is ""how could the doctor write anything so demeaning to us?"". MY question is how could the actors agree to anything this demeaning to them! Adding this to the other eps around it gives us only one more question.

0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Friendship One (TV Episode 2001)",Give that man a red shirt!,"Shortly after Earth developed warp technology a probe was launched in to space which in a spirit of friendship contained details of various useful technology as well as cultural details about Earth, this probe was last heard from as it headed into the Delta Quadrant. In their first official mission for almost seven years Voyager is asked to retrieve the probe as it is believed to be near them. When they locate it on an apparently uninhabited planet an away team is dispatched to retrieve it. They find the planet is a radioactive wasteland but isn't as uninhabited as they thought; taken prisoner they are told that Earth is to blame for the suffering as the conditions result from the locals' attempts to use the technology used in the probe. The leader of the local populations tells Janeway that if she wants to get her people back she must find a new planet for them all to live on and transport them there. When asked to give a crew member back as a sign of good faith one is returned... dead having been executed just before transporting. While three of the away team are captured Chakotay and Harry capture a prisoner of their own and one Voyager he is treated for his radiation sickness and discusses an alternate solution to the problem.This was a good episode which showed how something done with the best of motives can have terrible unforeseen consequences. It also mirrored classic episodes from the original series where a group of regular characters would be joined on an away mission my a character we'd never seen before who's job was to die to show just what sort of danger they were up against, it is just a shame he wasn't wearing a red shirt!",8

The probe made it to the Delta quadrant and was received/captured by a people who then proceeded to misuse the technology, ending up with the equivalent of a nuclear wasteland.Voyager, having established a real-time comm link with Star Fleet, is assigned to go looking for the probe, and they find the planet. The survivors are led by a bitter coot who blames humans for intentionally sending a device designed to destroy their civilization. Right, my blame man. The leader arbitrarily rejects attempts by the away team to help them and further they murder one of the unarmed crewmen right before sending him back to Voyager. And the ""big-hearted' Voyager crew convinces Captain Janeway that they are responsible for the problems these virtue-less but self-righteous dummies on the planet are facing.The creators of this episode were so busy preaching they sank into moronic myopia. One group of people can be recklessly irresponsible but they are totally innocent and another group of people must be responsible for themselves AND the first group? This is how we know that actors and the people that surround them must generally be drop-outs -- they have no capacity for critical thinking. This acidic tone of judgment against decency makes it impossible to just enjoy the story.Suppose I spend all my time watching these stupid episodes and lose my job? Are the show's writers then bad people responsible for my loss?Really, Voyager-Land, some amount of kookiness I can deal with but this is way over the top.

However, when the shuttle team land, they find that the place IS inhabited (despite the sensors) and these people are really angry. They blame the Earth for their plight, as they used the technology that powered Friendship 1 (antimatter) and destroyed themselves. Sure, a few folks remain, but they look nasty and are suffering from the aftereffects of the antimatter explosion. Not surprisingly, these folks are very hostile and soon take some of the away team prisoner. Now they try to use the team as a bartering tool and things get even nastier very quickly.This episode features some very nice make-up effects. The sore- covered aliens look really realistic and nasty. While the baby didn't look great--the rest of them sure did. In addition, the story is pretty exciting and worth seeing.By the way, this story seems a lot like an episode from ""Space: 1999"" concerning a probe powered by a 'Queller Drive'. This system ended up killing things because of its toxic emissions--and soon folks effected by it come looking for retribution!",8

The probe could just as easily have brought prosperity these people. They made their own beds. And to make matter worse, this megalomaniac decides it's his right to deprive everyone else based on his own hatred. He talks about how nothing they do will bring back all the dead.

While they attempt to avoid breaking the prime directive they find the Ventu are more helpful than they expected; helping them find the remains of the shuttle so they can lower the energy shield to beam out. In orbit Voyager also tries to find away through the barrier which they have been told was erected by aliens to protect the primitives from more advanced people, the Ledos, elsewhere on the planet who wanted to exploit the them. When Seven finally gets the shield down it is clear that the Ledos haven't given up their hopes of exploiting the Ventu and are willing to use force to prevent Voyager re-establishing the shield. In a light-hearted sub-plot Tom breaks local piloting regulations and is forced to take a pilot training course with an officious local.The main story was pretty good, I liked the Ventu who communicated through a sign language which Chakotay tried to learn the basics of. The idea of having an advanced civilisation exploiting a primitive one was admittedly rather cliché but worked well enough. The secondary plot provided a few laughs especially when he abandons his class to remove the Ledos from Ventu territory while under fire.",7
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Natural Law (TV Episode 2001)",Chakotay and Seven really do great justice to the Prime Directive.,"The Prime Directive is often mentioned on the Trek shows. Its concept is that the Federation should NOT interfere with native species and allow them to grow naturally. Here they play lipservice to it at times.Chakotay does some lousy piloting of the shuttle and gets way too close to an area they were told not to approach! The invisible shield above smashes their craft and he and Seven crash through the barrier and land below. There they encounter a very primitive tribe of nice tribal folks and almost immediately Chakotay starts interacting with them. I guess that the Prime Directive was recently repealed. Seven, however, thinks that the Prime Directive DOES still apply and disagrees with Chakotay. She then shows her devotion to the Prime Directive by losing her tricorder--something which she never recovers and they eventually leave behind. Later, with the help of the natives, they find a way to contact Voyager. Unfortunately, now the Ledosians plan to improve the lives of these tribesmen---and it's all made possible by the break in the invisible dome caused by the shuttle.There's another minor plot in which the always impulsive and child- like Paris gets in trouble with some locals due to his hotdogging while piloting his shuttle. They insist that he take a class on how to fly! The Captain agrees and even though he thinks it's beneath him, he takes the class--always looking for a way to skip out this. After all, he IS a man-child and being responsible just ain't how he rolls. Fortunately, his instructor is NOT wowed by Paris' lies and attempts to get out of the class or end it prematurely. In the end, after massive exposure of the Federation to the tribespeople, the Captain then decides to close this dome forever. This is sort of like deciding your daughter will remain a virgin after she's already had her baby! All in all, a confusing and morally ambiguous episode that just seemed inconsistent and odd to say the least.",5
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Natural Law (TV Episode 2001)",Missed an opportunity,"I loved Voyager, but some of the episodes were hit or miss.

Rather than allowing a relationship to build naturally over several episodes, it's sprung on us as an afterthought.The episode itself was kind of meh, although I did enjoy the performance of a young Autumn Reeser as one of the natives.I'll skip all the Prime Directive dialogue that's been discussed in other reviews, but yeah- there's that too.",6

For starters, the A plot takes a coma-inducing twenty-five minutes to start moving and in the end, the final five minutes (before the epilogue featuring Seven of Nine and Chakotay) have been stuffed so full that the flash by in such a hurry that it's not worth the long set-up. And, of course, this is yet one boring Prime Directive episode. Then there's the B plot, a ""comedic"" story of Tom Paris having to attend flight school. It's so not funny that it makes me want to cry. Of course, it *conveniently* merges with the A plot in the end. So conveniently that it constitutes as lazy writing. The only saving grace of this episode is, of course, Jeri Ryan as Seven and an all too brief appearance of semi-legendary rent-a-dislike-able-elder-guy Ivar Brogger who's been in pretty much every TV show that amounts to something. Some interest may be also found in the fact that this is credited as Autumn Reeser's (the lovely Taylor in The O.C.) first acting work, but she's practically unrecognizable, a ten-year-old in alien make-up. So, in the end, a boring episode with only curiosity value.",4
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Natural Law (TV Episode 2001)","Janeway the Anti-Scientist, Liar, Cheater","Leaving aside the stale mediocrity of the episode, I'll get right to the stupid.The episode involves a planet in which there is a primitive tribal culture literally locked under a forcefield shield that was established by another alien species hundreds of years ago that has disappeared. These people are directly related to the highly advanced species that is currently interacting with Voyager.Naturally, Tattoo-boy and Seven of Nine get stuck in this when their shuttle crashes into it, all because Idiot-face wanted to look at the planet from the shuttle. They accidentally get involved with these tribal people, which Chakotay at first tried to avoid, due to the Prime Directives.However, his Prime Directive dribble goes right the hell out the door once they do find him, and he has the GALL to chastise Seven of Nine for NOT attempting to connect and communicate with the people, and FURTHER interfere with their lives.So towards the end, they manage to break open the forcefield using technobabble, and the civilization immediately comes down to explore and research the tribal peoples, a unique opportunity comparable to modern-day people not just of our own technology, but our ideals and policies of non-interference with a tribal culture.BUT JAAAAAANEWAAAAAAAAY HAS TO GET HER TYRANNIC SELF INVOLVED!!!~! Because this is the show that brought you ""Tattoo"", an episode so filled with spiritual love and respect for Native Americans, they established in canon-Trek that they were primitive, culture-less savages until they were touched by White Men from space, and who brought you Chakotay, a walking stereotype of Native American cliché's that often interfere with its own continuity (A man who fights the Cardassians in defense of his home also espouts that ""home is wherever you happen to be""), NATURALLY THIS IS A BAD AND TERRIBLE THING! Let's get this clear; these civilized people are not the ""Manifest Destiny""-era Americans, or Colonial Europeans. They do not plan to subjugate or exterminate these people, or study them while moving them to controlled environments and uprooting their culture. These are people who have been given a unique opportunity to witness FIRST-HAND the genesis of their own civilization, LITERALLY untouched by anyone.BUT JAAAAAAAAAAAANEWAAAAAAAY SAYS NNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! Because this goes against the New Age pseudo-hippie spiritualism, Janeway absolutely REFUSES this scientific opportunity, DESPITE BEING A FORMER SCIENCE OFFICER HERSELF, and decides to MANIPULATE THE PRIME DIRECTIVES TO SERVE HER OWN PURPOSES, by claiming that the technology used to open the forcefield is HERS, so she's gonna take it back because of Starfleet policy of non-interference with their planet...DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY ALREADY INTERFERED BY OPENING IT IN THE FIRST PLACE, MUCH LESS CHAKOTAY AND SEVEN OF NINE MAKING CONTACT AND COMMUNICATING.So what she allows by an accident born of pure stupidity in order to save the lives of one dimwit and one former Borg, she disallows in the name of cultural and scientific enlightenment of an ENTIRE CIVILIZATION! Naturally, since they go against JANEWAY'S point of view, these civilized people take all of 2.2 minutes to START FIRING ON VOYAGER! So Janeway escapes, denying an entire civilization the chance to study and better understand and appreciate their own past, for pretty much no coherent or logical reason other than fear.Yes, fear. Fear that these civilized people might destroy the culture of these tribal peoples. This fear would be well-founded if these civilized people showed anything BUT reverence, awe, and respect for these people already. Even then, it doesn't say much about the benevolence of Earth that they utterly shut down a huge opportunity for learning out of fear.",1

When the Delta Flyer enters the field it is damaged my mining charges and makes a forced landing on the Telaxian's asteroid. After the landing Neelix is disappointed to find that the people there are suspicious of any non-Telaxians. As he gets to know them he grows to understand their suspicions as a group of alien miners are demanding they leave the asteroid so they can mine the minerals there. Voyager tries to help negotiations between the Telaxians and the miners but the latter are determined to mine the asteroid. It looks as if all is lost but Tuvok points out to Neelix that what the Telaxians need is a leader who can help them defend their home. Neelix then departs in his shuttle and helps them set up a shield around the asteroid. Having grown close to one of the women there he decides to stay with them and be the Federation's ambassador in the Delta Quadrant.This was a good episode which saw the first departure of a major character since Kes left at the start of season four. Over the years Ethan Phillips did a fine job as Neelix, a character who could be a little annoying at times but overall was a fun character. This episode is also the last to feature young Naomi Wildman, to my mind the best Star Trek child as Scarlett Pomers played her as a normal child. The final scene between them was quite touching.",9

The whole point of the series is that Voyager's crew is trying to get home to their own people.

This was a chance for the crew and for the audience to say good-bye to Neelix within the plot of an episode that would leave him with his people, yet still accessible to Voyager (as a permanent ambassador to the D quad). The final goodbye scene where Neelix leaves the turbolift and walks through the corridors lined with the Voyager crew is one of the most poignant in the series.",10

He is sincere but can be so annoying and, at times, clueless when it comes to social interactions (he can't take a hint). Still, he provided color and flair to the show. I always had trouble because I thought his head looked like a slow-pitch softball, but that's another issue. I forgot that his ship was still in dry dock and available to him. He obviously had technical skills and expertise in the ways of he galaxy. When he is given responsibilities, he is able to adapt to situations, even dire ones. Here we have him reconnecting with his species. Remember that his family and a huge number of Talaxians were the victims of genocide. He has been willing to combat his loneliness out of gratitude for his situation. Remember, at one point he nearly committed suicide. Anyway, I found this an extremely poignant farewell to an interesting character.",9
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Homestead (TV Episode 2001)",Touching Farewell with missed opportunities,"NOTE: This is more of a criticism than a review, but I hope you find it useful!!I was pleased to see during the opening credits that this episode was directed by the famous ""Geordi La Forge"" from The Next Generation (real life = LeVar Burton).The Good: Neelix encounters his own kind, bonds with them, and ultimately leads them to stand against a greedy mining cartel. Overall a good episode, but there are 3 things which made it ""not great""...1. I always thought shuttle crafts were used too infrequently in the Star Trek series, and when they would appear, they would almost always be casually traveling through space (or rarely, an atmosphere). So I was pleased to see this episode using a shuttle for a good purpose (to investigate an asteroid field too dangerous for the ""large"" Voyager spaceship).I mostly liked the scene where the shuttle crash-lands on the asteroid. This seems very believable, and the FX are very good for the time, but somehow it still looked a bit fake. I am not sure if this a poor ""model"" shot, or ""sub-par"" CGI, but either way the shuttle crash scene ended with non-convincing visuals. On the other hand, I must say that except for the final seconds of the crash scene, the shuttle appeared very believable!2. Near the end of the episode, Neelix (who lost weapons on his ship) decides to heroically defend the asteroid colony by putting his ship in the path of an enemy torpedo. Sadly (my opinion), his heroism is nullified by a surprise appearance of the Delta Flyer which destroys the enemy's projectile. Sad because there was *no* need for Cpt.Janeway to magically come to the rescue... I believe Neelix's ship, which had undamaged shields (according to the story we see) could have survived the impact of the enemy (without outside help). Can you say anti-climatic? Or perhaps counter-climatic? Either way, Neelix was robbed of his heroic moment... FOR SHAME!!!3. The final scene shows Neelix walking through Voyager's corridors lined with Voyager crew members. At first (and overall), I found this scene very touching. The crew decided to give a standing ovation to a person who will be missed... my eyes got very teary in this scene! However, at the end of the corridors, he sees the senior staff and friends... Now I think this is typical for a dramatic TV show, but what amazed me (in a negative way) is that he didn't hug or kiss anybody goodbye! Well maybe Telaxians aren't like humans, but really, how could he leave without giving a heartfelt speech to young Naomi? Even a small hug or kiss on the cheek with a simple line like ""I will always remember you"" would suffice... but he just walks past her without a word. Cold...So the above are my 3 ""note-worthy"" criticisms. Now that I think about it, it was annoying that Neelix and his female Telaxian (Dexa?) often wanted (or so it appeared) to be intimate, but nothing happened until the very final seconds of the episode... where we get to see a hug. Hmmm....ANYWAY, I really enjoyed this episode for the most part, but those 3 issues mentioned above broke my sense of disbelief... the episode wasn't totally ruined because of those issues, but it could have been much better......so 8 of 10.",8
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Homestead (TV Episode 2001)",Neelix leaves and Tuvok is going to be crying his eyes out....inside.,"This is the final episode for Neelix. As the series was winding down, the decision was made by some writers to ditch this guy in the Delta Quadrant. My wife cried. I was a bit less overwhelmed by his loss.When the show begins, Voyager encounters a hidden group of 500 Talaxian refugees hiding out under the surface of some planet. Considering how few of them are left, it's perhaps the last chance for these people to avoid extinction. However, some race of bullies wants the planet and considering how weak and few the Talaxians are, things look really bad. That is, until Neelix comes to the rescue. Their plight is now his plight and he's not about to knuckle under to these jerk-faces. So he decides to help them and eventually stays with them and Voyager continues on to the Alpha Quadrant.This is a pretty good show--full of heart and one that fans of the series probably will find a tad upsetting.",8
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Renaissance Man (TV Episode 2001)",Too over the top,"The premise of this episode really does not quite make sense. The Doctor has now matured for seven years. He would not freeze away crew members and impersonate them to save the Captain from some alien traders holding her hostage to obtain a warp drive - and only the Doctor knows about it!The episode would not have fitted earlier in the series because the Doctor would not have had the attachment to do what he does here. It does not fit later in the series because the Doctor has a lot of experience and understands that such a situation is best resolved working with the crew. And no, the feeble excuse that the aliens can see what he sees and hear what he hears is not enough to explain it: he communicates with the crew in subtle ways at the end, so why not right away? He's not stupid, you know.The episode is still sort of silly fun as the Doctor tries to imitate B'Elana, Chakotay and other assorted characters he's stowing away in the ship's morgue as they catch on to his scheme to save the captain alone while sacrificing the warp drive. And it features those bumbling aliens from The Hive, who have decided to become highway robbers. So if you take it in the vein of a comedic escapade at the penultimate tick of the clock of Voyager's final season, it's OK. Hence still a 5.If you like The Hive and the Doctor, watch the ""Tinker, Tenor, Soldier, Spy"" episode again and see how it's done right.",5

He suggests making a run for it but she insists they must obey as the alien species has cloaked ships and superior weapons. Reluctantly he follows her orders but when she starts to act strangely he goes to see the Doctor so he can give her a check up. Later he claims to have seen her and determined that there is nothing wrong with her health. Chakotay goes to see the captain and realises that the person in front of him isn't Captain Janeway. Before he can do anything though he is drugged and hidden in the ship's morgue. At this point we learn that the captain was in fact the Doctor who has been working with two aliens to steal Voyager's warp core in exchange for the captain who they are holding captive. As he proceeds he impersonates further crew members until he finally gets his hand on the core. Once he hands it over he finds that the aliens have no intention of honouring their side of the bargain and ends up a captive alongside the captain.This was a fun Doctor led episode... although for the first quarter that wasn't obvious as he was impersonating the captain. Once we realised he was impersonating various crew members it was fun to see the hints he gave to who he really was; such as when he is pretending to be B'Elanna and tells Tom the food he is giving her is unhealthy. It was also fun to see him confessing his various misdemeanours when he thinks his program is about to decompile.,8
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Renaissance Man (TV Episode 2001)",A Bump in the Road,"Going into the final episode, this episode does nothing to segue into that major event. This starts with a sort-end-of the-road event, reporting the potential destruction of Voyager and the resettlement of its crew. A formidable adversary proves, however, to be anything but. Instead, we are reintroduced to those two fat guys from a previous episode. They are scroungers and have come up with a plan to get the warp core from our favorite starship. They have kidnapped the Captain and the Doc and are using the holographic talents of the transparent physician to manipulate the crew. Soon he is impersonating just about the entire main staff. This has some fun stuff in it, and the Doctor's confessions at the conclusion are quite hilarious. But the episode seems so out of place and so far fetched, even in the Voyager world, that it hardly seems possible. I look forward to the conclusion. It certainly has been a circumlocative path to this point.",7
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Renaissance Man (TV Episode 2001)",I think the Doctor was very poorly written in this episode....very poorly.,"I really did NOT like this episode as the Doctor's character really behaved irrationally. So much of what he did simply made very little sense. When the show begins, the Captain mentions that they'll be jettisoning the warp core and moving to a planet nearby! Her reason for this seems silly and through the course of the show, she acts batty. It's because down deep it ISN'T her but the Doctor posing as her! In fact, he then poses as several other crew members--all in order to steal the ship's warp core. Why he's done all this is explained but his logic sure seems faulty and stupid. Overall, this is a very weak episode--the sort that make you feel that it was about time to end the series--which occurs in the following episode. The only real positive part of the show is when the Doctor thinks he's dying and he makes some funny confessions.",4
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Renaissance Man (TV Episode 2001)",A clear example of how stupid decisions and insubordination are encouraged in voyager,"So, you're the doctor, an hologram.
You're with the captain in a shuttle, and it's attacked.
The captain is held hostage, and they're going to kill her if you don't do what the attackers want (two pathetic aliens). She orders you to not comply, and to inform the crew of their plans.
So, what do you do? Exactly the opposite of what your captain ordered you.
You attack several of your comrades, eject the core, rendering Voyager defenseless, and then you go to exchange the core for your captain's life, but instead of that, you're taken prisioner also.
The only thing that made sense, is that the doctor leaved a secret message with a way to find them, so they manage to rescue them with a shuttle (because Voyager is disabled) and a lot of luck.All of this could be avoided by simply telling the crew what was happening. They can kill the captain, but then nothing stops the Voyager from turning them into sub-atomical particles, so that would be a really stupid decision to be made by the aliens.So, what happens after everyone returns to the ship? No effective penalty for the doctor, that's for sure! Even if that's kind of a cout martial kind of behaviour, which endangered the ship and the lives of everyone, but hey! it's Voyager, what did you expected!? Not even restraining of the doc's program, nor disabling the ""command mode"" which gave him enough security autorization to eject the core!!So, this episode tells us that the doctor is just another time bomb inside Voyager, waiting to explode at any time. As if the incredibly violent delta quadrant wasn't enough!!",3
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Renaissance Man (TV Episode 2001)",Dreadful episode,"While I'm a fan of Voyager there are times when Star Trek really does make laughable story choices. This is absolutely one of those times. The poor writing and total lack of continuity in character development is a classic example of just how bad writing can get. The total nonsense of the storyline, that doesn't have a complete conclusion with there being no repercussions for the Doctor, makes for very painful, watching. As almost the last episode it's astounding that they thought this was worthy of the end of a run. In a word: dire.",1
0,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)","I was satisfied, I want more though!","The past few months I have collected Voyager seasons 4 to 7 on DVD (I only had 1 to 3 on video before that, because Kes is my favourite character) and have just reached the end. I saw them when they were originally shown on TV here in the UK but had forgotten most of it. Am I satisfied with the ending? I think I am. Naturally as I fan I would have liked to have seen more about what happened to the characters when they got home but that's left to our imagination. In many ways ""Endgame"" is similar to Next Gen's ""All Good Things"" The involvement of the crew in the future, but mainly the captain. A new romance starting in the finale (Troi and Worf in Next Gen and Seven of Nine and Chakotay here), which results in death in the future. I truly loved ""Endgame,"" fair to all characters, Neelix appears although he left the ship two episodes earlier. B'elanna gives birth to her daughter with loving husband Tom. Tuvok is ill but returning home means he can be cured. Harry has always been the most anxious and determined but admits the journey is important. The Doctor, in the future, is well respected by all and finally chooses the name Joe! But of course the Captain has the largest role, meeting her future self who wants to get the crew home earlier to prevent casualties. The Borg are involved, as they have played a massive part in this period of Voyager. Alice Krige plays the Borg Queen again fantastically, just her voice and acting method are magnificent. I feel sorry for Susanna Thompson though, the TV Borg queen replaced by the movie Borg queen. Maybe she wasn't available though. The special effects are fantastic, the Borg sub space hub and the Borg queen falling apart! It's very tense. Especially when they come out of the Borg subspace corridor and say their location is right where they thought they'd be after they'd said they'd have to go in a corridor that leads back to the delta quadrant. And what a wonderful idea to get inside a Borg sphere for protection, on the DVD special features they say it was like the Trojan horse. Voyager could have continued. If it was more popular they would have stuck with their original idea of the crew realising the ship is their home, like in Harry's speech and what Tom said because his wife and child are there. And then they could have got home in a film!Overall, Voyager was a bit hit and miss. The sixth season seemed to be one good one followed by one less than good one. The two episodes set in the Holographic Irish village are horrible! My perception of Seven of Nine was that she took over, it all revolved around her, which wasn't true. When she first appeared, season 4 was focused on her for too many of the episodes but it evened out after that. And her character is ingenious at times, 20 years as a Borg drone gradually rediscovering her humanity. I like her, especially in ""Someone to Watch Over Me,"" ""Imperfection,"" and ""Human Error."" When Naomi Wildman was scared of her initially but then became her friend often by her side, that was lovely. Chakotay became my least favourite character. Gone was the chemistry with Janeway (will they/won't they?) and you'd never think he was first officer, he's completely pushed aside most of the time. I loved seeing Tom and B'elanna's relationship blossom against the odds. I always liked Neelix a lot. Tuvok was good at times, especially when he lost his logic, gained emotion and was friends with Neelix. Harry was annoying at times but a okay character at other times. The Doctor is probably my favourite, seeing how far he comes and comedy situations he creates (""Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy"" is fantastic!). Janeway is my favourite Captain of any series and you can tell Kate Mulgrew is really enjoying it. I wish there was more, I love Voyager!",8
1,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",Thank you Star Trek for making Voyager,"I was not really a big fan of Star Trek until past 2-3 years. Thanks to the advent of Netflix and post 2000 video technology distribution, I am able to embark into the past of all the great Star Trek episodes. For those that don't really watch every single episode and know them by heart, through TNG, DS9, Voyager, etc., general popular consensus will say -- ""I like The Next Generation"" the best. That's because Captain Picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of Star Trek starvation. But to be quiet honest, I appreciate the creativity of Voyager's episodes more than TNG. Voyager's episodes also progresses through time unlike TNG. Granted Data from TNG is great but it eventually gets old but Voyager's doctor -- now that's creativity! Instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky, give him the freedom to express beyond anything you imagined. Not only is Picardo such a great actor but the premise setting for his expansive, self growth, as a doctor, self realization now that is science fiction at its best! Endgame portray him as a husband married to an ""organic"", inventing neuro-implant transceiver for human-machine interface, and even -- in the episode before Endgame, to disobey Captain's order and make ""human"" mistakes. Unlike DS9 which are blessed with 2 beautiful women right from 1st episode, Voyager has to survive 3 seasons without Jeri Ryan and I believe it is Picardo that carried them with his personality. Of course the rest of the Voyager's cast chemistry just flows effortless, Harry Kim and Tom Paris -- very natural. I love Tuvoc occasional humor, despite being a Vulcan. Finally, I'm so glad they got rid of that original female captain -- oh, if you get to watch the rare footage -- thank God for Kate! She has developed through the 7 years into an extremely confident, believable, and respectable female captain. What a GREAT job! Thank you Star Trek for making Voyager, I enjoy every episode, the creative exploration of possibilities, of morals, and of our Cosmic expanse.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)","One for the fans, sort of","""Endgame"", like most series finales, is an episode entirely for the fans..and yet in the last few minutes, the writers fail to give the fans a pleasing little coda that would make us all well up with tears. In a way it makes sense: the premise of the series is that the crew wants to get home and so it ends the moment they get home. But it still would have been nice to see Janeway gather everyone together for one rousing little moment.You should watch this episode when you're in a forgiving mood: the Chakotay / Seven of Nine romance comes more or less out of left field. Certainly the writers have hinted at it in two previous episodes (Human Error and Natural Law); now all of the sudden the two are having their ""third"" date. It's a little sloppy, like the rushed ending.The major plot problem, sadly, is pointed out by the Borg Queen in her final moments, which feels like it was the character getting revenge for being killed. She remarks that once her Borg cube has killed Janeway, then the future Janeway will never exist and hence everything she's accomplished will be erased. But the same thing is accomplished if the Borg Queen lets the younger Janeway get home: for of course, this means that she won't have any reason to go back in time to change her past. It's not that I care the writers chose to ignore the paradox of time travel: it's just funny that they would so blatantly call our attention to it.In a way this episode was quintessential Voyager: goofy, slightly illogical, and yet nonetheless engaging and fun. There were good episodes and bad ones, but on average they hit more balls then they missed. They also did much for the advancement of hologram rights: I mean, this episode shows the Doctor has married a human. This in itself boggles the mind and practically begs for a spin off series: I mean just think what you could do with their children.",8
3,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",A great ending to the series,"Some series finales stink, but this one is about as non-stinky as you can get. In fact, this double-length show is among the best in the series--something very rare for any finale.When the show begins, you learn that Voyager was gone a total of 23 years and has now been back on Earth a decade. The Captain is now an admiral and she's quite gray. However, she also has a secret plan-- one that is not acceptable to the powers that be because it's playing fast and loose with the temporal time directive. What her plan is eventually comes to light--she plans to somehow go through time to Voyager in the seventh year of its voyage home. Then, giving them technology from the future, it will allow Voyager both to kick the crap out the Borg AND use their technology to get to Earth 18 years earlier--and, in doing this, save several members of the crew who died during the 23 year trip.This episode has everything going for it. This older Janeway is NOT the touch-feely nice lady she was in the rest of the series--she was VERY willing to play fast and loose with the rules. Plus, she seemed very willing to commit mass genocide against the Borg. This is EXACTLY what most fans of the series probably always wanted and it makes for a very exciting and fun episode that isn't to be missed.",10
4,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",The end of an era,"After seven years Star Trek Voyager comes to an end with this double length episode. The episode opens at a celebration to mark the tenth anniversary of Voyager's return to Earth after a twenty three year long journey back from the Delta Quadrant. There are noticeable absences though and we soon learn that Seven of Nine died in the Delta Quadrant, Chakotay made it back but was never the same after Seven's death and died on Earth and Tuvok has had an emotional breakdown due to an illness which could have been treated in the Alpha Quadrant but not in the Delta Quadrant. Janeway, now an admiral is working on acquiring a device that will enable her to return to the Delta Quadrant at a time when they are close to a Borg transwarp hub which could get them home in minutes. Once back the admiral still has to persuade her younger self that it is possible for them to go up against the Borg and get home, she must also convince herself to use the hub rather than destroying it. Ultimately the two of them come up with an idea which may serve both of these goals although it would call for an act of self sacrifice from the admiral. In a secondary story we B'Elanna gives birth to a daughter who will grew up to help the admiral acquire technology from the Klingons.This episode provided a good if somewhat rushed conclusion to the series, I was pleased that it ended as soon as the were within sight of Earth rather than showing us celebrations and discussions about what they each plan to do now they are back home. Kate Mulgrew did a fine job in the duel roles of Captain and Admiral Janeway, Alice Krige made a welcome return as the Borg Queen, the scenes between her and Janeway were great; I'm pleased that they picked a suitably iconic villain for the final episode... and even more pleased that they didn't mirror the more popular 'Next Generation' by having Q involved. I think that after seven years it was probable the right time to end the series, it left me with fond memories and wanting more not thinking it had dragged on too long.",8
5,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",A Great Ending Not So Great or...,"Well first of all, this comment concerns only the last episode which started great but ends so suddenly, like in 5 minutes, was a little telegraphic like a trailer of a movie or sort... and it left me in air for a while. I had the feeling like wasting time with the series. Probably the director woudn't like to end this nice saga with a cliché like many others with a nice homecoming party or something. But as i said, i shed no tears, i wish i would but i couldn't, like i did after seeing the last episode of TNG, i think it deserved a little fancy speech from the cpt. Janeway or other crewmen. Or in the other way, i wished i could be happy for them, but i couldn't. It was like the borg, no feelings induced.Now, what about the ""no harming other species"" phrase ? Janeway infected the borg with some kinda virus and kills or incapacitates all of them. Or not all of them ? What happens with them? It is somehow contrairing with her previous actions regarding the borg and other species. Or could it be because she is a little older now and she becomes more eager to redeem herself because she didn't want the crew of Voyager to spend another 23 years in the Delta Quadrant bicoz of her fault (or not). Again, this leads to her action against borg. At first she didn't want the caretaker's device to come in other hands and to be used against other species, and now he kills the borg. What about the Federation rules which she respects throughout all these 7 years like a religion ? In my opinion, Voyager series and TNG, i think it deserved a more elaborate ending which should be prepared with an episode or two ahead. I have no experience in making movies :) but after all of these years of hard work from their behalf, i guess it deserved more.",
6,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",So disappointing,"After eagerly waiting to the end, I have to say I wish I wouldn't have joined the whole series at the first place. The final episode was everything against the previous seven years. It has ruined everything. The journey was 23 years, but captain Janeway has the power to reduce it... let say, seven years only. Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? Crewmemebers were dying all along the journey. Why she wants to save Seven of Nine only? The others don't count or what? The most ridiculous part when the crew states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them. As the say, ""journey is more important than the destination"". Unbelievable. And at the finale scene the are surrounded by other Federation ships and the Earth is in sight. Nothing about landing, returning to the normal life.Worst ending ever.",1
7,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",A Great Ending to a Great Family,"This is a great ending to the show. The fact that Adm. Janeway was able to do a double switch on the Borg was great. The fact that she allowed herself to be infected, thus infecting the Queen with a ""poison"" that in, essence, ended the Borg was great. The way they ended it also left some, not a lot, for a reunion movie. However, they did bring them ""home"" and the way they did it was fantastic!! It was sad to say good bye to a part of my family. Ending it with Tom and B'Lanna having their baby just as they enter the Alpha quad. was a great way to show a new beginning. It would be nice to have a reunion movie of some type - just to see where their characters would be today.",10

I would have liked to have seen the crew adjusting to life back on earth after their return. I suppose the writers anticipated this problem by ""front loading"" some Voyager on earth sequences at the beginning of the episode. (Of course, that time line has been eradicated, so it's all moot.) I did like how Admiral Janeway died for the Voyager crew. As fans, we get to have our cake and eat it to, by having Janeway both make the ultimate sacrifice and live on. I admit that the scenes of Janeway and her older self having conversations was bizarre and so easily could have crossed the line into camp. Fortunately, Mulgrew(s) pulled it off.",8
9,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",Future Howlin Mad Broccoli and Janeway ram a show home.,"This show has a multiplex storyline - Janeway in the Future teaches Borg 101 at Starfleet Tech alongside Howlin Mad Broccoli. ""Doctor Joe"" has finally taken a name after 30 years and has gotten Married to a Human, and Tom and B'elanna's daughter is Future Janeway's access to a secret weapon she needs to use to get to where Voyager is in this ep. Janeway has to basically steal this thing from a Klingon named Korath (Vaughn Armstrong's 3rd or 4th Voyager Appearance).In Voyager's current timeline, they have found the treasure of all Borg treasures, and for this and only this episode, the main Borg Queen, Alice Krige, happens to be the Queen in charge.I'm sure Susanna Thompson could have pulled it off, But I've always seen Alice as the Queen of Borg Queens, so it was fitting for her to make this appearance. We know that these Queens can't ever really be killed, they'll just keep being re-grown. And maybe Queen B, Susanna, after fouling up Unimatrix Zero, was demoted for having Janeway kick her arse so much.But the question is, what has Voyager stumbled into? They find a nexus of what seem to be Wormholes inside of a Nebula - A Nebula riddled with Borg Cubes. Alice Queen is very protective of it, and won't let Janeway anywhere near it..Meanwhile, Seven of Sixty-Nine is actually dating Chakotay, despite the danger of her implants overloading due to Human Emotions. and B'elanna is about to drop a progeny, right in the middle of a firefight!This last Voyager episode has everything in it, I was pleased to see it when it was broadcast, I was shocked at the quality, and I still am. This finale is almost as good as Deep Space Nine's as far as wrapping up a bunch of little details, and Dwight Schultz was practically a cast member by this time.But the twist of all twists is the secret of what's really in the Nebula, we've seen it in use in Next Generation and in earlier eps of Voyager. Now we get to actually SEE how Borg can move about the Galaxy so quickly, and it's all based on an idea first referred to in Star Trek III- Something we never really got to see until Next Generation's 6th and 7th seasons.From the first time we see the Borg in Next Generation to this episode, no other Trek show handled the Borg as well as Voyager: They had become more than Mindless Automatons, due to Seven's addition as a crewmember. So I salute this series, as it went out with a much bigger bang than it made when it came on the air with ""Caretaker"" - Even Next Generation and Deep Space Nine end at their beginnings, so to speak. But Voyager never pointed to anywhere else but the Future, which is where Trek should have kept going instead of backtracking it's own past in Enterprise.",10

Because of Admiral Janeway's unhappiness and the loss of Seven in her time, she steals some Klingon technology and goes off to change the past. Once again the Borg are the bad guys, and need to be dealt with. One of the critics says that Janeway commits genocide. I think that is simplistic as the Borg are on a mission of conquest to destroy and assimilate everyone that exists. Although I enjoyed the closure, it would take a book to go through the errors that occurred here, starting with two Janeways being on board the same ship. Just focus on that. I think Einstein would be put to the test. The crew has spent all those years trying to get home and yet they make a pact and ignore the biggest gift horse ever. And are the Borg really gone since they seem to be done in by a futuristic Janeway. Oh well. It was certainly fun anyway.",8

The show deserved a better ending.The overall two part ending had the right pacing, tension and drama, and kept the story exciting. However, I feel for a show that had been running for 7 full seasons the final segment fell pretty flat. I was really expecting some sort of awesome all out battle between the Federation's armada and the Borg sphere; maybe have a happy reunion of families and friends. Instead they popped back into the Alpha Quadrant. And that was it. Roll credits.I could have also absolutely done without the forced romance between Seven and Chakotay; especially since there was a much, much better and more natural chemistry between him and Janeway. I felt it was extremely cringe worthy and read more like a basic 'fan fiction' level of writing. I binge watched this show so the change in romance interests for Chakotay seemed really out of the blue.Overall, the show is amazing and by far one of my forever favorites – but I can't get over how unsatisfying and underwhelming this ending was.""Set a course, for home""",9
12,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",Lackluster hooray........,"I love this show. It is my favourite in the Star Trek world except the original series. Too bad the writers went the ""we don't want to fall into the sappy, captain gives a heroic speech, ticket tape parade trite ending"" that most shows would naturally do. They went the Sopranos ending route and tried to change it up and not form to convention. yes, you can be bold and take that route but you also have to pay the piper if that route fails. I doubt David Chase can go anywhere even years later without a fan coming up and saying, ""WTF guy! I felt stiffed!"" When you have a 2 or 3 hour film you can play that card BUT when you have the finale show after a 7 year run that is ALSO part of a huge fan based universe for the past 40+ years, you have to pay off some debts buddy. Like it or not it is emotionally satisfying having those moments and when you cheat your audience by not showing them at all because you don't as filmmakers want to present the same old same old, then you can't complain when you are dragged out on the carpet for it.

Besides, where are time cops from 29th century to stop her?I enjoyed the series very much but the finale left a sour taste that I still cannot forget; hence my review here to vent.",4

Where were the Time Agents in this episode? How could Janeway have become an Admiral after this? Like much of Voyager this is an ill-considered, inconsistent mess. There was also no real closure for the characters, in ST:DS9 this was somewhat over the top in the final story, but at least it was present.Having the Borg as the villains at the end was a good idea squandered with an awful plot. Good bye Voyager, and good riddance.",2
15,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",Merely Acceptable,"After 7 seasons, I was expecting a fantastic ending, but this two-part finale was merely acceptable. Overall it was a decent story, but the directing and writing was both derivative and lacking...It is derivative because of its extreme similarity to TNG's finale ""All Good Things"": the show opens with a future version of reality (which will never occur) then we (the audience) go back in time with the Captain (now Admiral) and change things ""for the better"" (while ignoring the temporal paradox this creates).So the future (about 25 years after the current time) Admiral Janeway steels federation technology and travels to Voyager's past. She argues with the current Captain Janeway about directives/morals, and gives the old/current Voyager advanced technology. Note I think this is (so far) pretty good story, even if it is derivative.Next the Janeways agree to invade a nebula controlled by the Borg. This would normally be suicide for Voyager, but thanks to future technology, Voyager shakes off all Borg attacks and arrives at a ""trans-warp hub"". Again, this is pretty entertaining...But once Voyager arrives at this important Borg hub, the two Janeways enter a moral/ethical dispute... which is dramatic (and understandable) but also stupid... they spend several minutes near a vital Borg resource without being attacked! Did the Borg suddenly loose interest in Voyager? Does Voyager have some kind of cloaking device that the cast and writers forgot to mention to the audience? Anyway, Admiral Janeway is captured by the Borg Queen, while Voyager and Captain Janeway proceed through the trans-warp hub. The interesting thing (to me) is they are just picking a route at random... any conduit that takes them to the Alpha Quadrant. (I find this entertaining sci-fi...) The Borg Queen assimilates Admiral Janeway, but the future Janeway anticipated this, and is carrying an infection that kills the Borg Queen (and presumably infects all Borg in that sector).Meanwhile, a Borg Sphere chases after Voyager through the trans-warp corridor, and Starfleet amasses an armada of ships to intercept the Borg Sphere. It was kind of cool to see all those federation ships, but it was totally stupid because they had no idea where Voyager would emerge in the Alpha Quadrant (also there was not enough time to amass such a fleet).The series finale ends with Voyager emerging from the conduit in the Alpha Quadrant with debris of the Borg Sphere flying everywhere. That is: Voyager destroyed the sphere, the federation armada never fired a single shot. Kind of lame... Then in the final scene we see Voyager approaching Earth.That's it... there is no final ""welcome home"" or ""congratulations"" speech. This is most disappointing to a fan like me... after 7 years, it would be nice to have a few minutes to ""decompress."" The ending was sorely lacking in an emotional way...In summary, a mostly entertaining (if derivative) story with a lack-luster ending. Many series end without a proper finale, and those with a finale are often poor. So I wish this would have been better, but I still view it as acceptable.My problem is Voyager deserved better than acceptable.",8

Its difficult to pin down exactly what makes this such a great episode. Kate Mulgrew's acting is truly superb as she plays her Admiral self with such confidence and daring, its a treat to watch great acting like that. Its fun to see B'ellana's child as an young (hot) adult. Perhaps its always fun to get a skip ahead or see an alternative version of the people we are used to. The plan is daring and exciting, and its great to see the Borg get kicked around a bit. 'All good things...' (TNG) was a great end episode also, but this one is a little better. I preferred Voyager's more overarching story line to the single episode premise as was TNG. I always wondered why they didn't do more of a continuing story and was very disappointed to find out its the Ass Hats that wanted the single-episode story format for future syndication purposes, so they were more concerned about selling the show as a by-product in the future than actually making the best and most out of the shows potential... ick.",10

The two captains disagree, arguing about the plan. The real-captain visits Tuvok asking him if it's true he has a brain disorder. Tuvok admits it's true, but it can't be cured by the facilities on the ship so he's kept it to himself.The young Captain agrees to the older Captains' plan. To increase their chances of success the older Janeway plans to distract the Borg with her shuttle craft. The Borg actually capture Janeway and her shuttle. The Borg Queen personally assimilates Captain Janeway. But Janeway's expected this! the Borg Queen has assimilated a virus into herself that kills her. With the Borg Queen dead Voyager makes it thru the Warp Conduit back to federation space.",8
18,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",At last!',"At long last this series was coming to an end. I thought this show had far too many low points. It had flashes of brilliance once or twice every season but should have ended at season 5 or earlier. This end episode was a little too similarly themed to Next Gen's colossal 'All Good Things'. In saying that it was an action packed show with a welcome return for Alice Krige as the Borg Queen. The action was first rate and the crew were at their best and ended in the way the viewer would have wanted. In my opinion this show would have gained so much more respect if Seven had, at the last moment turned on the crew and they were all assimilated and the closing scene had Seven and the Borg Queen standing over the crew, in full Borg mode saying 'We are Borg'!!",6
19,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",The ending you would expect for this series... not a good one,"Ok, so the episode goes like this:It starts on the Earth, 10 years after the Voyager arrives, which took 23 years.
They're home, but not everything is ok, Tuvok has lost his mind (neurodegenerative disease), Chakotay is dead, and so is 7 of 9.So, future almirant Janeway has a plan: she gets some time-traveling gear, and goes back in time with her shuttle.Back to the present, Voyager encounters a nebula with a lot of wormholes inside, so they investigate, but there are a lot of Borg nearby, so they go away.Future Janeway makes them a visit (they play safe by checking that this is for real, and not some impostor), and gives them the tech to protect Voyager from the Borg, and just get into the nebula and take the wormhole home. The Borg simply sit there while they upgrade Voyager, instead of taking the tech for themselves and assimilate the heck out of everyone there, for some reason.But when they're inside the nebula, they find that the wormholes are part of the Borg transwarp grid, which is composed of 6 ""wormhole balls"" like this one. So, young Javeway gets indignated with her older self for not telling her, and orders the ship out of the nebula, with the wormhole to get home just in their noses. The crew obeys for some stupid reason. Old Janeway outranks young Janeway after all. I must mention here that Voyager took quite some damage to his new anti-borg shielding, so retreating wasn't the best idea in the world, because there were still a lot of borg cubes in the vecinity, and also because they have anti-borg tech with them and an individual with knowledge from the future which would be a great addition to the Borg.Also, we get to know that Tuvok already has this sickness, and the only ones that could cure them are other Vulcans from his own family, but there's a time frame to do that, that's why he couldn't be saved in the future, because they took a lot of time to get there.So, what's the plan now? Young Janeway has her usual delusions of greatness, and now want to take out the whole Borg transwarp grid!!! WTF?!?!? The crew agrees, by saying that that will save a lot of lives (but won't the Borg just rebuild this and then go to destroy the threat of Earth anyways?) . So after discussing some more with old Janeway, they decide to go with a plan that old Janeway discarded for been too risky, but what the hell, her encounter with her young version has grown on her nostalgia, and now she feels like going with this insane plan.So, Voyager goes for the wormhole at the same time B'Elana is giving birth, because who needs a chief engineer in the middle of a battle with the Borg after all? Had they escaped before, they would be on Earth already, but now she's on labor while all of this transpires. The plan is to take the grid out from the inside by firing their new torpedoes, but for that to work, Old Janeway went to her shuttle before, and uses some deus ex machina chip in her brain to communicate with the Borg queen, offering her to give her the way to resist the new torpedoes, if she promises to get Voyager safe to Earth, and that she don't try to find her, because she's using new tech and she wont be able to do it. The queen finds old Janeway anyways, and begins to assimilate her, but that was the plan all along, as she carries some anti-borg neuro-tech virus that destroys even the queen and everything borg in sight. It's difficult to say for sure, but i think this is supposed to take down the entire borg collective. So they seemed to do what Picard didn't when he refused to commint genocide, even if the Borg are a threat, they're just another species.At the same time, Voyager was inside the wormhole, and was chased by a Borg sphere. As Voyager was damaged before, now it's in danger. The wormhole exit appears on Earth and Starfleet sounds all alarms, and sends some ships there, fearing a Borg invasion.The queen says to old Janeway that the sphere will destroy Voyager, so her young self will die, won't have a future, and so what old Janeway did won't happen anyways (that's probably the only accurate time-paradox sentence in the whole series).Voyager is unsure if it can make to the Earth exit, and considers to take an early exit to the Delta Quadrant (but why? the Borg would pursue them anyways), and to prepare to change course, but the borg sphere opens it's bay, and seems ready to engulf Voyager. Next thing we see, is that the sphere arrives at Earth, and Starfleet shoots the hell out of it.We're with Voyager again, they mention that they're ""where they supposed they would be"", and after some silly seconds, we realize that Voyager changed course to position to the back of the sphere, and is actually in Earth too.THE ENDA far cry from Deep Space's 9 ending when we get to see what happens with every important character.And the worst of it, is that as the Borg Queen said, now there's no need for Janeway to go back in time, so this is a paradox, and will unmade itself. But of course this doesn't happen on the series, either because the writers didn't realized it, or they subestimated their audience.There wasn't any need for all this cheesy ill-executed time travel stuff, not to mention the genocide. Just any difficult to get wormhole with a lot of effort to get access to would do. This series is not quite true to Roddenberry's ideas.",3
20,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",Garbage ending to a great series!,"This just completely spoiled the entire series. If you're looking for a high drama ending, with Voyager triumphantly landing on Earth's surface, the crew been emotionally reunited with their friends and family, and seeing the readjust to Alpha Quadrant then don't look here. Bang they go through a wormhole, there's like 20 starships waiting for them and then thats it.The previous 85 minutes of the show are just some confusing borg time travel drivel with Captain Janeway VS The Borg Queen being the highlight. I really don't know how anyone can say the finale to this series is 'good' when it first came out it broke my heart how awful it was. I thought it had to be a joke, some kind of parody, and the real ending to the series would probably be released at a later date but no such luck.If you look very carefully at the end when Voyager is being chased through a Borg ship, the Borg ship is destroyed for no apparent reason and Voyager makes it through the wormhole. That's just one mistake. The Borg Sphere followed Voyager into the wormhole but yet in the end point in the Alpha Quadrant debris from the Sphere comes out first followed by Voyager.",2
21,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)","Satisfying, and intelligent way end to a good show...","In this day and age where people routinely have 500 cable/satellite channels or more, there is such a glut of content and so much competition for viewers that even great shows never make it past the first season. So, many times I will watch a series and the last show ends up being a cliffhanger with no proper ending. I am left hanging after investing quite a lot of time in a world that is so busy that we have less and less time TO invest. Anyway, I loved how Janeway blasts through Borg cubes like they were made of cardboard with the new Quantum Torpedoes, and the addition of armor was long overdue for the entire series. I liked the going back and forth through time plot, and the aging crew members makeup was believable and the acting competent.The unbelievable portion was the Borg sending only one cube. Bullsnot. They did the same in The Next Gen movie ""First Contact"". Anyway, sorry this review is 13 years overdue, but I just got NETFLIX so....:)",9
22,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" Endgame (TV Episode 2001)",Poor ending to decent st series,"Why would the Borg sphere allow voyager inside?
Never liked Janeway as still cane across so stilted and wooden and wasn't natural at all - total opposite to Picard imo!",3
