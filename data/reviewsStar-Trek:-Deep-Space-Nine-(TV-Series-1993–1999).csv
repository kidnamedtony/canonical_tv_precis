0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Image in the Sand (TV Episode 1998)",Great season opener,"As season seven opens the crew of Deep Space Nine are still trying to come to terms with the death of Jadzia Dax and the closing of the wormhole; hardest hit are her husband Worf who fears that because she didn't die in combat she can't enter the Klingon afterlife and Captain Sisko who has returned home to New Orleans and is wondering what he is meant to be doing now that he is cut off from the prophets.While playing the piano at his father's restaurant Sisko has a vision of desert planet were he digs in the sand and finds a woman, he does not recognise her but after creating a computer image of the face he learns that his father knew the woman. Sure that the vision was a message from the prophets he readies himself to find it, a task which he is aided in by his son, father and an old friend who appears shortly before he is ready to depart.Back on DS9 Bashir, O'Brien and Quark are trying to arrange for Worf to get a position on a Klingon ship so he may go into combat in Jadzia's name and earn her a place in the afterlife. Things seem to be going well for Kira who is now in acting command of the station but things might get awkward when the Romulans ask to use an uninhabited Bajoran moon to build a hospital.This was a good opening episode which mainly sets up the story for the next episode as it leaves each of the three story lines open. As this series has some of the best characters of any Star Trek incarnation it didn't suffer for being more talky than most.",8
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Image in the Sand (TV Episode 1998)",lots of introductions ONLY,"This first episode of the final season of ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"", ""Image in the Sand"" is an important one but not an especially satisfying one. This is because lots of story elements are introduced but there is no resolution of any of them. In other words, you get a taste for what WILL be resolved in the future on the series. When the show begins, Colonel Kira (yes, she's now a colonel) is practically having a love affair with the Romulan leader stationed on DS9. The two ladies seem to be in sync and spend a lot of time congratulating each other...until Kira learns that this 'nice' Romulan is up to something.As for Sisko, he's been off the base for three months and no one has heard from him. Since the release of the Pah-Wraiths, no one has heard from the Prophets and Sisko is out sulking or thinking at his father's restaurant on Earth. Fortunately for his faith, the Prophets deliver him yet another vision...but there is danger just around the corner.Worf is naturally bummed. After all, his wife was just murdered by Dukat and since she didn't die in battle, he cannot hope to meet her in Klingon heaven, Sto-vo-kor. Or, is there some way?And, when the show ends, Dax's new symbiot, Ezri Dax, is introduced. But apart from introducing herself, you know NOTHING about this new series regular.As I said, there are a bunch of plots introduced but no real resolution. The next episode picks up with these but it will take some time for the plots to come into their own. As a result, it's an important episode but one that isn't very satisfying on its own.",7
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Image in the Sand (TV Episode 1998)",Introducing Ezri Dax,"Of all the Season Openers of DS9, this one set up the final story arc so well that our interest was piqued even with the loss of Jadzia Dax.There has been a minor scattering of the main characters of DS9. A new Bajoran Religion of people worshiping the Pah-Wraiths has emerged. The Celestial Temple has been closed and the Bajoran Orbs are all dark and ""The Sisko"", not knowing what he is to do, is on Earth, mainly sitting in front of a piano at his Father's (Played by the great Brock Peters) New Orleans Restaurant. Worf seeks Honour for his deceased wife Jadzia, who was brutally murdered by the Pah-Wraith/Gul Dukat entity.And so while all of these disparate elements converge, The Sisko sees the image of a woman - A woman who plays an important role in this final story arc. And we meet Ezri Dax, who was not a Trill Host Initiate but was compelled to offer herself as Host to Dax due to an emergency.And this is what I mostly want to talk about - Nicole De Boer is Ezri-Dax. And although she is not explored in this episode that much, she does come to be a major plot element of this final season.When I initially watched these episodes that showed how another Host would be after joining with Dax, I hated the Ezri character and I thought she was rather silly. But I have not seen these eps since they were played on TV in the 1998-1999 season, it has been almost 12 years since the final season of DS9, and now I can watch these final eps, and it is as if I am seeing them for the first time- I had seen each of the eps of the previous seasons, more than once, so I was very familiar with the DS9 story: Of Season Seven I had only vague recollections. And so in December of 2011, I am viewing the final season of what I think of now as a great Trek show, one that was basically dismissed by Trek canonisers because of its vast differences from Gene Roddenberry's Future Earth.Well, this series was NOT about Earth, as The Next Generation and TOS was. This series was shown, in the Season 6 Ep ""Far Beyond the Stars"" - as the imaginings of an under-appreciated coloured Sci-Fi writer of the 40's and 50's, about a Coloured man who was a widower with a young son being the commander of a huge Space Station on the edge of Known Space - A Sci Fi story that would NOT have been published back then. And that story of DS9 was never allowed to be published due to that particular racial bias. So, the way I see it, is that ""Benny Russel"" is the actual creator of Deep Space Nine, long before Roddenberry - And since the story was allegedly conceived in the Post War years, the story has WW-II elements in it. Oh yes, we know that the concept was shown to Sisko in a vision of the Prophets, but who is to say, that there never was a Benny Russel who was never allowed to publish a story of a coloured Captain - In charge of a Multi-Racial and Multi-Species ""Space Station""? Part of Quantum Physics states that our imaginings, the books we read, the TV shows we watch, COULD be other Quantum Realities - Or at least could be stories about ""Alternate Time-lines"" - This is why I like Fringe so much, because it explores that even more than it was explored in Next Generation and DS9.Getting back to Ezri-Dax, it is now apparent to me, that Nicole De Boer was carefully cast, and actually uses many of Terry Farrel's mannerisms, eye movements, ways of speaking - This is one of the best continuations of a character I have ever seen, and I BELIEVE it – I really believe now, that Ezri Dax contains the memories of Jadzia Dax, and Curzon, and all of the hosts of the Dax Symbiote. Sometimes, I forget she is not really Nicole De Boer, who is actually an actress of Merit (The Dead Zone series) - She seems at times to be a shorter version of Terry Farrel. And so as Jadzia was the science officer, Ezri is now a ""Ships Counselor"" of sorts - Because that is the Ezri host's special talent- But when required, she can, and does, tap into the previous knowledge of the Jadzia symbiote, and can sometimes perform a task which a science officer would do. This Season, even explores how the one Host who was a murderer could help Ezri solve a Murder Investigation on the Station. And so, I just say it here, this season opener sets up a whole universe of possibilities for ontinuation of the DS9 story arcs.When I watch this DS9 Ep in particular, the Original Trek Story Arc was still strong, but I knew, that this was the end of Trek the way we had known it for the last 15 years of the TNG universe. So: This episode, represents, to me at least, that Trek was turning down the lights, drinking a cup of Tarkalian Tea, and getting ready for Bed - To be Awakened by JJ Abrams in 2009.",10
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Image in the Sand (TV Episode 1998)","Prophets, Pah-wraiths, Romulans, and New Dax","The Pah-wraiths are gaining followers.Sisko is taking time off to wash potatoes, pursue art and music, and treasure hunt for prophets. Finds his mom instead.Worf needs a victory not convoy duty so he goes to Vic's to express his frustrations before getting drunk with Obrien and warming his cockles.Kira doesn't trust the Romulans but she makes friends with one anyway and lets her set up a hospital so they can play poker.Demar and Weyoun have an excellent intelligence network.Other notes:Demar's character is developed nicely here. His exchange with Weyoun early in the episodes says a lot about who he is as a man. He's an underrated and often over looked supporting character but I absolutely love him. New Dax is easy on the eyes and easy to like. Nog is the anti-Scrappy Doo, Jake is the anti-Wesley Crusher.Verdict: Strong start to a new season. The writers take their time to develop individual characters and themes to drive the story. Much of what happens here sets the stage for the final episodes.Fun Facts:Neon signs are still a thing in 24th century New Orleans.

Benjamin has gone back home with Jake and is sitting around wondering what to do. He knows his connection to the prophets is waning. One day he has an image of a desert place where he digs in the sand. He uncovers the face of a woman. This leads to a major piece of information from his father. Meanwhile, Worf is in a rage, destroying things, frustrated that he is helpless to avenge Jadzea. He had hoped she would join him in the Klingon heaven. Other events involve the Romulans who have never been trustworthy forcing themselves into things without consulting the Federation. Sisko now believes that he has what he needs to return as the Emissary but there is one more big surprise for him as he leaves his father's restaurant. This final season looks so great.",9
0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Shadows and Symbols (TV Episode 1998)",Fantastic Episode,"In my country, Guatemala, Star Trek is not a very popular show, in fact, is almost unknown to the vast majority of people, Star Trek DS9 was broadcast intermittently on a schedule that made him inaccessible (12.00 am, 1 am) so because of that and my work, even though I consider myself a true trekkie, it is only now that I could buy it on DVD and see it orderly DS9 series. Far Beyond the Stars, was by far one of my favorite episodes, the story of black writer Benny Russell that at one point could be considered the """" creator ""of the Star Trek universe, it was absolutely fascinating. And it is not until now, October 15, 2012, 14 years after it were originally broadcast, that i finally could watch the episode Shadows and Symbols, and once again the story of Benny Russell, really leaves me speechless, what a brilliant combination of wit, moral lesson, what a brilliant episode. Avery Brooks and the rest of the cast were superb! Guess that's why I love you so much Star Trek, because using my imagination is capable of transporting me to distant worlds and even there, give me a lesson on how to live my life, how to face the challenges of everyday ...it teaches me about being the dream and the dreamer.",9
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Shadows and Symbols (TV Episode 1998)",Vacay on Tyrie,"Sisko and fam go and a vacation to Tyrie and they bring New Dax along. Lets call her Ezri. She's either irritating or endearing I suppose, but I like her and so do you. After wandering around the desert Ezri helps Sisko find his mom with a baseball.Aboard the Rotaran Worf, Martock, Quark, Juliann, and Obrien honor Jadzia's memory by destroying a Dominion shipyard, as is tradition.

Everything I just wrote is true.And finally, on Cardassia, Demar is winning with the ladies while his shipyards are getting blowed up by Worf.Other notes: Far Beyond the Stars is among my favorite episode. Its very satisfying to see more of Benny Russell. Casey Biggs is the perfect choice for Dr. Wycot.Verdict: Satisfying conclusion to the season opener.",8
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Shadows and Symbols (TV Episode 1998)",The Secret Origin and Godhood of Benjamin Sisko,"This 2nd episode of the Season Seven Intro two-parter finalizes the 3 main arcs that all happen simultaneously:The Sisko's discovery of who he really is and the exact nature of his connection to Bajor and The Prophets, Worf's final Homage to Jadzia and Dax's return to the series in a new host, and Kira's confrontation with a Romulan Senator who wants to keep weapons of mass destruction on one of Bajor's Moons.There could have been a 4th arc: The Dax Symbiote's implantation into a new host who was not prepared for the experience of dealing with the 7 lifetime experiences contained in the Symbiote: Instead, the Benny Russells of DS9 chose to write that part of the arc into several carry over episodes, showing Ezri's adjustment to hosting Dax.Oddly enough, they chose to continue the story of Benny Russell as well, in a ""false vision"" from the Pah-Wraiths, who were trying to prevent him from opening the Orb of the Emissary.The Orb is the key to Season 7's opening: And also to the re-opening of the Wormhole and the ejection of the Pah-Wraith entity named Kosst Amojan.This episode refers back to the ""Novelty Episode"" Far Beyond The Stars, assigning more than mere novelty to that part of the story. As The Sisko is intrinsically linked to The Prophets, Benjamin Sisko is intrinsically linked with Benny Russell, whether he was a real historical figure who originally wrote ""Deep Space Nine"" in the 50's or not.The Cyclic Story of DS9 is actually created here, in this 7th season episode: Without the events uncovered here, the entire series never would have happened. Sisko discovers that he actually IS a ""Wormhole Alien,"" at least in part. This foreshadows events in the final episode.But the Pah-Wraiths really don't want The Sisko to open that Orb, first they send an assassin from Bajor, one of the followers of the new Pah-Wraith religion. When that fails, they send the false vision.Ultimately, Sisko had Dax with him, and she helped him get past the false vision. All of these aspects are blended very well in this Episode, which also looks at the natures of both Kira and Worf. And there is also an unlikely connection of Worf to Bashir, Quark, and O'Brien, through Jadzia.These episodes were a very satisfactory introduction to the Brobdingnagian scope of Season 7.Speaking of Brobdingnagian, we get to see the crew of Worf and Martok's bird of prey ""The Rotarran"" (along with Quark, Bashir and O'Brian), destroy a Dominion artifact of Brobdingnagian proportions. And they do a wonderful number on the thing, it's beautiful. You have to remember a lot of this was practical effects, not CGI. Because they had a genius working on the Star Trek shows back then, Dan Curry.Which was amazing. But what would help put the icing on the cake of this episode would have been to see Benny Russell/The Sisko take that roller-brush and lavish Dr. Wykoff (Casey Biggs) with TWO coats of paint across his face!In my mind that's what happens anyway, when I watch this episode.",10
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Shadows and Symbols (TV Episode 1998)",Welcoming Ezri and honouring Jadzia,"After the opening episode of the season set up three story lines this episode shows how each of them plays out. Captain Sisko is pleased to see his old friend Dax again even if it isn't Jadzia but the new host Ezri, a young Trill woman who was given the Dax symbiont because she was the only Trill available and as she hadn't undergone the usual training she is still coming to terms with gaining the memories of all the previous hosts. As Sisko, his father and son and Ezri head to the desert planet of his vision to find the Orb of the Emissary other members of the DS9 crew are facing their own troubles. Bashir, O'Brein and Quark have joined Worf on his quest to get Jadzia into the Klingon equivalent of Valhalla, this mission involves taking on a the defences of the Cardassian shipyards which they plan to destroy. If two interesting story lines weren't enough we have a third when Kira learns that the Romulans are stockpiling weapons on the moon where they were told they could build a hospital, this leads to a stand off between the Bajorans and the far better armed Romulans.This episode has many good points; it gives us a great introduction to Ezri Dax, played well by Nicole de Boer, it can't be easy joining a well established ensemble cast were all the other main members have been there since episode one. It was also nice to see Quark doing something that wasn't for profit... even if he did complain quite a lot.",9
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Shadows and Symbols (TV Episode 1998)",The Sisko Regains His Reign,"We are treated to some new characters and situations. Sisko is at the top of the list. When he was made Emissary, I was suspicious that it was just through happenstance. He seemed to accept his role as a means of appeasing the Bajorans. I've struggled with the supernatural aspects of this series. Now, I'm beginning to see the prophets as beings not unlike the dominion or the Cardassians or the Founders. They seem to have powers that are in line with the rules of this game. This episode also shows what must be done with alliances of evil (the Romulans, in this case, who have asserted their strength, taking advantage of their allies. Colonel Kira plays a dangerous game with them.",10
5,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Shadows and Symbols (TV Episode 1998)",A re-watcher.,"You may have to watch this episode and the previous ones (and especially 'Far beyond the stars') a few times to fully understand the main story here. But that effort will be rewarded by a much greater appreciation for this one. Very well written science-fiction. Another fine one, as well as some nice sub-stories.",10
6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Shadows and Symbols (TV Episode 1998)",Mixed feelings about a mostly well done episode,"As a man who loves star trek since its incarnation, I have very mixed feelings about this episode. First, I realize that Ben Sisko is a religious figure to the bajorans, but his abject dismissal of his family is upsetting. Especially since he is the family Captain; something Kirk and Picard (My favorite) were not, for different reasons. I have no one to blame for this, especially since the effervescent Avery Brooks played his part brilliantly as usual. His dedication to the ""wormhole aliens"" was just a bit unnerving in this one, given his wonderful family.The other issue I have with S&S is that Worf shouldve grieved more heavily for his fallen love. I know many have brought this up with the subsequent films (completely warranted criticisms) but between Quark's whining and the rest of the rag tag crews banter...I just felt empty. This was the love of Worf's life, and he shouldve plunged a dagger in the ferengi's neck for his disrespect.I think this episode is a bad example of what DS9 has to offer. As a series it was a worthy follow up to the brilliant Next Generation, and vastly superior to the poorly written and badly acted tripe of Voyager and Enterprise. For a good example of what DS9 was: I suggest ""In the Pale Moonlight"" a tour de force performance by Brooks and a damn fine piece of Trek writing.",
7,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Shadows and Symbols (TV Episode 1998)",Some answers....,"The first episode of season 7 of ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" was a bit frustrating because it introduced so many plots but offered no resolution. Fortunately, this second season clears up many of these...and leaves a few still dangling.When the show begins, Ezri is showing that she is no Jadzia Dax. Ezri Dax is a bit afraid of flying on the shuttle and looks a bit panicked. Worst of all, however, is that you learn that she is a counselor--something that many Trek fans will despise!! Her full character will have to be revealed in subsequent episodes.Ezri Dax is accompanying Sisko on his vision quest to locate some new orb. I agree with one reviewer who disliked this plot, as Sisko was so obsessed that the folks he brought along (including his elderly dad) were unimportant and the scorching planet they arrived on seems ready to kill the old man...and Sisko is indifferent. Worf and his guy pals all are on their mission to somehow get Jadzia Dax into Sto-vo-kor by proxy. An odd notion indeed--and one requiring a brave deed in battle.The final plot involves Colonel Kira and a Romulan Senator having a run-in and neither seems willing to back down. Someone better, of the fragile alliance will be in jeopardy.The resolutions to these plots is decent--but I am not a huge fan of some of the encounters Sisko has with his Prophet friends. I did, however, find it fascinating just how long-term their game plan is and how he was NOT chosen to be the emissary by random chance. Interesting and worth seeing.",7
0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Afterimage (TV Episode 1998)",DS9 Goes Down Hill,"This episode and subsequently season are disappointing.They introduce a new character and decide that the she needs no attractive women. Keira was already a masculine looking 'female' with ugly short hair. Enter Ezri who is another masculine looking shorthaired annoyance. They replaced the pretty Dax with an ugly Dax who, moreover, is supposed to be a counselor but needs constant counseling.Yikes.",
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Afterimage (TV Episode 1998)",Short-haired nervous nelly,"This episode and indeed this season of Star Trek: Deep Space 9 suffers from the boring, annoying and ugly short haired woman that is Ezri Dax. If they wanted to replace Jadzia which was a little eye candy with someone completely the opposite then they succeeded. It is a mistake and the series suffers. Masculine women with male hair cuts probably appeal to a certain market segment, but the series already had the Lieutenant. Why have two ugly women?
The season improves slightly at its end, but fans like myself have to sit through the ugly women which makes no sense because after all television is fantasy and entertainment.",3
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Afterimage (TV Episode 1998)",Ezri arrives at DS9,"When Ezri Dax arrives on DS9 as she is surrounded by memories of her previous host Jadzia, it is also hard for Jadzia's friends who find it difficult to come to terms with the fact that their friend has died but all her memories survive in Ezri. Hardest hit is Worf who can't accept Ezri and makes her so awkward that she tells Captain Sisko that she plans to resign from Star Fleet and return to Trill. Before she can leave Sisko asks her to see Garak as he is suffering from claustrophobia which is preventing his vital code breaking work. Initially he isn't keen to open up to the young trainee councillor but eventually she gets to the bottom of his problem. She also confronts Worf and although things still aren't perfect between them Worf accepts her for who she is and not as his wife's replacement.I really enjoyed this episode even though there was little action and no real sense of threat, probably because it was centred on two of my favourite characters; Ezri Dax and Garak, who are played well by Nicole de Boer and Andrew Robinson.",8
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Afterimage (TV Episode 1998)",Ezri comes off as annoyingly lacking confidence...let's hope the writing for this character improves!,"The Dominion and Cardassians are involved in an all-out war with the Romulans, Klingons and the Federation. Life seems tenuous, that's for sure and at any minute the station could be attacked. So, in light of all this, ""Afterimage"" is a particularly frustrating and misplaced episode. Instead of deep and important topics, the main one explored here is that Ezri Dax feels unloved and unwanted by her fellow crew members as well as VERY uncertain about herself or whether she should remain on DS9. In addition, she talks about feeling space sick...which is a bit annoying. Although someone MUST have thought this would make her an endearing or interesting character, it just makes you wish that Terry Farrell had not left the show! Perhaps in a few episodes this won't be the case, but for now Nicole de Boer (Ezri) has a tough job winning over fans based on the character which was written for her. I know I sure felt frustrated by what I'd seen so far.Apart from listening to Ezri whine and act like a little girl*, Ezri does manage to help Garak a bit using her counselor skills. Poor Garak was an abused child and she helps him gain control over his fears. Plus, his bluntness enables him to say what most fans of the show were feeling--that Ezri should 'man up', so to speak. Also, Worf continues his quest to be the most annoying and grouchy member of the crew...and he's doing a great job!*One thing I LOVED about ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" over previous Trek shows is its female characters. In the original ""Star Trek"", women were mostly decorations for sexy outfits. In ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", they were just annoying--with Tasha Yar being a one-dimensional angry lady who goes on and on about rape gangs, the Doctor being very inconsistently written and Counselor Troi being too, too 'touchy feely' (though she did improve a bit over time). On the other hand, Major/Colonel Kira definitely came into her own as the show progressed and Jadzia Dax was one of the best characters. Let's hope Ezri can grow into something more...but her sitting and crying in this episode is NOT a good sign for the future!",5

5,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Afterimage (TV Episode 1998)","Psychological, subtle and profound","This claustrophobic episode focuses on Ezri's adjustment to her new circumstances and everyone else's adjustment to Ezri Dax and the casualties of the war.The Thrill species can have joined symbiotic relationship where the symbiant outlives the host. Ezri is thus the 9th host and shares the memories and feelings of the 8 previous hosts including Jadzia who was an integral part of the station and the show for the last 6 years and the wife of Worf. This particular situation makes for some great drama trying to figure out how to interact with someone who has the memories and feelings of someone you know but that isn't that person. This is what science-fiction does best and DS9 gets Les Landau to direct actors who are as familiar as they can with their characters in the show's last season and put new wide-eyed and confused Ezri Dax (and new actress Nicole De Boer) to thread the line between this complicated situation.Add Andrew Robinson as the enigmatic Elim Garak for character development and repartee, quirky Quark for warmth, brash Bashir for flirty friendship and bravado, as well as Avery Brooks' Sisko who not only knew Jadzia Dax but also Curson Dax, the 7th host. We have all the complexities of a great chess match and an episode that is perhaps match by ""Duet"" as one of the best Thrill episode ever. One of the best and most difficult episode all together when you take into account the 6 year backstory of all the characters culminating into this unspoken conflict (or conflicts).The dialog and story are strong but the beauty is really in the nonverbal nuances, the tone, the double entendre and deeper interplay. In that sense, the episode may be for DS9 connoisseurs instead of passerby, but it still showcase strong narrative impetus. Also it elevates itself by the quality of questions it raises and the satisfying yet not quite resolved resolution.Ezri is in search of herself, but we are glad we have found her. A great character and circumstances episodes to make Ezri Dax a solid part of the final chapter of this space saga.",10

I figured it would happen, but I didn't know what person would fill the bill. Enter Ezri who is a counselor. She is petite and very pretty. She was made a host because of unavoidable circumstances. This episode involves her integration onto the station. She has several issues. First of all, she has a devil of a time dealing with Garak's claustrophobia. He is hostile toward her and she is shy and vulnerable. Also, Bashir and Quark were carrying a torch for Jadzia who still inhabits her thoughts and memories. Worf, of course, sees her carrying his wife in her being. She has her ups and downs, but she is truly a strong woman. I hope her appearance is a good one for the series.",8
0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Take Me Out to the Holosuite (TV Episode 1998)",I love this episode,"It doesn't have anything to do with the storyline in season 7, but it's still a great episode. Being a huge baseball fan, I really enjoyed watching the DS9 crew learn how to play the game. Though I was rather surprised O'Brien knew so little about baseball since he's human. I'm not surprised at all that Rom and Quark didn't know the first thing about baseball since there's no profit in it haha. It would have been nice if the DS9 team actually won the game, but it teaches a good lesson in humility. The Vulcan couldn't understand why they were celebrating when they lost, but that's Vulcans for you. They don't know the first thing about emotions since they don't use theirs, so the idea of keeping your chin up after a loss is foreign to them. Overall a great episode that I highly recommend.",10

What a game!The team throws a party to celebrate their victory. Emotional Vulcan's are emotional. Nice fade out on the end.As filler goes this is as good as it gets.

I miss that.Verdict: Death to the opposition!",8
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Take Me Out to the Holosuite (TV Episode 1998)",Lighter episode that takes a break from the war,Amid all the darkness and despair of the Dominion War the occupants of Deep Space Nine get to have a bit of a break when the captain of a passing Vulcan ship challenges Sisko to a game of baseball. He readily accepts the challenge before realising that apart from himself and his son nobody else on board has any idea how to play. He has two weeks to teach his players how to play the game before taking on the Vulcan's who are naturally stronger and faster anyway.Being a lighter hearted episode there are a few good laughs; Odo practising giving people out was hilarious as was Chief O'Brien getting into the spirit of things by chewing gum... which he had flavoured with Whisky. I was rather surprised however that Quark wasn't running a book on the outcome of the game.I had expected to dislike this episode as I dislike most episodes which take place on the holosuite and I'm not that interested in baseball. However as I watched the story grew on me and the ending wasn't the cliché one might have expected.,6
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Take Me Out to the Holosuite (TV Episode 1998)",lightweight but amusing episode,"A 'comic relief' episode that takes you mostly out of the ongoing 'Dominion War' story arc of the last season.DS9 was already well past its prime by this time, but the characters were well-established, and the goings-on and subcultures and whatnot of a busy space station made for good background stories. In this episode, another badly-overused plot device, a holodeck, allows the crew to accept a challenge to a baseball game form an old associate of Captain Sisko, but that's not the fun part.The fun comes in the relationship between Sisko and his onetime colleague, between Vulcans and Humans.There seems to be a largely-understated antipathy between the races. Vulcans can be annoyingly condescending, while they find Humans utterly inscrutable.Sisko's Vulcan roommate in the Academy was a competitive rival with a clinical interest in human psychology. To Sisko's annoyance, he occasionally found himself the involuntary subject of his roommate's papers and theses.Years later, knowing Sisko to be a lifetime baseball fan, his rival challenges Sisko and his crew to a game. Sisko accepts the challenge. He knows the Vulcans will be studying his team (DS9 crew) and probably get a bit annoying, but he can't resist a baseball game and the crew needed a diversion...The Vulcan team, with no concept of 'fun', naturally plays to win. What other purpose could there be to play?Sisko and crew play to have a great time.Imagine the Vulcans' hollow victory, chagrin and befuddlement when the game is over and the DS9 team parties, celebrating its loss.",7
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Take Me Out to the Holosuite (TV Episode 1998)",Great episode to see the whole cast interacting,"I must say any negative reviews of this episode can not be made by a true Star Trek fan. This is quintessential trek.Take some alien sci-fi, mixed with some down to earth humanity, throw in some humor. Voila half of the original series followed that model in some shape or form.I would have given this episode a 9/10 except the ending struck me as hollow. It's a hilarious ending, with the crew taking jabs at the Vulcan, all the while his emotions seeping through his cold exterior. But then Julian hits the nose on the head ""To manufactured triumph!"" There is no real moral to the story, other than I guess that people can be happy and find solace in friends and family, even after a defeat. I just expected a more concrete point to the story.I guess ultimately it is meant to be light heart-ed, and the flimsy moral to the story serves to be light heart-ed as well.Also I love seeing the entire crew together on camera at the same time. Makes for a deep scene with lots of real emotion. The camera panning to ""catch"" Lita kissing Rom at the end is perhaps my favorite moment of the episode.",8
5,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Take Me Out to the Holosuite (TV Episode 1998)",Not Worth a Lot,"The Sisko/Vulcan rivalry is at the core of this. Sisko's lifelong Vulcan adversary has taught the game of baseball to his crew. They have polish and understanding of the game. Jake and his father are really the only ones who have a knowledge of the game. Baseball can be pretty complicated to one who has no experience with it. To play the game it takes some skills practiced over time. As a lifetime fan and player, there are some things that don't wash. One is Worf's inability to even touch the ball with the bat. He is the Zen master and has that second sight. I thought it would have been fun for him to hit a 500 foot home run. The others, for all their good intentions are as hapless as can be. It's an interruption from the intense issues of the war. But as a baseball episode, it doesn't do very well.",5
6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Take Me Out to the Holosuite (TV Episode 1998)","Pretty bad, sadly","While I like baseball, I really can't stand this episode. Like most things, the comedy can be kind of hit or miss. Worf's parts are often funny, but the rest of it is pretty bland. In terms of structure, the episode seems a little bit confused, and the plot itself is rather contrived. While Vulcans can certainly be annoying, the one in this episode pushes it farther than the usual Vulcan arrogance into very odd illogical, having apparently trained his crew to play a sport that's no longer even played by humans, just so he can rub it in Sisko's face when they win. While that seems like a pretty illogical waste of time for one Vulcan, how he convinced an entire team of Vulcans to do this, when they could be doing just about anything else, is totally beyond me. Also, while I can't really be nitpicky enough to hold it against the episode, it is kind of funny to watch Odo try to make second base calls from behind home plate. The camera doesn't very well hide the fact that he's way too far away, and Jake is between him and the base. Although Rene's dancing about to try and get a good look doesn't even try to hide it, so maybe it's an intentional, if subtle joke.Also, props to many of the actors for their attempts to look like they don't know how to swing a baseball bat. No one quite stands up to Nana Vistor, who apparently is genuinely quite bad at baseball, but it's a hard thing to fake, and they put a good effort into it. **Spoilers for the Ending**Ultimately the episode would just be a bit dull, unless you really, really like baseball, or the jokes hit home. What drags it down is the ending. After the DS9 crew has lost the game fairly badly (I would say pathetically, but, as a long time Royals fan, I've seen worse), they all meet up at Quark's bar for a round of drinks, when the Vulcan manager walks in. Rather than actually showing the team as being happy, having had fun in spite of losing, they all seem rather bitter instead. What actually looked like the crew having a good laugh suddenly turns into mocking the Vulcan manager, but without any undertones of good humor behind it. Instead of actually showing they can be cheerful in defeat, the whole thing seems to be a bitter, angry show of ""happiness"" and forced laughter, all done out of pure spite. Certainly the Vulcan deserves it, but instead of the episode showing us how humans aren't inferior to Vulcans because they can have fun even without winning, we see how humans aren't inferior to Vulcans because they can be bitter, spiteful, and pissy in the face of losing.",3
7,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Take Me Out to the Holosuite (TV Episode 1998)",Not into Baseball?

I know this isn't exactly a noble pursuit, but so be it. When it comes to ""Take Me Out to the Holosuite"", it's THE episode I remembered more than any other--and NOT for a good reason. I remember it as the absolutely worst episode of the series--one that is 100% irrelevant and which embarrassed me the first time around. Being a reasonably fair person, however, I am making myself watch it again--just in case my recollection is in error.When the show begins, you see Captain Sisko and his previously never mentioned arch-nemesis, some haughty Vulcan who commands an all- Vulcan ship for the Federation. Out of nowhere, the Vulcan suggests his crew battle DS9 in a baseball game--and Sisko quickly agrees. Sure, he loves baseball but the game is extinct on Earth and no one else on the station knows much about how to play--let alone beat the Vulcans.So, is it as rotten as I remembered? Yep. The episode is the epitome of the term 'lightweight' and is evidence that the series might just be jumping the shark! Too many more like this, and you'll be praying for the end of the series! Yuck!!And still my vote for the single worst episode of ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"".",2
0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Chrysalis (TV Episode 1998)",Doctor in love,This is another stand alone episode that doesn't advance the main story arc but concentrates on Doctor Bashir who is trying to cure a young genetically engineered woman called Sarina who has been in a catatonic state all of her life. She has been brought to the station by three other genetically engineered people who while brilliantly clever have personality disorders which make it hard for them to function amongst normal people. Once the doctor has performed the operation it is clear that she doesn't suffer from these disorders and she gets on well with Dr Bashir's friends and very well with the doctor himself who finds himself falling in love with her only to find that she appears to have slipped back in to her catatonic state.Alexander Siddig does a fine job as Doctor Bashir and Faith Salie did well guest starring as Sarina. I found the other genetically engineered guest characters somewhat irritating although that was down to the way the characters were written rather than the acting. Over all it wasn't a bad episode but I look forward to a return to the main story arc.,7
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Chrysalis (TV Episode 1998)",Meh,"I would not be assuming the mantle of Captain Insightful by pointing out that Statistical Probabilities, the episode where we were first acquainted with dr Bashir's genetically enhanced patients, was hardly worth a sequel. The characters were rather annoying and the show's view on transhumanism rather shallow.Despite that, this episode is slightly better, as there is less focus on the obnoxious characters - aside from them providing silly resolutions, with corny lines like ""you can't break the lows of physics but you can bend them"".The problem is that the main themes of the episode have received better treatment elsewhere - the loneliness of the genius is something that has been shown both in Star Trek, and DS9 in particular, since Bashir is not so different from Sarina, and elsewhere. For instance, there is an episode of House that goes pretty deep into it. Additionally, the whole plot is pretty reminiscent at first of the film Awakenings, although the show, understandably, hints but eventually backs away from that bleak narrative.In any case, the view of genetically engineered humans as human computers who can solve problems an hour after becoming acquainted with a field remainds naive.",6
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Chrysalis (TV Episode 1998)","Through a 2018 lens: stirring, challenging & profound","As the pieces began moving into position, I expected to loathe this episode. The cliches were lined up & waiting, it was obvious. And at times, I felt incredibly uncomfortable. How can someone so incomprehensibly intelligent by our standards be so devoid of basic understanding? But the way it played out was, at least viewed through the prism of 2018, remarkably compelling.Dr. Julian Bashir is a lonely, frustrated man. In our modern pop culture terms one might ascribe him the maligned titled of ""involuntarily celibate"", or someone who is frustrated at their inability to find a mate and, perhaps through lack of humility or self-awareness, places the blame onto their environment. They believe fate has conspired their unhappiness.There was Jazdia. Julian came onto her too strong (in her own words) & the failure of winning her love left him distraught for seasons on end. Being forced to watch her marry a Klingon, someone so unlike him; a lesser mind but superior physicality. His frustrations grew anew at the end of the previous season, culminating with her unfortunate end.But Jazdia is reborn in this season, as Ezri, who offhandedly informs Julian that had she not met said Klingon, she (as Jazdia) would've probably ended up with him. This was actually meant to foreshadow the character Ezri's own attraction (as well as her newfound confusion sorting the thoughts of lives past & present), but to Julian it must've ripped open one of his deepest wounds anew.In Chrysalias, Julian helps revive Sarina, a highly-intelligent beautiful woman, from a vegetative state. We brace for the inevitable: the lonely man, despite being a doctor treating a patient, falls hard for Sarina. It's creepy, it's uncomfortable. In 1998 that was probably less of the intention; in many ways, the self-awareness of mainstream romantic storytelling has matured by leaps & bounds since then. & Star Trek is smart, so the conclusion hits its necessary mark, but the navigation must've felt slightly less gaudy at the time.But now in 2018, one can't help but think of those involuntary celibates, the incels, the lonely men raging online at their inability to find a mate, and consider how they might act in such a situation. If you take that filter, and apply several strong dashes of naive innocence, you get Julian Bashir trying to woo Sarina. Only he doesn't woo her. He doesn't put the patient effort into wooing her. He *expects* romance, and because she is so indebted to him for rescuing her from her aimless slumber, she reciprocates. He kisses her first & she returns the kiss. He's happy but it's there for us all (& to the show's credit, Chief too) to see: the relationship isn't about *her*, it's about him. She's his escape from loneliness. He uses her to ease his deep-seated pain of failing to find companionship.I'm sure a lot of modern-minded people will see the ending as a somewhat superficial way to wrap up a fairly problematic story, but to me, the light touch made the whole more palatable. Sarina is able to let go of him & reject his absurd advances in a way that doesn't exacerbate his fragile state; she's undeniably the stronger of the two of them. She deserves our admiration while Julian deserves our sympathy. Being a man is easy, but sometimes it's excruciatingly difficult too, in ways that we men don't realize until we step back & breathe, focus & make sense of the moment. I think this episode presents that frustrating fact in a very compelling fashion.",9
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Chrysalis (TV Episode 1998)","Why did they do a sequel to ""Statistical Probabilities"" in the first place?!","One of the poorer episodes of season 6 of ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" was ""Statistical Probabilities""--a show featuring a group of genetically modified folks who were misfits and were forced to live in an institution because of their mental problems. Dr. Bashir became friends with these folk and the episode had MANY embarrassing moments because it was so poorly written. So imagine my surprise that they would do a follow-up--a follow-up that I assume many folks would NOT have looked forward to seeing.In this new episode, Dr. Bashir is surprised when his misfit friends show up on the base unexpectedly and in Starfleet uniforms. No, they are NOT members of the fleet--they are just once again social misfits who think this is cute. It isn't. Anyway, once they're on the base, somehow Bashir gets the idea to do some medical procedure to Sarina to try to bring her out of her mute and somewhat catatonic state. It is a success and almost instantly Bashir is smitten by her and is making plans for their lives together.This episode is embarrassing--as are most of Bashir's attempts to court women. The problems are that he has no real ability to engage in a normal manner with women--almost as if he has Asperger's Syndrome. He also has ZERO sense of ethics, as no responsible doctor would almost instantly begin hitting on their patient! Sarina's reaction to the ultra-creepy Doctor isn't at all surprising. And, it makes for a rather uncomfortable episode overall.",4

Its all down hill from 19 minutes on with the disgust really picking up right around 30 minutes in. By the time we get to the 40 minute mark I am ready to throw things at the screen.

But the real highlight here was Faith Salie as ""Serina""- it is like a light switch being flipped.This episode is mostly about her. All I can say about this character is that the title of the episode matches what happens to the character.And that brings me to my very minor complaint. This episode is a lot of fun up until about halfway, and then Bashir gets totally sidetracked. Probably because there was no more Jadzia for him to pine over, all of a sudden this episode is no longer an episode involving the genetically modified people, suddenly their characters are no longer the focus, and something else happens, everything gets suddenly very deep and in some cases tiresome, and we can understand something that Sarina does in this episode, because we feel it.I was hoping that the Biogenes would do something totally off or crazy like they did the first time they appeared, but after about halfway through, their appearance in this episode is reduced to practically nothing. Of course Bashir needs to consult them because something happens that they are familiar with, but that is basically the last time that we ever see them.It's not that I didn't like this episode but that it should have included more of the Biogenes. Mainly it's about Bashir making another incredibly stupid mistake (again).And we've had plenty of those kinds of episodes, this episode had so much potential but it didn't live up to all of it.

3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Treachery, Faith and the Great River (TV Episode 1998)",One of my favorite episodes,"I always loved Weyoun's character.

Odo takes a runabout to the planet he was told to meet his informant friend but instead, Weyoun is there waiting for him. Weyoun tells Odo that he no longer considers himself part of the Dominion and wishes to defect. Odo becomes irritated how much Weyoun worships him even though that's how the Vorta were programmed. On their way back to DS9, they are contacted by Damar and the new Weyoun clone and tells the other Weyoun to either surrender or kill himself. Damar wants the runabout destroyed but new Weyoun is hesitant because Odo is still considered a Founder despite the fact that Odo is essentially neutral. Damar eventually talks Weyoun into having the runabout destroyed and just not telling the Founder that Odo was on board. Sadly, the defecting Weyoun ends up activating his termination program in order to save Odo. I just didn't understand why Weyoun didn't fake his own death but that would have taken away the moment where we see just how much the Vorta look up to the Founders. He knew Odo didn't want to be looked at as a God but his dying wish was to receive Odo's blessing. The other plot line in this episode is that Chief O'Brien is ordered by Captain Sisko to fix the Defiant in a few days with a part that isn't on DS9. Nog helps O'Brien by doing trade after trade after trade to get the stabilizer. Things start disappearing on the ship like Sisko's desk and Martok's cases of blood wine that his wife sent him.

Everyone has lost a friend, everyone is scared and angry and everyone is doing their job with an air of fatality that is riveting. For the most part, the enemy are an unseen force that everyone knows is equally determined and skilled, and of course they must be dealt with.I particularly enjoyed Quark's role in this episode, an outspoken outsider who begins to understand more and more what his nephew and the other starfleet personel go through just because of orders and circumstance. This is a great episode that shows a rougher side of life in the future, and a rougher side to the characters we are so familiar with.

As they approach their destination they are attacked by a Dominion ship suggesting the area isn't as safe as they thought. Once on the ground they find things are much worse than they thought; the base is down to about a third of its original strength and it appears that some of the troops there have been in combat too long and are beginning to either cracking up or enjoying them selves a bit too much.While they are on the ground the Dominion attacks and Capt. Sisko decides that he and the rest of the landing party will stay and fight along side the other troops. This means Dr Bashir, Ezri and Nog must experience ground combat for the first time and one of them will sustain a serious injury which may effect them for the rest of their life.I found this to be a great episode, normally one feels the main crew will walk away from all situations unscathed but here there is a greater sense of danger.

It's recently been under siege for some time and the Federation troops there are disheartened and beaten up pretty badly. So, when Sisko and some of his folks arrive, they are very welcome. But the task of keeping this base seems impossible, as only about a third of the original troops are alive.An interesting guest star in this one is Billy Mumy, as he was once a regular on ""Lost in Space"" and was a regular on ""Babylon 5"" when he made this guest appearance. Overall, a decent episode, though I did feel their attempt to be grittier still felt amazingly sanitized compared to real warfare. Still, it's worth seeing.",7
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Siege of AR-558 (TV Episode 1998)",A grim Trek episode even by DS9 standards,"PLOT (heavy spoilers!!!)On a routine supply mission the Defiant has to leave after a Dominion attack leaving Sisko, Bashir, Quark, Nog and Ezri in a barren place holding an important Dominion communication's array, defended by a quickly diminishing group of stressed and fatigued Starfleet officers. It becomes clear quickly that these people are on the brink of mental and physical collapse. Quark tries to shield Nog but Sisko sends him on a mission that gravely injures him. Taking heavy casualties Starfleet holds on and finally get relieved by fresh troops. GOOD STUFFFor once this isn't the Enterprise destroying an opposing, heavily armed cough cough warship with one phaser beam or a great battle mentioned in stories. We get right in on the action, and much like Quark points out, these are no longer kind and calm Starfleet officers but weary and hostile animals, looking either for a way out or a kill to make. I love the dark setting, the barren rock that no one will ever hear of, the guest stars who make the most of their material. The action is believable and incredibly violent, at least for Trek, there is a real sense of danger and traumatic fighting. Quark steals many a scene, pointing out humanity isn't so sweet and nice when basic comforts disappear and war is all around; questioning Sisko's decision to send Nog on a mission; questioning whether Sisko even cares for his people; and staying with Nog distracting him. He makes a reasonable point that the Ferengi would choose to negotiate rather than fight an endless battle.I especially like Vargas and Reese. Very different but understandable creatures in a besieged war front. I love the idea of the Dominion using holograms to establish the position and strength of the enemy, and mines in subspace that can go off without any warning.Sisko sometimes becomes so angry he's almost scary. In those moments he's more real, more palpable than any other Captain. Avery Brookes may sometimes be called a Shakesperean robot when he acts out anger but I believed every bit of it.BAD STUFFQuark being send by the Nagus to inspect battle lines seems a pretty shallow way of just getting him involved. Why would Starfleet inundate the Nagus with reports? What the hell are they gonna do? Pay the Dominion to stop their expansionist, genocidal ambitions? The second Bill Mumy asks Ezri to hand him a tool you know they will flirt with or befriend each other. Wouldn't the Houdini mines also injure Jem'Hadar soldiers making them unusable in actual combat? More importantly, if Starfleet recognizes the vast importance of the array when and if their engineers can crack it, shouldn't they send some engineers? Your best engineer is in orbit, hello? Remember the massive advantage the USA had when they cracked the Japanese transmissions. It also seems a bit like a cheap plot device to give the least experienced crew members (Ezri, Nog, even Bashir) their trial by fire in this manner. I can appreciate them becoming better soldiers and proving themselves AND experiencing real warfare, but if the place is under constant attack why not bring Worf, Kira or O'Brien, experienced soldiers? Why not bring tough resistance-trained Bajoran soldiers? Why not send a contingent of tough Klingons? Hell, why not just hire some Nausicans. They love to fight. In the end, Starfleet goofs again by sending another group of inexperienced officers in clean uniforms and dreams of rainbows and sugar, rather than a battalion of battle-hardened super-soldiers. I mean the Federation duked it out with Cardassians, Borg, Klingon and Dominion in recent years, they must have an abundance of veterans.MILITARY PERSPECTIVEI have never been a soldier nor am I a military historian. I am however, feel free to believe or disbelieve me, a historian (University of Amsterdam, class of 2011) and I raise some serious questions on Dominion strategy. We always hear Jem'Hadar are super-soldiers and the Dominion are aces in tactics. Yet despite the ability to cloak soldiers, place subspace mines and bomb cities from the skies they simply just charge in the open and barely take cover. They have phaser-type weapons that they use as clubs. I can understand they won't bomb the structure because they want the array, but I do not understand the total lack of artillery. They found out the positions of the defending force, mull it over, then charge the positions. People, just use an artillery barrage. You can keep the array safe whilst inflicting heavy casualties without risking your own forces. But the 24th century seems to have forgotten artillery and they're proper fools. Give me even a 1860s platoon of soldiers, 3 Gatling-guns and two batteries of artillery and the Dominion will never come close to hand-to-hand combat.CONCLUSIONA very dark and good episode showing Starfleet in a very different light. The military quality of it is somewhat debatable and dubious but the action feels fresh and alive. It fools you into thinking it's a fun episode by having Rom sing as an opener, and then smack you down by getting in the blood and bombs filled theatre of actual war. This is what soldiers experience everywhere and it's hard to stay humane. Quark has some tough but true lessons for Nog and Sisko, our freshest cast get baptized in violence and gore, supporting actors shine, feel very real. It's a great episode that I truly think only DS9 could pull of, already a more dark and bitter show. No nice moral, no sweet ending, no ship ex machina - just real people battling for their very lives. Powerful stuff. 8/10.",8

The show's writers tried hard to get the point across, and for the most part they succeeded. Nog is battle-tested, and I find myself struggling after this episode to still see the obnoxious young Ferengi from season 1. His is a character who has grown immensely, and hopefully Quark has a better understanding of his nephew's desire to live up to the Starfleet standard.
Aside from that, there is battle, and Ezri gets to see if her memories of war have prepared her for what she's going to face. Overall The Siege of AR 558 is a strong episode in what's shaping up to be a very well-written season.",8
0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Covenant (TV Episode 1998)",The Cult of Dukat,"After a few episodes concentrating on the war with the Dominion this one switches to the secondary story arc involving Gul Dukat and his involvement with the Pah-wraiths; the Bajoran prophets' evil counterparts. After a brief introductory scene Kira is pleased to get a visit from the man who was her spiritual adviser during the time of the Cardassian occupation of Bajor. Her pleasure is short lived however when he transports her to a space station occupied by Gul Dukat and his Bajoran followers who have joined his cult. Once he has got his hands on Kira he attempts to convert her to his beliefs. He soon has problems of his own however when the first baby to be born on the station turns out to be half Cardassian... the Bajoran father is not convinced by Dukat's claim that the Pah-wraiths have changed the baby as some sort of sign.The story itself was good enough and the regular characters did a good job, I did however find the cult members to be rather unconvincing; they spent most of their time milling around and when they learnt that Dukat was about to betray them they all reacted in the same way when I'd have expected a mixture of reactions.",7

Of course, even though the planetary member fall for him, Kira knows what he is. The challenge involves her butting heads with her old friend who has fallen hook, line, and sinker for Dukat's gobbledegook. Also, the followers are unconvinced of her intentions.",8
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Covenant (TV Episode 1998)",I liked this side of Dukat...,"When this episode begins, a Vedek friend of Colonel Kira's shows up on DS9 and he soon arranges to meet with her. However, completely unexpectedly, he has her transported off the station and onto an abandoned station far away. Here is the weird part. At Empok Nor, there is a cult of Bajorans that worship the Pah-Wraiths (beings who are sort of like demons) and their emissary is Dukat!! In this role, Dukat is all smiles, joy, forgiveness and love--which the Colonel knows is a pile of crap since this IS Dukat!! But oddly his followers believe in him completely--as completely as any cult you could find anywhere. Eventually, however, the smooth-talking Dukat ends up creating his own downfall. So how does he handle this? Yep--he arranges for a mass ritual suicide! Can the Colonel possibly stop these idiots from offing their sorry selves and get them to understand that the Pah-Wraiths are NOT the true gods of Bajor and that Dukat is just an opportunistic wiener?I liked this episode a lot--particularly towards the end when Dukat suggests mass suicide! It was very timely in light of the recent mass suicides of the Heaven's Gate cult and it also opens up even more possibilities for Dukat to be a self-serving and evil slug. For more of this sort of nonsense which I love, be sure to watch the series to its conclusion, as Dukat and his insane message gathers a really, really interesting follower!",9
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Covenant (TV Episode 1998)",Gul 'Jim Jones',"This is an okay episode where we get to see Gul Dukat as a cult leader.He kidnaps the now Colonel Kira and wants to bring her into the fold. This is where the plot gets shaky a bit. Dukat has a good thing going, so why on Earth( excuse the pun) would he risk being killed by Kira? Why would Dukat risk Kira unraveling his lies by bringing her aboard Empok Nor? The devout believers were annoying as hell. Dumb and willing to believe anything their emissary says. However it does bring up the point about cults and why they are so effective at keeping control. Jim Jones basically did everything Dukat did and then some, IN REAL LIFE! So I can't fault the episode for portraying some of the dumber sides of humanity accurately. They were just a drag for me.I was so ready to blast this episode with a 6, but the fact that Dukat actually believed parts of his own lies, and prayed to the Pa Wraiths means that it fits into the overall season 6-7 story arc. It isn't JUST a one-off cult episode with no impact on the story. We will hopefully see Dukat psychologically affected by this in future episodes.",7
0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" It's Only a Paper Moon (TV Episode 1998)",This one surprised me with its depth,"""It's Only a Paper Moon"" is an episode that surprised me for two reasons. First, while I never understood why the show used the Vic Fontaine (James Darren) character, here he works fine. Second, I was shocked how good Aron Eisenberg was in this episode as he showed a much greater sense of depth to Nog than we'd ever seen before in the show.When the show begins, Nog has finally returned to the station after losing his leg in battle. While the crew is prepared to celebrate his return, Nog has no interest in this and he quickly departs for the holosuite. He is on medical leave and he plans on spending all of it hanging out with Vic in 1962 Las Vegas. However, over time, it becomes very obvious that Nog is avoiding dealing with his emotional scars and he cannot hide from everyone forever.I was seriously shocked that ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" could deliver a really good show about Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder--especially with a Ferengi going through the trauma. After all, through the course of the show, the Ferengi were mostly there as comic relief and the diminutive Nog isn't most folks' idea of a soldier. Still, due to excellent writing and Eisenberg's performance, it turns out to be one of the best shows of the final season. Well worth seeing.",10
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" It's Only a Paper Moon (TV Episode 1998)",Not all healing is physical,"When I saw that this was going to be another holosuite based episode I was expecting it to be fairly weak as there have been rather too many episodes set there in the various stat Trek series, thankfully this time there were no malfunctions or unexpected dangers just a good character driven episode where the self aware holographic singer Vic Fontaine helps Nog come to terms with the loss of his leg.Having returned from hospital Nog can't come to terms with the loss of his leg and even though the doctors say his new artificial leg is working perfectly he complains that it hurts and insists on walking with a stick. He gets counselling from Ezri but nothing she suggests seems to help; he just lies in his room listening to one of Vic Fontaine's songs. Eventually his neighbour Jake Sisko tells him to turn it off and if he needs to hear it he can go to the holosuite. Nog takes this suggestion literally and goes to the holosuite and after hearing Vic sing many versions of the song asks if he can stay with him. The longer he stays there the less he needs his cane but he also gets to the point where he doesn't wish to leave.Surprisingly this was a good episode and James Darren was great as the occasional character Vic Fontaine the 1960s crooner. Aron Eisenberg was also good as Nog, it couldn't have been easy acting under all that Ferengi make-up.",8

Vic tries to deal with Nog's issues, knowing that he is taking on a fantasy life that will come to an end at some point. Finally, Nog's friends and shipmates, gently move in and get Vic to agree to help get him squared away. Nog is so much more of a developed character than his buddy, Jake, who has been written as a slovenly nay-sayer.

As Ezri's family run a large mining operation in the area she is asked to see them and ask her mother if her contacts know anything about the chief's whereabouts. It is rather awkward for her as she hasn't been home for several years and a lot has changed for her since she joined with the Dax symbiont. The chief is soon found but by then Ezri has suspicions that lead her to believe that her family may be involved with the Syndicate in some way.While I often enjoy character rather than action driven episodes this one didn't really seem that interesting because Ezri's family wasn't particularly likable, I can see why Ezri left home and joined Star Fleet.

Soon a CONFIDENT and ASSERTIVE Ezri Dax shows up and you know she's from the alternate reality. It seems her friends have captured the Grand Nagus and will kill him unless Quark gives them a cloaking device--which they lack in this alternate universe.

It was also a bit of a surprise to see Ezri and Kira share a kiss; even if it was just their alternates.

2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Field of Fire (TV Episode 1999)",Mystery without a mystery,"This is the sort of story I'd have expected on ""Voyager"". It's utterly stale, inane, pointless (BY THE WAY, DID YOU REMEMBER THERE'S A CATACLYSMIC WAR GOING ON BETWEEN THE DOMINION AND THE FEDERATION-ROMULAN ALLIANCE?!) story with a payoff about as satisfying as being punched in the head after being told you have a surprise waiting.So a 22 year old Federation fighter pilot ends up dead on Deep Space Nine with a bullet hole through the heart and no powder residue on him. I'm only guessing this now because this was supposed to an important clue, and yet is never fully clarified until the very end.This leads to Ezri Dax on the case, out to prove how utterly incompetent Starfleet is......except the case is pretty much broken through and the mystery eliminated and left to merely room-searching the 900+ residents of DS9, which would be a whole lot less if the security did their detective work (which to their credit, they did do some of later on), when Bashir and O'Brian discover that the crime was essentially committed using a Federation projectile rifle prototype with a technobabble device that beams the bullet to the location desired of shooting it.Add to that a headset device that essentially acts as the FarSight XR-20 rifle in ""Perfect Dark"" in being able to see through walls perfectly and zoom in even right through people.So Ezri Dax goes through this tedious process of bringing out Joran, one of Dax's previous hosts, and goes through this incredibly boring pale-imitation-ripoff of a Hannibal Lecter-type lecturing of Joran trying to get Ezri inside the mind of a killer.All of which pretty much amounts to absolutely nothing as the final damning clue is established pretty much out of detective skills that would make Robert Goran of Law and Order CI and Sherlock Holmes combined look like child's play, or the Mary Sue inclinations obvious in a bad script---All the victims had pictures in their quarters of themselves and/or family, with people smiling or laughing.Therefore, the killer must be a Vulcan, they establish.Long before you can even begin to put together the logic (HURDURR) behind this assessment, LO AND BEHOLD, A VULCAN ENTERS THE SAME ELEVATOR EZRI AND HER HALLUCINATED-JORAN IS ON! And long before you can laugh it off as a stupid cliché' that MAYBE will be lampshaded, JORAN SAYS HE IS DEFINITELY THE KILLER! So rather than confront him, or get security to search his quarters for his gun, she goes to her own quarters, and uses the FarSight XR-20 to spy on him, catch him looking up her service record, and get HIS OWN FarSight XR-20 to put on. In a scene so blatantly obvious in coming, it has no shock value attached to it at all, they both spot each other pointing the guns at one another, and Ezri's shot hits while his misses her.In order to close the ultimately pointless plot line involving Joran, she confronts his wounded form in his quarters, seemingly about to kill him while Joran urges her on. Instead, she asks why he did it, and he says...""Because logic demanded it"" Any random assortment of words could have been put there that would have made more sense than that. Is this implying that this Vulcan is stupid enough to think of the concept of ""logic"" as some sort of deity, or a universal force like Chi or the Force? Or was there a whole subplot involved about his motivations seeming logical that was completely cut out of the episode that no one cared enough about to fix this loose end? It doesn't even matter anyway. The whole thing was as pointless as an average episode of ""Voyager""",1
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Field of Fire (TV Episode 1999)",Set a killer to catch a killer,"This stand alone episode finds the crew of DS9 searching for a killer who is using a rifle to kill people in their own rooms. There are many questions that need answering; why is he rifle when evidence suggests the victims were shot at point blank range? Why are there no powder burns? and why is he using a conventional rifle when everybody else uses phasers in the 24th century. While Odo and Chief O'Brien are investigating the technical aspects of the crime Captain Sisko asks ship's counsellor Ezri Dax to provide a profile of the sort of person who might commit such a crime. This causes her some difficulties as it forces her to confront the memories of Dax's former host Joran, a man who had murdered three people in cold blood. As she interacts with Joran she gradually gets into the mindset of the killer, while this enables her to close in on the killer it also brings out more dangerous feeling which she must control.I enjoyed this episode and found it to be one of the more memorable episodes of the series.

4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Field of Fire (TV Episode 1999)",I've seen worse but this one's pretty bad.,"All the stuff with Ezri performing the right of emergence to bring about an image of Joran (a previous host who was a murderer) so she could get into the killer's head is cliche and boring but that's not what brings my score to a lowly three stars. This episode has a bad case of amazing-tech-itis. There are plenty of episodes across many sci-fi shows where they get their hands on some amazing tech or knowledge and then conveniently forget about it for the rest of the series. This is one of those episodes.A micro-transporter on the barrel of a gun that fires titanium bullets is already a hard swallow but okay. We do have other evidence of precision transporting in Trek such as when they beam a baby out of the womb in Voyager or when they beam a tiny spy device into a bulkhead in an earlier DS9 episode, etc. But we can't stop there because how is our killer going to see what he's shooting at? I know! Magic X-ray googles!Not only can these magic goggles see through solid matter like bulkheads or people, but they can be zoomed so they DON'T see through objects at a certain distance. If they saw through all matter then surely you'd be looking through the entirety of the station into the blackness of space. So of course we need to be able to zoom the goggles. Is someone standing in front of a monitor you need to look at? Just zoom in through their body and there you go! Now you somehow have a magic invisible floating camera between that person in your way and the monitor in front of them.It's just ridiculous and thankfully they ignore this tech exists in every other part of Trek.

This episode is a prime example.Odo finds another changeling and ultimately has to choose whether or not to leave his life on DS9 behind to find more of his people who are not involved in The Dominion.I think all of us have been in both Kira's and Odo's positions when it comes to love and relationships. Kira is afraid that she is holding Odo back from what he really wants. Odo feels torn between his desire to be among his own people and his love for Kira.Kira knows that Odo is torn between his love for her and his desire to go with the other changeling. She doesn't want him to feel obligated to stay with her so she wishes him luck and lets him go.When you love someone you always want to be everything for them, but that isn't possible. There are times when we have to sacrifice our true heart's desires in order to keep our relationships going. To be able to love someone enough to let them go so they can be truly happy is not easy.In the end, Odo comes back because he realizes that, for the time being, he belongs with Kira.",10

Odo takes his new friend back to DS9 where some very troubling things about Laas begin to show themselves. Laas is extremely xenophobic and thinks that humanoids are horrible--and that changelings are a far superior life form. He also tries hard to introduce Odo to the notion of leaving the station and going off with him to find more changelings. After all, it MUST suck living among all these humans! Obviously things cannot remain as they are--and the two new friends' time together is destined to be limited.This is a decent episode and it helps illustrate the true character of the changelings--and how Odo is different as well as much like them.

Initially is is assumed he must be one of the Founders but he does not appear to be suffering from the disease that is effecting them and he claims not to have heard of them.Once back on DS9 it soon become clear that he likes humanoids far less than Odo and treats everybody with contempt. Having no time for the locals he tries to persuade Odo to join him in a search for the remaining non-Founder Changelings. Odo is not keen to do this as he wishes to stay on DS9 with Kira. Kira however worries that she is holding Odo back from what he really wants to do. Things take a turn for the worse when Odo's new friend Laas gets into a confrontation with a couple of Klingons which leaves one of them dead. The Klingons want him extradited but Odo believes he won't get a fair trial and was acting in self defence anyway... something Worf strongly disagrees with.The problem is rendered irrelevant when Kira releases the prisoner and tells him to wait on a nearby planet for Odo. He is disappointed however when Odo meets him there only to tell him he will not be joining him on his quest.Over all it was a fairly good episode although Laas was so unsympathetic is was difficult to care what happened to him, it was however nice to see Odo in the spotlight for once.",7

Loving someone from a minority makes it very personal and enables you to see past the differences.

And finally, he commits an act of extreme violence. Odo is left with a decision whether to give up his relationship with Kira and seek out the bigger world of his people.

5,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Chimera (TV Episode 1999)",I think that this episode is a successful portrait of nowadays' world,"I think the reason why Star Trek was a successful and influential TV series is that it is not just a show full of future technologies like starships or phaser banks, but it is also a thought-provoking one. The argumentations that had been taken in DS9 may be or not be meaningful in 1990s, it certainly is meaningful for us in 2010s. The prejudice acts in this episode, the changeling being assaulted and not trusted, the fear of Odo to perform shape-shifting in public, and the saying that he wouldn't do something, in this case meaning shape-shifting, that would let others feeling not well. As a homosexual boy my mom always told me to keep it to myself that I should not tell others that I'm gay, and by pretending that I am part of the guys who are heterosexual would do me some good. Odo's acts let him gain some friendships with solids, but that won't change the fact that he is a changeling and people just don't like that. I have straight friends but I seldom or do not talk about guys in front of them though they might talk about girls in front of me, and I know by the end that they could accept you as a gay doesn't change the fact that they might be afraid of you. This episode successfully portrayed that and other similar situations we now face in our daily life, supposing that even with the technology of warp speed it won't change the basic argumentations of social problems.",10
6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Chimera (TV Episode 1999)",Masterful,"There are two major themes at play in this episode, or rather, one theme at work in two different ways. People don't have much love for those that are different from themselves. In the Star Trek universe humanity has mostly overcome racism and bigotry, so much so that even different alien species can live and work together. Chimera places the edges of that growth as a culture, as a species, in sharp relief.The central players here are Odo and Kira with the rest of the cast playing one note versions of themselves to help drive the drama. Laas cuts right to the chase as he's too experienced to waste his time. Sisko and the gang are troubled by Laas for reasons they'd rather not face. There is a lot of ""show don't tell"" in the writing with just enough lay it out straight to properly frame the story. How Quark believably became this show's conscience is beyond me, but his role in this episode is pivotal as it saves the regulars from their limited points of view.The other lens to view this episode through is one of self acceptance with undertones, both overt and subtle, of the difficulties faced by those who feel homosexual love. This angle is made even more potent once you realize Odo has unknowingly infected Laas the morphogenic virus he carries. But the episode never feels preachy. The Odo/Laas relationship and Odo's internal conflicts feel genuine and relatable to anyone who feels out of place in this life.We are all prisoners of our own experiences. And yet we all have the potential to be so much more than the sum of our parts. While Odo is torn over who he is and where he belongs, it is Kira that drives the episode's final act. The chemistry between Odo and Kira is never more evident than it is here, and it is that chemistry that really makes this episode work.As much as I love TNG, character's didn't grow and change like this on that show. I could probably snarkily poke holes in this one if I tried but I just don't want to. Chimera is Odo's ""Far Beyond The Stars"" and its everything Star Trek ought to be.",10
7,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Chimera (TV Episode 1999)",The One Where the Writers Try Too Hard,"On the surface, this episode appears to be a competent if not overly exciting examination of Odo's personal issues. Within that context, I could rate this a solid 7. The problem is, the writers were so determined, so laser-focused on the moral of the story that they had to turn every character in the episode into an idiot. We can leave aside (though we shouldn't, I'm just keeping it simple) the fact that all of the Odo issues here have already been thoroughly, and a bit exhaustingly, examined in the arc with the female Changeling on the station during the Dominion takeover. (Y'all remember when Odo's behavior led to tens of thousands of Federation deaths because they felt they had to launch a suicidal desperation attack to save the minefield, and the fact that literally no-one, least of all Kira, ever calls him on the fact that he essentially got tens of thousands of people killed, right?) But let's assume those episodes never happened and DS9 desperately needed to plumb Odo's psyche and his feelings about Changelings and their relationships with the ""solids."" So we have an episode that addresses the issues of bigotry and personal identity and relationships. In order for it to work, the writers needed to:1) Make Odo an idiot. He literally doesn't seem to understand why a being that has expressed overt hostility toward every other lifeform on the station might not be welcomed with open arms. It doesn't occur to him that this same being, after expressing this hostility, after clearly declaring to Odo he wants nothing to do with the humanoids, might have ulterior motives when he went out among them. It doesn't occur to Odo that the being was acting in a deliberately provocative manner, not even when the being can't wait to use the fall-out of the situation to argue that Odo has misjudged them and should leave.2) Make Sisko and other senior officers idiots. They barely touch on the fact that the Changelings are literally trying to destroy them, and have come close to doing so through infiltration. They then leave that issue behind as if it isn't an extremely good reason for having serious reservations about a Changeling that doesn't bother hiding its contempt and loathing for them. They don't bother dwelling too long on that, and prefer arguing jurisdictional issues over the fact that had a humanoid done the same thing to another humanoid then, yes, there would still be an inquest. Their reticence to make this argument clearly perhaps hinges on the fact that, somewhere deep inside, they realize Odo is currently a blithering idiot.3) Make Quark the Voice of the Writers, where he clearly lays down exactly what the writers want the moral of the story to be. It's pompous and obvious, and at no point does anyone provide a more intelligent counterpoint, such as the fact that the other Changeling was deliberately trying to create an incident. No, it must be all about short-sighted primitive genetic heritage. The only reason people accept Odo (the very same Odo who has demonstrated his shape-shifting abilities countless times in front of these people without a single cry of ""WITCH! HANG HIM FOR NOT BEING LIKE US!"") is that he keeps a humanoid form. Makes perfect sense...to an idiot. Luckily for Laas, Odo is currently an idiot.The central tension of this episode was heavy-handed and even more heavily-contrived. What seemed like a harmless standard DS9 episode became a fairly unpleasant insult to the viewers upon close examination. The only time any of the characters behaved in a believable fashion was when Ezri, Miles, Julian, and Kira reacted like they'd just been confronted by a jackass at Quark's, which, of course, they had. One accompanied by an idiot.",4

While Bashir and O'Brien are watching Vic sing in his Las Vegas lounge bar something strange happens, the club's design changes and crowd appears and boos him off stage, then a couple of gangsters turn up and tell him the place now belongs to them and he that he must leave town. Not surprisingly the regulars aren't happy to see their holographic friend in trouble and try to come up with an idea to get rid of the gangsters. It turns out that the program has not malfunctioned but activated a jack in the box program which the creator had installed to keep things interesting, unfortunately the only ways to remove it are rebooting the the program which would delete Vic's memories or to interact with the program in a way that causes the gangsters to leave. They see a chance when they hear the man who bankrolled the operation is coming to town to see things for himself and get a cut of the profits... all the crew has to do is steal the cash before he can take delivery. As they plan the heist each of them has a role to play; Kira will distract the senior gangster, Nog will pick the safe, Odo will carry the cash out etc. All they need is somebody to take the job of being the high roller, the captain is approached but isn't too keen as he understandably isn't keen on the racial politics of 1960s Las Vegas.This episode was a lot of fun, the way they planned and executed the robbery reminded me of ""Hustle"", although this was made much earlier. I did feel Sisko's speech about racial politics was somewhat heavy handed given that we are meant to believe racism is ancient history for the people in the 24th century. This is a minor quibble though about an episode that kept a smile on my face.",8

But it seems that someone along the line in the last two years decided to depart from not only Star Trek way of addressing issues, but the whole role science fiction plays in revealing the modern world to us through metaphor. When Sisco throws his hissy-fit that he won't go in the holo-suite because blacks weren't welcome in Vegas in 1962 - they violate a raft of sci-fi and Star Trek no-no's. First of all, this is the very first time that human racial resentment has been carried into the Star Trek future. Sisco's angry reaction is of someone who has suffered racial bigotry - which is not the case in Rodenberry's future. We've moved beyond it. It makes about as much sense as O'Brien refusing to go with Bashir into his James Bond program because the British oppressed the Irish. Or Bashir refusing to go to the Alamo program because Arabs wouldn't have been accepted in early 19th century Texas. It's idiotic and it violates the truly color-blind approach humanity has reached in the Star Trek universe. Science fiction addresses issues indirectly - like the original Trek's story of the planet that was racially divided by people who had half black/half white faces - but each 'race"" had the colors on the opposites side of the face. Metaphor. Misdirection. That's how science fiction gets it done . . . not by throwing an Al Sharpton rant in the middle of the 24th century. Generally, it's a great episode and a lot of fun.

A few good examples was one show where the DS9 baseball team played a Vulcan team in the holodeck, a crime detective show featuring Ezri Dax and her alter-ego as well as this show which is a spoof of the old film ""Oceans 11"". Perhaps sticking with the Dominion and Prophets plots would have been wiser in hindsight.Bashir and O'Brien are doing what they love to do--hanging in the holosuite with Vic. However, suddenly something strange happens-- the club where Vic performs is taken over by mobsters AND the crew cannot just delete the mobsters from the program---they need to be more creative. So, they come up with a variation on the film ""Oceans 11"" and a group of crew members help Vic to seal the mobster's money--so that his bosses get mad and kill him. Does this sound the least bit like any of the ""Star Trek"" shows? Nope. And the entire show comes off as very forced and a bit stupid.

She exhorts him to 'stay on the path' and not to marry Casidy. If he doesn't follow her advice, misery will follow.The style of this episode and subsequent ones are almost like one long, long movie or soap opera--without and of the usual plots that are resolved by the end of the episode. As such, it's a bit hard to rate any of these shows individually.By the way, early in the show, Ezri walks into Worf's quarters and you hear lots of dialog between Jadzia and Worf--as she relives the past. However, the dialog you hear and the captions you see (if you have the captioning on) don't match at all. They are from different past episodes. Odd, huh?",7

We also have the rescue of Worf and the sexual tension between Ezri and him. The classic Hollywoood kiss is a cliche, where the two are fighting and end up on an embrace. This leads to their being distracted and getting captured. Dukat rears his ugly head again and has his face transformed. I wonder what they did with his giant neck. And, the Founder, continuing in her human-like image is slowly deteriorating as the Vorta trie to find a cure for the thing that is destroying their realm, their very essence.

Of course this is not exactly friendly territory so even if she does manage to find him she has to get him back to Federation territory.

The two biggest and most important plots concern the Cardassian alliance as well as Kai Winn's commitment to the Prophets. As far as the Cardassians go, this is the low point for the Union. The Vorta (and, in effect, the Dominion) seem to have less and less regard for their Cardassian allies--and it is becoming more obvious by the alliance with the Breen. You just wonder how much Weyoun 8 can disrespect and disregard the Cardassians until the Cardassians fight back and help the Federation. As far as Kai Winn goes, this is THE episode where she finally realizes her visions are NOT from the Prophets but from the Pah-Wraiths (the Bajoran version of demons). She is appalled and contrite...to a point. But when it comes down to it, her allegiance if governed more by a thirst for power than for what is right.Well made and really, really tough to score because of the style of plot.

This episode had some fun moments; Damar's reaction to Weyoun Seven's demise at the hands of Worf was priceless.I enjoyed this episode, the Breen are a good new villain, made better by the fact that we never see them as they all wear masks and clothing that covers every inch of their bodies, we can't even understand what they are saying, it appears that only the Vorta can understand what they are saying.",8

Meanwhile, the evil prophets are led by Dukat in disguise and he takes Kai Winn into his hands and drives her to reject her religion.

There is at least some good news for the Federation Legate Damar has had enough of the Dominion's treatment of Cardassia and announces that the Cardassians are to rise up and overthrow their oppressors, their first action is to destroy the Vorta cloning facility, something which rather disturbs Weyoun.This was another good episode which doesn't concentrate one any one character or even a single group of characters.

For no apparent reason (other, perhaps than to keep Martok from gaining more fame), Gowron has sent the fleet into several no-win situations. Now, he proposes yet another insane raid--one that will probably get everyone killed. The problem is that Martok is not willing to do what it takes to stop Gowron's madness and so the task is left to Worf. His solution is, to say the least, pretty extreme!As for the Cardassian rebels, Kira, Odo and Garak are out to capture one of the Dominion's ships which has the new Breen weapon. This is because with one shot it can destroy a Federation ship--and they need to get one of the weapons to examine. Finally, with no real success in finding a cure for Odo's illness, the Chief and Dr. Bashir come up with a nutty plan to flush out someone from Section 31 who can give them a cure.This is quite good like other shows in the series.

I was also amused by the scene where Bashir and O'Brien argue about whether the chief likes Julian more than his wife.",8
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Extreme Measures (TV Episode 1999)",The Unfinished Business of Julian and Miles,"Dr. Bashir discovers that Odo's disease was the result of germ warfare started by Starfleet's cloak and dagger organization, Section 31. After weeks of attempts at creating a cure, however, Bashir becomes frustrated as Odo lies dying in the infirmary.Chief O'Brien has a hunch that Section 31 might have a cure for the plague, or at least some research that might advance Bashir's efforts. Miles suggests to his war games buddy that they lure Section 31 to DS9 by having Bashir announce to Starfleet Medical that the good doctor has found a cure for the Plague. Showing that they both have spent too much time in the holo-suites, Julian agrees to the plan, and devises a way to coerce the needed information out of the operative that shows up.Luther Sloan - the only operative of Section 31 that has been identified, at that time, to Star Trek fans - shows up. And he frustrates the hologram warriors by showing that he's not so easily coerced.This is not a stand alone episode. This is episode seven in a nine episode arc that finishes business on DS9. And part of that unfinished business up until now is the unanswered questions in the relationship of Miles and Julian. Even though the episode creates a story time unique to DS9, it relies on what has gone before. Think of it as a necessary aside, or as gamers would say, a solo mission that would need to be completed before the final battle could continue; a.k.a, a snack break.This episode is a gift, and, by far, the best written episode in the final year, IMO. It is a character study that takes all three main characters seriously...so seriously, it hires one of the best character actors of his time, William Sadler, to play one of them, Sloan.This is not the first episode that delved into Bashir's virtual realities; but, whereas one of them, the season four episode ""Our Man Bashir"", tackled Julian's incessant need for escapism; ""Extreme Measures"" shows that he just has plain trouble with reality. There is a scene where a valedictorian Slone, under the influence of Bashir's device, admits that he has been a bad father, a bad husband, and a bad son in his drive to protect his universe from what he believes to be threats. That look on Bashir's face is of pure disgust. How dare his fantasy heroes have to make choices in life? (Garak told Julian that a spy's life was never as fun as his holo-suite choices, and their deeds never as honorable. Obviously, Julian never listened.) We already know that Bashir is a bad date from Leeta and Erzi. And from ""Dr. Bashir, I Presume"" we know he's a bad son. His excuses aren't as noble as Slone's. Julian's medical career comes easy for him. He's a born doctor. He's bad at life because he lives in his escapism. It's something that since episode three, Garak has been telling him to improve. But it's not till now that Julian must come to the realization that maybe he enjoys fantasy more than reality.Even then he hedges his bet. In the virtual world he admits to Miles that he stays too much in the Virtual World because maybe he likes Miles more than the reality that awaits him. But it's an admission made to get Miles to fess up to the same. Don't read too much into that. It isn't intimate. Julian just gets his kicks from controlling VR characters and over-matching his wits with someone who plays with him than he gets from interacting with real people.O'Brian is as obsessed with competitive gaming as Julian is. But in the other areas of life, he is far and above Bashir and Luther. He is a great Dad, a great Husband, a great son, a great coworker, a good soldier?...He elbows his way into the ""Section 31 Game"" because he recognizes that the doctor might be in over his head. The Chief is also confused by the valedictorian Slone, even though that speech sounds similar to final letters soldiers have made up to send to loved ones before a dangerous mission - letters Miles makes up for Keiko all the time.Perhaps the key to the Chief is not that he seeks escapism, but containment; or, better yet, a way for denial. He was once a soldier; and, he pointedly notes on several occasions that is a part of his life he does not talk about. Miles has frequently said that he has no idea how many people he killed during his commission; which makes him the only person on DS9 to not know their death toll. And he thinks the societies that he was warring on should just forget it now that the war is over - that means you Cardassia.It is obvious that O'Brian doesn't want Warriorhood as part of his make-up...even though that's what he did - like it or not - and that's what he's trained to do. I believe to keep this Warrior Miles in a controllable box, he has moved that part of himself to the competitive gaming world. And, fortunately, Julian is a great Virtual Game Master so that the Chief never gets bored.It's easy to spot the Alpha male in this relationship.This has been the most developed storyline in the DS9 years. It started with O'Brian tut-tutting Bashir over his making friends with Garak, escalated into friendly games of racketball; and morphed into Vic Fountaine, Julian's genetic engineering, and Section 31. It has been used as a foreshadowing technique (Remember the Alamo), various subplots, main story lines, and, here, an aside. For fans of the show, this should have been a great payoff.It was for me.",8
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Extreme Measures (TV Episode 1999)",Sloan's Brain,"The idea is a good one. To save Odo, Bashir and O'Brien cook up a plot to lure the 31ers out of hiding, assuming they invented the virus. The problem is that it works and then they have to do something.

3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Extreme Measures (TV Episode 1999)",One of the weaker episodes among the final episodes in the series.,"The final 10-12 episodes of ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" are unusual in that they tell one long story instead of the usual self-contained shows. Of all these shows towards the end, this is my least favorite--and its style is quite different from the rest. Instead of focusing on three or four plots equally, they focus for almost all the show on a bizarro plot involving Dr. Bashir, O'Brien and Sloan of Section 31. The way the show goes is something you may like--I thought it was pretty dumb.When the show begins, Odo is dying and has a great scene with Colonel Kira. The acting (especially by Nana Visitor) is superb and the make-up is amazingly good.The bulk of the show is the Bashir/O'Brien/Sloan plot. Sloan takes the bait offered by Dr. Bashir and arrives on DS9. He is surprised when he is taken prisoner and interrogated. However, being the good spy-guy, he activates a suicide device. Fortunately for the plan, O'Brien and Bashir manage to keep the guy briefly alive so they can crawl inside his head to get the information. This crawling inside is REALLY dumb, as they go on a journey into the consciousness of Sloan and it really made me cringe. Overall, not a terrible episode--but one that could have been done better. Plus, at least you can FINALLY head O'Brien and Bashir profess their love to each other...of sorts.",6

While there they see a report stating that all of the resistance leaders including Damar are dead. This gives them the opportunity to prove to the people that he is still alive and fighting by attacking a Jem'Hadar barracks; it might not be a major target but it is enough to show that the dominion lied and encourage to general population to rise up. Realising the war isn't going too well the resident Founder suggests that Dominion forces fall back to their core systems believing the Federation will not continue the fight if the Dominion ceases its attacks. Back on DS9 when Quark gets a message indicating he is to be the next Nagus he is initially pleased, until he learns that the old Nagus has passed a series of unferengi laws which limit the way people can do business and introduce such terrible ideas as taxation and workers rights.The two story lines provided a nice mixture of drama and comedy, Quark's speech at the end is a classic.

It's pretty garbled and fuzzy but the guy tells Quark that he's coming to DS9 to appoint HIM the new Grand Nagus! Naturally Quark is thrilled but soon looses his excitement when he learns several things--one of which is that the constitution has been changed and Ferenginar is now a much more egalitarian and less greedy place...and Quark no longer knows if he even wants the job. There is MUCH more to this plot line but this alone is plenty of reason to see and enjoy this one.As for the war, the Cardassian people are told a lie by their Dominion overlords that Damar is dead. He isn't--and he and his rebels are planning on making that well known. Can they manage to mobilize the Cardassian to rebellion?The rebellion is important because the war has turned decided against the Dominion. They've withdrawn their forces out of Federation, Klingon and Romulan territory but they also are trying to consolidate their forces and take the Cardassians down with them if needed.The show ends on a surprise...Casidy is pregnant.

Even when I read the book version i couldn't stop myself. The acting in it is so good that I really felt what they were going through as the friends all parted for the final time. The writers did an excellent job and the actors an even better one. The only thing letting it down are the occasional special effects that could do with some work. Cirroc (Jake Sisko) did an excellent job, with the final scene of him looking out into the stars sending me to tears every time.

Unluckly I just finished the last episode and now it's over... I must say I am a little sad. It kept me busy after work for a long time and now I miss them all: Captain Sisko, Odo, Bashir, chief O'Brien, Kira, Worf, Jadzia, Jake, Quark, Nog, Rom, Leeta, Garak, Dukat, Martok and above all Ezri (Nicole de Boer is really special). Thank you all. A really good job. The last episode (""What you leave behind"") is the perfect conclusion.

2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" What You Leave Behind (TV Episode 1999)",The End of an extraordinarily brilliant show,"This is by far my favourite season/show finale of all time. I may have never been as sad and as glad at the same time. Sad, on the one hand, because my favourite TV show finally concluded and was most likely not to be continued (e.g. in a movie), but immensely glad, on the other hand, because they did it well and tied up most of the loose ends.Big spoilers ahead -After 3 seasons with (almost) constant war in it the UFP together with the Klingons, the Romulans, and a little Cardassian help finally defeat the Dominion. Yet, this was no war period but rather an anti-war period. When Admiral Ross and Captain Sisko refuse to drink Martok's Bloodwine over the dead bodies of Cardassians, and in the same way at the signing of the peace treaty on DS9 it really shows two of Gene Roddenberry's major ideals, namely the importance of peace and coexistence. (Whilst some movies are heavily disputed as either war films or anti-war films, I think that Star Trek has never been the former.)-Big, big spoilers ahead...- The characters did get what they deserved. No other season/show finale allowed their protagonists to leave the stage with more grandeur.* Cpt. Sisko - We learn that saving Bajor (..and the Alpha Quadrant..) was only a preliminary for his destination of being with the Prophets.* Odo - He ultimately decides to rest with his people in order to cure them from their previously contracted disease. His parting from Kira was in a way sad but definitely not unhappy or sorrowful.* Cmdr. Worf - The former longtime outcast from the Klingon Empire is offered the position as ambassador on Qo'noS at Martok's side - the man he had helped to become Emperor. A proper fortune for such an interesting character.* Chief O'Brien - Knowing his friendship with Julian will survive the distance to Earth, the Chief accepts a position at Starfleet Academy. And he deserved it. Having worked on the Enterprise D under the command of Picard and having been Chief Engineer on Deep Space Nine this path was inevitable.Of course, they didn't send everyone away from Deep Space Nine (Kira as Station Commander, Julian, Ezri, Jake, Garak and Quark seemingly stay), but these incredibly well written and performed goodbyes really leave you with a comforting feeling. Especially after more than 10 years the toast of Benjamin Sisko is as touching as it is true in my case: To the best crew any captain ever had. This may be the last time we're all together. But no matter what the future holds, no matter how far we travel, a part of us... a very important part will always be here, at Deep Space Nine. ...because a very important part of me will always be at Deep Space Nine, too.",10

After a brilliant seventh season the culmination of all events leading to this unmatched space battle and Sisko's discovery of his fate and his future with the Prophets. I agree, this is heart rending stuff and when all depart for their various new locations I had a big lump in my throat as I'd loved this lot from day one. Killing Damar was a pity as he really came through for Cardassia but I suppose it'd be silly to assume all would live through to the end. Ben Sisko's fortune was a puzzling one. Left wide open to be followed up only never to be..... I hope that the writers will one day chose to keep all fans happy and continue this space epic. Brilliant end to a seriously underrated show. The final scene with Jake Sisko staring wistfully into space at the wormhole was real touching. His relationship with his father was one unlike anything I'd ever seen in any show.",10
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" What You Leave Behind (TV Episode 1999)",Greatest Star Trek ending ever,"Clearly free of the influence of Gene Roddenberry since he has died before this was broadcast. This series is far more about spiritual values and allows each of the characters to grow and mature individually. Instead of facing a new and contrived crisis each episode we can see the ongoing relationships among the various characters and frankly one must see more than a single season to see the connections and growth. Because of this the depth of caring we have for the characters is far higher, and this final episode is just overwhelming in its emotional contents.Unlike all the other star Trek series, this one actually comes to a real and genuine close, each character's growth lines, all the various relationships come to a new stage/end. There is no ""going off into the sunset"" cop out ending like all the other Star Trek series and the feeling created in the true fans of this story line is traumatic, ""it's over"" leaving a void where a dear beloved series lived. I also have a tear in my eyes when I view this last episode. I bought the whole series on DVD before Netflix came out and now I have access whenever I want.Others have noted the lack of care about the Voyager series but when one looks in on the final for that series it is a cheat, little emotion except anger over how it is broken and thrown together and probably because the writers/actors just got tired of doing it all.Both the original series and Next generation were the ""going off into the sunset"" ending as if future movies would automatically come for them and pick up their story lines which they did. Not so for Deep Space Nine, the mold was broken and there will be no movies to follow. It is complete, done, Fin and no more needed, sad to lose a friend but OK since we know it could not have been better.",10

The first part shows the final battle and the ultimate defeat of the Dominion then the action moves back to DS9 where the crew get together to celebrate the end of the war and say good bye to friends who are moving on to other assignments, although not all of them wish to say good bye, leading Odo to try to slip off with Kira without being noticed; in a rather touching scene Quark manages to say good bye and show that he will miss his old adversary. Sisko on the other hand doesn't get a chance to say good bye to everybody as when he sets off to the Fire Caves on Bajor he has no idea just what he will have to do to prevent Dukat releasing the Pah Wraths.This was a really great ending to my favourite Star Trek series, it was nice that it took to time to let us see all the main characters one last time and to get an indication what each of them will be doing after the series ended. As to the meaning of the summary line... you'll just have to watch the episode to know the significance of Minsk.",10
6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" What You Leave Behind (TV Episode 1999)",Too much stuff for just one episode--and a very satisfying ending to the series.,"This episode of ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" is chock full of conclusions to all the dangling plot threads throughout the show. You'll learn what happens to Cardassia Prime when the people rebel, how the war with the Dominion ends, whether O'Brien and Bashir get married, how the Emissary saves Bajor, what happens to Odo and Kira and much, much more. However, be forewarned--it is an emotional roller-coaster and you may just want to have some Kleenex handy. I loved 99% of the show, though as usual, while I loved James Darren's acting and singing, it did leave me wondering WHY he was on the show in the first place!! Overall, extremely well written, very exciting and just about everything fans could want in a finale--hence this explains why this final episode was the length of two normal episodes.",10
7,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" What You Leave Behind (TV Episode 1999)",A great finale - up until the sorcerers and mount Doom,"The ending to the Dominion war, which makes up the bulk of this 2-part series finale, is excellent - from the Cardassian rise up (nice to portray them positively in the end) to the final battles, it was a very satisfying conclusion to the main storyline. The final departures of characters, with Worf becoming an ambassador, Odo returning to his people and O'Brien going back to Earth, were also bittersweet, and it felt like saying goodbye to good friends.The only part that didn't work well in this final episode was the same part that had been going wrong for a very long time now, and it is the Prophets / Bajor storyline. Here at the end, we continue to have the most iconic science fiction franchise shoot its own leg with what transcends the - albeit blurry - borders of trekobabble and goes straight into magic. Godlike aliens like the prophets were nothing new in the Star Trek universe, but their evil enemies called Pa-wraiths spelled trouble from the start - culminating to a plot where they are released from a cave through a magical incantation found in a forbidden tome (which released its secrets after spilling blood on it), and possess Gul Dukat. Sisko pulls a Gollum, jumps with him in the raging fires and....well, clearly, the magic book burned, so the evil wraiths were banished back to hell, and Sisko was saved by the prophets and trasnferred to the wormhole. It is a sad and nonsensical affair, but not enough to take away from the main story. However, it is a total waste of what was, along with Garak, the most interesting recurring character of the show. Gul Dukat was a fascinating character as a narcissistic war criminal, with lots of layers to his portrayal. This last season's transformation into a possessed Satanist made the last confrontation with him anticlimactic.",8
8,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" What You Leave Behind (TV Episode 1999)","Good acting, but the whole DS9 storyline sorta sucks","By that, I mean the entire plot about gods and prophets. Too many cases of *Deus ex machina* pop up in this series. Star Trek has always been about humans evolving beyond the severe limitations of religious belief. TOS dealt with this often: the Apollo they meet on their voyage was a member of an alien race that once visited Earth and helped kickstart civilization. The Metrons and Organians, who had evolved beyond the need for corporeal existence and existed as pure mind energy. TOS recognized them as evolved alien races that may have appeared to have been gods, but were just more advanced.DS9 turns it all on its head. Prophets and gods return with their deity to the fore, the Bejorans are obsessed with these supernaturals who exercise power over them. Miracles happen, like when the Dominion forces are destroyed in the wormhole when facing down a lone starship. Yeah, it's the big flaw in this ""spiritual"" series.",
9,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" What You Leave Behind (TV Episode 1999)",The last episode is like artificial flavoring,"Like artificial flavoring, it has good elements but leaves an unpleasant aftertaste. The change in direction toward the beliefs in the prophets in last season or so was weak. It went from using the beliefs as allegories for challenging blind faith and so on to a level of supernaturalism which seemed like promotion for the methods of belief which were criticized in earlier seasons. And the whole ""the book was the key"" idea was trashy. On top of the excessive hocus pocus elements, the last episode had way too many deus ex machina moments. Even the Founders' leaders positive transformation seemed to be a cheap way to end a story arc which stretched across seasons.It least it did not involve a hokey time travel finish like other series. But it still seems cheap in the end. Honestly, it seems to me that the powers that be have terrible difficulties with ending series with good stories.",4

I had good fun with the actual war stuff. Of course, there are so many impossible last-minute rescues and plot contrivances. But this is really as much fantasy as science fiction (the business with the prophets and their magical qualities). But the bad thing about a loooooooong final episode is that everything needs closure. At least some of the characters are staying behind and continuing their lives on the station. But we are treated to syrupy farewells, one after another. But I was told years ago that this was a good series and I would agree. It almost always kept me engaged and I got to know the people really well.",9
11,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" What You Leave Behind (TV Episode 1999)",Overrated at One Star!,"One great line in the entire interminable, maudlin marathon! I literally had to force myself to watch the last 30 minutes of this tiresome, self-indulgent episode, because I'd watched the rest of the Dominion War arc and didn't want to leave the last hurdle uncleared. This episode was so bad it made the last TOS episode, Turnabout Intruder, look like a landmark television masterpiece. Very difficult to determine what was the worst aspect to the episode: was it the sappy Kira/Odo ending, the embarrassing O'Brien/Bashir bromance, the endless cliffhanger BS with Kai Winn and Dukat, the schmaltzy last night at Vic's, or the totally disappointing end to the war with the Dominion. Finales are often a letdown, and I was never a huge fan of DS9 in general, so my expectations were not sky high, but really this was mawkish, dreadful muck. The only worthy moments were with Garrick and the last of the Weyouns. I thought Garrick's realization that he was back on a devastated Cardassia was a fitting reminder of the cost of war and his malicious glee in having killed the last of the Weyouns (""I was hoping you would say that"") could not rescue this awful episode. It could have been 15 or at most 20 minutes long, and one wouldn't have missed anything worth watching. Having watched the Dominion War episodes, and especially this contemptible loser, will insure that I won't bother with the rest of the series.",1

Once there they beam a bomb down to the surface. Unfortunately for them it detonates while they are still too close leaving them stranded deep in enemy territory with no warp drive. Back on DS9 Kira is pressing Weyoun to allow the Bajorans to run station security again. At first he bows to Gul Dukat's suggestion that having armed Bajorans on the station would be dangerous, however when Odo asks he he can't refuse... he does have a request of his own however.This was a cracking start to the new series, I can't think of another which started with things looking so badly for the Federation. It was a nice surprise to find that those left behind on the station were all well and hadn't been harmed, even Jake Sisko was being treated well even though he was upset that Weyoun wouldn't let him send his 'biased' reports back to his Federation newspaper. There was a little bit of humour to lighten the tone such as when the crew discuss the problems with the Jem'Hadar ship; no chairs, no view screen, no food replicators and no sick bay.

Additionally, more ships are waiting to come flying through the wormhole to assist in the attack. So, Sisko orders his folks to mine the entrance to the wormhole with self-replicating mines--perhaps, if needed, this can cut off these additional ships.

First, the Defiant and their Klingon friends are going to try to take out a station that supplies Ketracel--the drug needed to sustain the Jem'Hadar soldiers.

1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Rocks and Shoals (TV Episode 1997)","A tight setting for a tight, well done episode. Worth watching.","I had to write a review for this, because it is one of my favorite episodes of a very, very well put together TV series. So, here we go.This one starts off with Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks,) his Chief of Operations Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) and their small group crash landed on a small planetoid, where they run into another similarly cut-off group made up of enemy troops. This one reminded me a bit of some of the classics like ""The Outer Limits"" where a very complex plot that said a lot got into an hour long show (including commercials) which stood very well on it's own. Or, some of the Original Star Trek's episodes.In a TV series, there is often the question of ""story arc"" vs. ""stand alone"" episodes. Ones where characters develop along a progressive track vs. ones a person who hasn't seen an episode can instantly get. Deep Space Nine had some significant arcs, but this is a show that works well in both ways I mentioned.In the show Sisko comes to get to know something about a couple of the enemy troops, I won't go further, and it is a very tight and well written plot about wars, commanders, loyalty and the collision of respect for a foe and duty to one's men. Also, instead of action across solar systems or galaxies, the action is now restricted to walking distance of a small area of a small out of the way planet. Everything is tight for our characters here, including time.For the fans of the show watching, all the actors on board give good performances. It is also kind of chilling to see Nog, once a boy on the station and now a soldier, partner up with Mr. Garak, sent by Sisko to observe him, stay close to him, and learn. This isn't about our friend Nog going to see how Garak stitches a shirt either, and it says something about the best of our young people and sending them to learn certain things when their lives and ours are on the line. It is something that works in the story as a stand alone, sending a younger character out with someone known to be skilled, but for those who have followed the show and know both characters it is increased in the impact. Also, Colm Meaney does very well, from his work with a couple guest actors on his crew to his work with the regulars. His part where he is arguing to err on the side of humanity if one must err at a certain point is fascinating.Also aboard and adding to the anthology feel are a couple of guest actors who really inhabit their well-written characters. DS9 had a lot of that, and Phil Morris as Remata'Klan and Christopher Shea as Keevan (OK, forget the funny names and makeup, just watch it for acting and character and you won't be disappointed) are no exception.I won't spoil it further, but this is a very well done show that takes the concept I explained of the two small groups and which really makes you think. For a show which might have been considered part of an arc it really stands on it's own.There is one difference between this show and the classic episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits."" No narration. However, Avery Brooks' tone of voice at the end delivers all the summary that is needed.Worth watching, there isn't a bad performance in it and the writing is great. It also points to a lot of things about duty, command, and the burdens of both.",9

They come under attack by their own Federation and crash on a planet in a desert area. So do some Jem'Hadar and their Vorta. Because of injuries, the sickening Vorta makes a kind of deal.

0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Sons and Daughters (TV Episode 1997)",The one where Alexander returns...,"'Sons and Daughters'~ Season six, episode three.This episode explores the precarious bonds between parents and children as we see Alexander, the now adult son of Worf, return as a recruit on a Klingon ship that his father is serving on. Meanwhile, on a DS9 that is still occupied by the Dominion and the Cardassians, Ziyal tries to foster a friendship between her father Gul Dukat and Kira, who is intent on forming a Resistance to fight back for control of the station.We haven't seen Alexander since he was a pre-adolescent boy in TNG and I had wondered if the producers had forgotten he even existed until this episode. In 'Sons and Daughters', however, he is no longer the child determined to embrace his human side and is instead desperate to be accepted as a Klingon and is bitter that his father never pushed him more in his childhood to learn the warrior ways, skills he is now lacking and leaving him struggling to be accepted by his Klingon peers. This offers a very interesting insight into the characters of father and son since in TNG, Deanna Troi often made Worf feel inadequate as a father for being so hard on Alexander while encouraging the boy to be human. Yet this episode makes it clear she was wrong to interfere in the father and son relationship whose culture she did not fully understand. It is a turn on the portrayal of Ben Sisko and Nog where Sisko did not approve of the way Nog was being raised yet did not interfere until the boy was old enough to decide for himself, resulting in a young man who became both comfortable in Ferengi and Federation culture.Equally as compelling is the storyline set on DS9 where we see Ziyal further fleshed out into a likable, if slightly naive character torn between her love for her father and her sororal relationship with Kira. It is becoming continuing apparent that something has to give at some point, especially since Ziyal is also aware that Dukat is not a very moralistic person and her own allegiance has to lie with the Bajorans/Federation.All in all, this is a well-depicted character-driven episode that nicely deals with familial relationships before the action-packed episodes that are to come later in the season.",8

Alexander was tossed aside by Worf years before. He shows up as a recruit on board Worf's Klingon battle cruiser. For most of the episode, he is a liability and a bit of a buffoon. Everything he does displeases his father; he cannot win. We are privy to the struggles of these youngsters. A decent episode.",7

Alexander clearly has issues with his father and these are made worse when Worf breaks up a brawl between his son and another Klingon. It is clear that Alexander doesn't have what it takes to be a warrior but he still insists on staying on the ship when Worf orders his transfer to a cargo ship.Back on DS9 Kira is pleased when Dukat's daughter Ziyal returns to the station; she may dislike her father but she is close to Ziyal and he is grateful for the way she has treated her. It seems that they are getting closer but when he gives her a beautiful dress her initial pleasure doesn't last long and she returns it, he shows his true colours when he hives it to his daughter acting as though it was meant for her in the first place.This was a decent episode with two good plots even if Alexander seems rather whiny for a Klingon; it is no wonder the rest of the crew treats him with contempt. Pleasingly Alexander didn't suddenly reveal himself to be a great warrior but he did earn the respect of the crew and learnt to laugh at his mistakes with them. The secondary story was the better to my mind with Kira being put in an awkward position as she finds herself becoming closer to her enemy because she cares for his daughter.",8

I generally really liked him but also noticed that he was clearly the worst parent in the history of the series' regulars! When Alexander was revealed to him ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" as his son, he seemed very uncomfortable with parenting and ALWAYS behaved as if the boy was a disappointment. Now, several years later and on ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"", he's even more disappointed and seems to be a completely horrible parent--even by Klingon standards!The show begins with Worf serving aboard Martok's ship. To his complete surprise, Alexander shows up as a replacement crew member-- and IMMEDIATELY Worf shows his displeasure. As for Alexander, he's unsure of himself, wimpy and a screw-up--and soon the crew is not only riding him but letting Worf hear about this! As a Klingon, naturally this will result in Worf beating the crap out of the crew members, right? Well, not really, as Worf offers the boy no help and tries to get him off the ship! The only understanding one is Martok--who proves himself to be a real stand-up guy!The parallel story has a similar sort of plot. Dukat is embarrassed that the evidence of his dallying with Bajorans is alive and well.

When Odo finds out Kira and the resistance had organised the theft he is not pleased as he'd advised against such an operation thinking it would endanger the Bajorans on the station. When another shapeshifter arrives on the station Odo is somewhat surprised and after he links with her Kira is concerned that he is being manipulated. When Quark hears that the Cardassians have come up with a way of deactivating the minefield the resistance come up with a plan to thwart them; this however goes horribly wrong when Odo chooses to link with the other shapeshifter rather than deactivate the security system which leaves Rom in a prison cell when the Cardassians catch him.Back on the Defiant Sisko is given a new mission as Star Fleet have discovered why the Dominion have been able to do so well; they have a sensor array which lets them see all movements in five sectors and it even sees cloaked ships within two light-years. Sisko won't be leading the mission however as he has been promoted to a headquarters position, the job of leading the raid has fallen to Commander Dax.This was a good episode with two quality stories, it was interesting that they chose not to show Dax's mission against the array but to show Sisko worrying back at base. I know it was probably done for cost reasons but it did work. I like how the two totally separate parts of the story have developed so far this series without any communication between those left on the station and those with the fleet. I was really surprised by the ending, I didn't think Odo would abandon his care for his friends so easily; I look forward to seeing what happens next.",9

3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Behind the Lines (TV Episode 1997)",Stupid and inconsistent plot,"This episode is a perfect example why the writing in DS9 (apart from some quality bits involving the Cardassian and Ferengi related episodes throughout the series and the Dominion war arc that's basically the only interesting thing about the show) is simply below par and inferior to, say, TNG. While the majority of the episode is reasonable in describing the Defiant missions in the war against the Dominion, the resistance cell actions on DS9 aka Terok Nor, it fails miserably at the end, in terms of keeping the Odo character consistent with the previous 5 seasons. The latter alone destroyed both the episode and its conclusion, really.Without spoiling it, it's simply inconceivable that a character that devoted his life to justice and, by extension, peaceful resolution to disputes (remember, he refused to carry weapons on him as the Security chief), who has an unwavering attitude of rejecting a vast array of temptations offered to himself, a character that developped more than friendly relationships with the ""solids"" and who holds one's responsibility and accountability - including his own - in the highest regard ... to do what he did at the end of this episode, not to mention THE WAY in which he did it. More specifically, I'm not talking about siding with a Founder once in a while (because that's understandable, after all, they belong to the same race), I'm talking about doing that irresponsibly and without caring for the repercussions of his actions. It's like having an episode where Odo looks away and doesn't bother to investigate and find the murderer of another individual that happened under his watch ... because he just doesn't give a f.... about it. Especially when the same (dumb) writers emphasized his responsibility and professionalism with every occasion throughout the series.Lastly, Odo doing such things after just two ""sessions""/meetings with another character is absurd, considering he had at least two of such encounters in the past with the said character and was clearly unfazed at this level before.Bottom line, the writers (again) chose to suit the story after the desired result instead of modelating the result based on the story. Apparently, for such amateur writers, it's the effect that determines the cause, and not the cause that leads to a certain effect. And, of course, the whole plot is not only overly simplistic and ridiculous, but utterly not believable. The resolve is insulting the intelligence of the viewers, plain and simple. This could have been done in a million of better, more intelligent and more believeble ways than foolishly playing Odo out of character, really.",2

2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Sacrifice of Angels (TV Episode 1997)",Huge plot holes in this one,"***SPOILER ALERT*** This is probably my third time watching this episode and it really does not get better with subsequent viewings. Here are my issues with it: 1. The Odo storyline. So apparently The Great Link is paradise - which would indicate it's highly addictive - and Odo just walks away from it because of Kira? Kira, that constantly angry, annoying, shrill woman? And after Odo's many betrayals - including having a conversation about the Resistance with the female Changeling in the room, letting Rom get caught, his beliefs becoming almost Nazi-like in his disdain for ""solids"" – he suddenly sees the light and goes right back to how he was? And all is forgiven after he saves Kira in the end? This was just way too easy and contrived. Basically ""let's have Odo dance with the devil for a while and then get him back into the fold quick and easy with no lasting impact"". This is not how real situations unfold. It's lazy.2. As others have mentioned, none of the things that happened in previous episodes to impact the Dominion war effort ever had a noticeable impact. What happened to the limited supply of White? What about the destruction of the shipyards or the sensor array? It's as if none of it mattered to the strength of the Dominion.3. The Battle. I cannot for the life of me understand how the writers think ""good"" space war strategy would be to get a bunch of ships close together in the vastness of space for a huge battle. If I were the Federation, and I were trying to get to DS9, there would seem to be a nearly infinite number of paths for getting there. Why in the world would I group my ""last ditch"" fleet in close proximity to each other where they could easily be destroyed? Why wouldn't you break your ships up into many, many, smaller groupings each with a different path to get to the station? No way with its sensor array out the Dominion would be able to stop them all from getting there. Setting that aside and accepting the stupid premise that the Federation would group its fleet together in such a way, once they spotted the huge Dominion fleet, why wouldn't they have just gone to warp and gone around it? Again, they could have sent different groupings on different routes. At a minimum, the faster ships would have reached DS9 before the Dominion. Why would you risk all at that point to try to ""break through"" this grouping of ships that's an infinitely small cluster in the vastness of space? This makes absolutely no sense. Maybe if they had said there was a HUGE nebula between the Federation fleet and DS9 and there was a hole in the nebula that was the quickest way to DS9 and the Dominion fleet was waiting there to ambush...that *might* make sense. But by all indications, this was the middle of nowhere and they just decided a confrontation with a superior force was a great idea.And whatever happened to ""hey captain, there's this giant Dominion Fleet on our sensors. It's about 8 hours out. I just thought I'd let you know."" Seems like the writers forgot about long range sensors. The Dominion fleet can't cloak. Should have been fairly easy to pick up such a massive number of ships! Instead, we get this clever dialogue:O'BRIEN: I'm picking something up. It's a large Dominion fleet bearing zero zero four mark zero zero nine.Instead of Sisko saying ""how close is it?"" or ""can we go around it"" or ""hey O'Brien what the hell have you been doing for the last few hours that you missed a MASSIVE fleet"", he just charges into battle when his ONLY goal at this point is to get to DS9 and stop the OTHER massive Dominion fleet from coming through the wormhole. At least come up with some plot contrivance that FORCES Sisko to fight this fight. There's nothing.And why didn't the Klingon's hail Sisko and let him know they were on their way? You think that might have affected his strategy at all? Or maybe the Klingons should have just headed to DS9 since the Dominion fleet was busy with Sisko? See how many holes there are in the plot logic here? Also, if the favored strategy of space warfare in the day is to create these massive fleets of ships that travel right next to each other for some reason, why not develop long-range weapons that you can fire over light years? You know, maybe equip photon or quantum torpedoes with warp engines and bombard these huge fleets from light years out? Or launch devices from way out that could irradiate a large area? Kind of like old-fashioned shelling or chemical warfare? Why would you fight the fight that they want you to? I know, this wouldn't look very fun on TV, and HUGE SPACE BATTLES ROCK!!!, but this is SCIENCE fiction, right? So shouldn't we use logic?",4
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Sacrifice of Angels (TV Episode 1997)","Great episode, but we need to talk about the elephant in the wormhole","Action-wise, this is certainly one of the best episodes of DS9.

6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Sacrifice of Angels (TV Episode 1997)","Much better than other episodes, but plot holes remain","Finally, we have a major space battle on the show, and it was great, after dozens of filler episodes that didn't tell much. This is the main reason for my positive rating - I would have wished for more episodes like this in the series, but I guess that budgetary constraints made it difficult to achieve.That being said, this could have been even better if not for the plot holes. Other reviewers (e.g. ericdreynolds) identified some of these, but what bothered me the most were:
the Odo switch to ""the good guys"" made as little sense as his switch to the ""bad guys"" in the first place. As a side note, ""good/bad guys"" is just an expression, because apart from not being genocidal like the Dominion, I don't think the Federation are the good guys by any means, after all, it was them who invaded the Gamma Quadrant, started to colonize it, and provoked the war by refusing to retreat to the Alpha Quadrant when asked nicely by the Dominion earlier in the show - something that seems to be forgotten entirely afterwards, in favor of the Dominion expansionist policy explanation for the conflict. Going back to the Odo storyline, someone called the writers lazy for making his behavior not believable, out of character and basically stupid in these later episodes, but I would use stronger words for such inept writing. It made no sense that after just two links with the female Changeling he would foolishly be so easily manipulated to side with the occupation force in 'Behind the Lines' (not even people in love fall that easily and change their behavior AND principles), and it equally made no sense that when the tides were turning on DS9, Odo would ""miraculously"" recover from the effects of the link by suddenly realizing that billions of people (Kira included) are eventually going to die in the hands of the Dominion in this war...after supposedly being blind to the matter beforehand - go figure.a ridiculous plot hole that wasn't mentioned in the other reviews was Sisko's resolve in the matter of the Dominion reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant. This might be because it's not that easy to spot, but if you pay attention, you'll notice it. I don't know how to say this without spoiling minor bits in the episode, but I'll try to be vague enough to not make the resolve obvious. First, one of Sisko's officers asks him if he has a plan B if stopping the destruction of the minefield the conventional way fails. It appears that he has, only to discover later that this plan involves ... facing thousands of ships on his own (and this is confirmed by his attitude and reactions when dealing with the ""Prophets"" - this is where paying attention is important when watching). This ""plan B"" is not only stupid, but not worthy of a Starfleet cadet, let alone a ""captain"" and the admiral's right hand - even if we're talking about the Defiant. On the other hand, had his plan been to involve the prophets in the first place, that would have been reasonable. The problem (and the plot hole) lies in the fact that his conversations in the episode make it clear that this was NOT his plan...but instead he just wanted to be a kamikaze against thousands of Jem'Hadar ships, without ANY potential gain (and certain loss) for his side whatsoever.Other than that, for the N-th time in Star Trek (not just DS9), the ""Birds of Prey"" save the day - it even rhymes, if you know what I mean. That's not a problem in itself, but this cliche is overused every time the going gets tough in a Star Trek space battle. It apparently became something of a ""magic trick"" to solve hopeless combat situations in the series.",8

As part of the wedding preparations Worf has the equivalent of a four-day stag night with his male friends or at least that is what they think! Dax must show General Martok's wife Sirella that she is worthy to join their house. Sirella is not keen on having a non-Klingon join their house so is determined to make sure she fails the tests although Dax knows something about her family that she would rather keep secret.

It looks as if Dax has blown things when she throws a wild party in Quark's bar where she comes to blows with Sirella when she calls Dax a Rizian slut tries to drag her off to another ritual. Worf tells her to apologise but she refuses leading to him cancelling the wedding; it is up to their friends to get them to change their minds again and get married.After several action packed episodes this one featured far less action but was still a lot of fun; Shannon Cochran put in a good performance as Sirella.

Those who regularly watch the series know it must involve the alternates because Bareil died a year or more ago in the series. Instead of this other Bareil being a holy man, however, this one is a thief and he is on a mission to do bad things. There are several HUGE problems with all this. First, although Major Kira knows of the parallel world and has visited, she almost instantly trusts the evil Bareil! Second, at the very end, the evil guy behaves in a way that isn't one bit consistent with his character.

Jack is hyperactive, Lauren is flirtatious, Patrick is overly nervous and Sarina won't say a word.

With their suggestion ignored they decide to approach the Dominion themselves with information that should minimise casualties at the cost of a certain defeat for the Federation.While there was nothing wrong with Tim Ransom's acting the character of Jack was rather annoying initially, as he just wouldn't stop talking, I suspect this was by design however.

They are loud, obnoxious and 100% annoying. You just want them to shut up and die- -they are THAT annoying! Overall, I cannot believe that this could have been a lot better than it was--it couldn't really have been much worse.",3

Does he recruit Klingons? Does he recruit Nausicaan mercenaries? No, he recruits an unlikely group of Ferengis including Rom, Nog, Ex-liquidator Brunt, his cousin Gaila the arms dealer and Leck who isn't interested in money but likes a challenge especially if he gets to kill somebody. After practicing in the holosuite it is clear that they can't beat the Jem'Hadar in combat; they'll just have to do things the Ferengi way; arrange a deal. The arrange to swap captured Vorta Keevan and head to Empok Nor to make the trade. When the Jem'Hadar arrive there are rather more of them than the Ferengis can deal with they certainly have to hope the Dominion will stick to the arranged deal. It looks like they will until Rom lets slip that the reward the Negus offered for return of his beloved Ishka was more than twice what Quark had told them. Unimpressed Gaila tries to shoot Quark but kills the Vorta by mistake. They must come up with something quickly if they are to get out of there alive! As with most Ferengi led episodes this was more humorous than the average episode. It was amusing watching them run around hopelessly, especially when they thought their prisoner had escaped. I thought Christopher Shea was great as Keevan the deadpan Vorta. The solution they came up with after he was killed was hilarious, although I won't spoil it here.",9
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Magnificent Ferengi (TV Episode 1998)",The not-so-Magnificent Six,"Throughout the run of ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"", the Ferengi were used intermittently as comic relief. In other words, after a few cerebral or galaxy-changing shows, they often tossed in a funny Ferengi one. Now that I am re-watching the series, I have really come to appreciate these Ferengi episodes.The title of this show is a variation on the movie title ""The Magnificent Six"" and the idea is strongly inspired by movies like this. It seems that somehow Moogie (Quark and Rom's mother) has been taken prisoner by the Dominion. Why? Who knows. Regardless, the guys are so upset about this that they've decided to mount a rescue mission--something that seems completely ridiculous since the Jem'Hadar are the universe's best fighters and the Ferengi...well...aren't. Can a team of six Ferengi misfits have a chance at all to not only save Moogie but their sorry butts?This one is about what you'd expect from such a show. It's not the least bit serious and has a few nice laughs--particularly at the end. Overall, like most of the Ferengi shows, it's fun and enjoyable throughout.",9

Sisko is wounded but Dukat saves his life and gets him to a shuttle and down to a nearby planet. It appears that Dukat has told Sisko some untruths about their situation when we see him talking to Weyoun however it soon becomes clear that Weyoun is just an hallucination. Weyoun isn't the only person he sees Damar also appears to him and encourages him to kill Sisko. While the two of them talk the crew of DS9 search for them although their time is limited as they must leave the search to escort a troop transport very soon.While not an action packed episode it was interesting to see Sisko and Dukat interact as their situations are reversed; Marc Alaimo and Avery Brooks put in good performances in what was effectively a two-hander, Marc Alaimo was especially good as he got more and more insane and eventually ended up raving like a mad man. It was a nice touch when just as we think they have been found it turns out the Defiant has just found two other survivors on a different planet. Of course by the end Sisko was rescued but it was a nice surprise that Dukat escaped; he is too good a villain to remain in captivity.",7

Dukat is suffering a kind of nervous breakdown after the death of his daughter and the loss of DS9. What starts out with what appears a kind of compassionate, though reserved reconciliation, turns into Dukat's effort to use his advantage over Sisko (who has a severely damaged arm and other injuries from their crash). We realize quickly that they could be saved, but Dukat envisions a slow death for his adversary. As the story moves along, we see that Dukat has no compassion or empathy for the people he slaughtered--only disdain and fury. His daughter's death is really rather meaningless to him. I thought this was a pretty good episode.",8
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Waltz (TV Episode 1998)",A Duet for The Sisko,"In S1E19, Major Kira captures who she thinks is ""The Butcher or Gallitepp."" In that episode of which this one is a bookend of sorts, She confronts who she thinks is a Cardassian War Criminal, but in reality was Amin Marritza, a lowly file clerk who thought of himself as nothing but a coward, but who in reality was a brave man.The Sisko is on The new Nebula-Class ship ""Honshu"" (Another ship of the same name was destroyed at Wolf 353 in ST:TNG ""The Best of Both Worlds Part II)-Transporting Gul Dukat to his War Crimes Arraignment Hearing. And so The Sisko needs to confront Dukat, giving Dukat every opportunity of grace he can be allowed.Dukat is a complicated Cardassian, he is true Cardassian to the Core, but there is always something just not quite right about him. For a time, he was The Sisko's ally, at one point in the series, we even start believing that he has changed, and he is becoming a good man, especially with the recovery of his Half-Bajoran/Half-Cardassian daughter Ziyal, who was such a special person, she actually influenced Dukat, we hoped, even to become a good man.But with the Loss of Ziyal at the hands of Damar, every ounce of goodness was stripped from Dukat. In a way, I do not blame him, we never realize just how much he treasured Ziyal until she was killed, and he went mad.While The Sisko visits with him in the Brig of the Honshu, Dukat generates an outward air of stability. But anybody who has been through crushing circumstances like that, knows that he is just putting on a Front for The Sisko-He is still damaged, still needs a lot of treatment, still blames everyone except himself for the death of Ziyal.But the Honshu is attacked by a swarm of Cardassian fighters, and is blown to bits. The Sisko wakes up underground on some God/Prophetforsaken planet, his arm in a metal cast, with Dukat, who initially seems to be helpful: Dukat is tending Sisko's wounds, appears to have even set up a rescue transmitter so they can be saved.But little by Little, it is revealed that Dukat is a greatly disturbed individual. He is seeing images of Weyoun, Damar and Kira-Who are egging him on to do bad things. The way I take this is that since Dukat no longer has these real people:Weyoun/Damar/KiraTo blame for his problems, he must needs create them in his mind so he can keep blaming them, and not himself.But ultimately, what he really wants some kind of respect from The Sisko: Who at this time is not about to give him one ounce of it. Let's go over the facts:1) While pretending to be The Sisko and The Federation's Ally, he's out making secret treaties with The Dominion for Cardassia, if only to be made Supreme Leader of that planet.2) Number one is enough.Before he did that thing, we were ready to accept that Dukat had seen sense: He had let the Goodness of Ziyal influence him to walk away from his past, where he was the overseer of Terok Nor: Grabbing Bajoran Women for his own (Ziyal was the product of such a thing), working Bajorans to Death, etc.All of the Cards about Dukat are shown here: In the name of ""trying to help the Bajoran People"" he secretly was trying to eliminate them. He wanted nothing less than the slaughter of their entire race!This elevates Dukat to the level, not of someone who ""has a few dark areas in themselves"" but to someone that clearly defines the absolute line between what is GOOD and what is utterly EVIL.From this point on, we can no longer think, ""Well, Dukat, he's just crazy because Damar killed Ziyal"" or ""He's a little Odd, but give him the chance and he'll do the right thing"" - Wrong! Given the chance, he betrayed The Sisko and The Federation AND Ziyal.The odd thing, or maybe it is the normal thing with people like this: They still think they are doing GOOD. So, Dukat tried to Kill The Sisko on The Planet- And he could have left him there without one further word or thought. But instead, he contacts The Defiant and tells them where they can find The Sisko.This is not the last we see of Dukat, because as intrigued as he is with all things Bajor, he happens to find out all about the Kosst Amojan. But that is a story told in Season 7, mostly.",10

Dukat is always a great addition to any episode and is one of my favorite characters due to his complexity and backstory. Making him go crazy and turn pure evil simplifies his character a bit too much for me and makes him a one dimensional villain. You could argue that his madness drove him to insanity, but this episode makes it clear that at his core he is just a purely evil man and sets the stage for a good vs evil campaign. This seems a bit boring in my view, but as the show closed out it makes sense to close arcs. A shame as Gil Dukat must be one of the best characters on the show and the actor really has presence during his scenes.",7

Soon, however, the ship is attacked and Sisko awakens to find himself in a cave with Dukat. It seems that they managed to somehow escape and are hiding on a very inhospitable planet. Sisko is injured and dependent on his 'host'. This is bad enough since Dukat is a mass-murderer and war criminal. However, it becomes clear that there's much more to it--Dukat has lost his mind and is seeing and hearing people that simply aren't there. It also eventually becomes clear that unless Sisko escapes that Dukat might kill him, as he's obviously impaired and really, really flaky. The biggest problem with this one is that too much time is spend with this pair. They talk, talk, talk and after a while it really drags down the episode.

This is all very amusing till it is learn that he was killed in an ion storm. As the crew mourn his death they share anecdotes about all the fun times they had with him and the great stories he told. When the will is opened Quark is happy to hear that it has all been left to him; sadly all he appears to have left were debts, rotting cargo and a large bath full of mud. The last item does have something of interest in it though; a naked woman who claims to be Morns ex-wife who just happens to know he'd won big on a lottery. Unfortunately she doesn't know where the thousand bricks of gold-pressed latinum is located. As Quark tries to find it it becomes clear that the ex-wife isn't the only person after it; a couple of brothers claim that Morn was in debt to them to the tune of one thousand bricks and finally a 'security officer' who claims that Morn was in fact a prince and the money must be returned to the royal family. Of course none of them has been telling the truth; they stole the money along with Morn ten years previously then he kept it all.This episode got off to a great start, is has long been a joke of the series that Morn is a jovial character despite the fact that we never hear him say a word. Bridget White was fun and rather sexy as the 'ex-wife' Larell who even when she wasn't naked in a mud bath didn't wear too much. Gregory Itzin was also good as the 'security officer retrieving the royal family's money'. With everybody lying about their claim on the money is was impossible to tell which if any of them was telling the truth keeping the episode interesting right to the end. It was a relief to find that Morn wasn't quite as dead as we thought and nice to see Quark get some reward for once.",9

In this case, it's specifically about Quark and his friend, Morn. When the show begins, you learn that the ever-present Morn has died. The reaction of the folks around the station is quite funny and how everyone talks about him is a great contrast to what you've always seen on the show--a large, hulking and ever-quiet alien. Here, however, you learn a lot more about the guy...after he's died.One of the odd things about Morn is that he decided to leave his estate to Quark. At first Quark is thrilled--but soon he learns that Morn has left nothing...or next to nothing. I bit later, however, the show becomes a lot like an old film noir piece, as various scum begin showing up and demand a portion of Morn's vast treasure--100 bars of latinum. But where is this latium? And, are these folks ready to kill Quark to get it? What gives?!This is a cute episode--especially the ending.

1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Far Beyond the Stars (TV Episode 1998)",Golden Age Science Fiction in the Trek Universe,"In the early 60's a pilot for a TV series made history: I'm referring to the ""The Cage"" written by Gene Roddenberry and produced in Theatrical Style which went ""far beyond the distant"" bean-counter's head's at NBC.That could have been the end of Trek right at that point, but something unprecedented occurred: NBC ordered a second pilot and Trek was born.That first Pilot, just like this Deep Space Nine episode: Was born from the ashes of all of the best Science Fiction books and movies of the 50's - Including Forbidden Planet, and the look of the costumes and props in The Cage - Even the photographic special effects, are an Homage to that great era of Science Fiction.The Sisko is meeting with his father (Brock Peter's) when he starts seeing guys in 50's suits and ties and Fedora hats walking about the station - not to be confused with Fringe ""Observers"".His reality starts to splinter and suddenly he finds himself in 50's NYC, he is a colored writer of Science Fiction and the rest of most of the Ops crew plus Quark are his Co-Workers: Writer's, Editors, and Artists (JG Hertzger/Martok is a great Kelly Freas type character). Each person is a character which represents the kind of person they are: O'Brien becomes an Analogue of Issac Asimov and his Robot stories (As Obrien is the main ""Tinkerer and Putterer"" of DS9), The Major represents one of several women writers from that time who had to hide the fact that they were women (and probably a nod to D.C. Fontana, one of the Trek TOS Writers). But the best thing to see was Quark - Probably representing Harlan Ellison (who is also short), when arguing with the Editor (who is Odo aka ""Security""), threatens to quit and clears off his desk and the first item he grabs is his Hugo Award, a small trophy shaped roughly like a V-2 Rocket.Benny Russel as The Sisko is called, writes the story of Deep Space Nine: We can assume he had written ""The Emissary"" - And Odo-Editor rejects his story, because back in that time, issues of race could not be ignored even in fantasy and science fiction. But Quark/Ellison - And this is something Harlan would do - Suggested making it a dream. So Odo-Editor agrees to publish the story ""as a dream of a colored man"", and The Sisko/Benny Russel says that ""It's better than writing it in chalk on the sidewalk""Kasidy is a woman who runs a Diner, who is much like Captain Yates herself. Someone who loves an extraordinary man and hopes for some kind of normal existence, which will be denied to her. Worf makes some pretty funny appearances as a Baseball Player, who is tolerated barely by his team, and Jake Sisko is a young hustler - And the best line of the whole Trek 'Verse is said by him, when he uses the forbidden N-Word - Right on Syndicated Television, and if this had been a Network show, that word would not have been able to be used. And of course, the best: Dukat and Weyoun are filthy corrupt detectives.What is great about this episode is that it shows, how real DS9 actually is - As the creation of the writers and producers of the show - But it EXISTS- Deep Space Nine exists not only in Benny Russel's mind but in ours as well, not to mention the cast and crew of the show.Which is more real, the dreamer or the dream? The thing to remember that for the dreamer, the dream IS reality - During the dream. And so I will forever see DS9 as a kind of window into a possible future. Because anything that we can think of that could happen - DOES happen. This is the basis of Quantum Physics.",10
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Far Beyond the Stars (TV Episode 1998)",Plain and simple: One of the best Sci-Fi episodes out there,"Simple and quick. I love the episode and everything in it. Anyone who doesn't like it I truly believe were just offset by the subject matter. Unlike previous Trek episodes, were racism is dealt with a soft touch. Were racism is bad, we've evolved, we don't do it anymore; Avery Brooks dealt with the topic intellectually and creatively. And I truly believe had they pulled a ""Quantum Leap"" and had Patrick Stewart in the roll of Benny, perceived by everyone around him as a black man, it would have been far more popular and may have won the Emmy it deserved. Not because Mr. Stewart is a better actor but because it would have delivered the message with a softer touch to a questionably receptive audience. I am by no means saying you are a racist because you didn't like, but I have learned the topic of race automatically puts some people on the defensive, on many sides of the issue, and they become less receptive to discussion and debate.If you go in angry, complaining about how this is just another race baiting episode written by the stereotypical black man or liberal Hollywood, you probably will not enjoy it.

3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Far Beyond the Stars (TV Episode 1998)",Visionary episode for a visionless society!!!,"Along with the other differences about this episode (set on Earth in 1953; actors portrayed without alien make-up; etc.), this episode is very visionary! Sadly, it showed a vision for a society (ours, at the moment) that doesn't fully embrace that vision (acceptance and respect for peoples of all races and creeds). I think Sisko's comments at the end of the episode (to his dad, Joseph Sisko) sum it up best: Benny (Sisko's alter-ego character from 1953) is the dreamer (as was Gene Roddenberry and those of the Civil Rights Movement), and his vision for that world of total acceptance is the *AS-YET-UNFULFILLED* dream that is the ""reality"" of the Deep Space 9 universe of the 24th century! That's the beauty of this episode: a warning that, if we don't get it together, we'll stay stuck in the dark-ages-like society of 1953 (or 2012), rather than progress to the visionary, all-inclusive society that Star Trek advocates!",10
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Far Beyond the Stars (TV Episode 1998)",The dreamer and the dream,"After reports of the loss of another ship captained by a friend it seems as if the stress of the war might finally be getting to Captain Sisko. He starts to see people who aren't there then suddenly blacks out and finds himself in what appears to be 1950s America. Suddenly he is a writer working for a science fiction magazine and his co-workers are the people he knows on Deep Space Nine. This being the fifties attitudes are very different to today; casual racism and sexism that would not be tolerated in this day and age barely raise an eyebrow. When artwork for upcoming stories is given out Sisko is drawn to the picture of a space station; it is clearly DS9. The story he writes is the story of the real people on Deep Space Nine but his editor refuses to publish it saying the idea of having a black space station captain is unbelievable. It looks as though things are going well for him when a colleague comes up with a way to make the story acceptable and the editor agrees to publish it; things go wrong however when he is beaten up by the police who have gunned down a friend of his who was breaking into a car.This is possibly the most political episode of Star Trek, drawing attention to just how recently racism was considered acceptable. It doesn't shy away from using the language of the times either; I didn't expect to hear the word 'Negro' or worse on DS9, this of course added to the impact of the story. It was great to see the cast playing somewhat different roles; Rene Auberjonois who usually plays Odo is the editor who accepts society's bigoted attitudes, Armin Shimerman plays a man with a sense of justice, not quite like Quark and Michael Dorn is a Baseball player, I didn't realise for some time that he was Worf... and till I checked here I didn't realise that the two cops were 'Weyoun' and 'Dukat'.",10
5,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Far Beyond the Stars (TV Episode 1998)",Boldly going,"Having watched the Original Series, the Next Generation, all the movies, four seasons of Voyager (God help me) and six of Deep Space Nine, this episode is by far one of the boldest and most daring Star Trek episode I've ever seen.Despite it being in the sixth season it, like some other episodes, has little to do with the Dominion War. Instead, Ben Sisko begins to have some flashbacks and hallucinations, culminating in him showing up in 1950s America, as a science fiction writer.And everyone's there! Aron Eisenberg, who plays Nog, plays a newspaper vendor here, out of makeup. Virtually all the main cast members appear as 'characters' and completely out of makeup. For some, like Armin Shimerman and Rene Auberjonois, they seem entirely unidentifiable, if not for the slight gestures, manners of speech, and general behavior and chemistry that they retain from the actual show as Quark and Odo.It's great fun to see an illustrator walk in to the writer's office drawling as he shows off his drawings for the sci-fi magazine, and realize by his voice that he's General Martok, or that the the way that sleazy officer tilts his head and stiffens his neck utterly gives him away as Gul Dukat.Despite that, the episode does not rely on this gimmick to stay idly by as filler. If anything, the episode's message could appear outdated to some, as it deals with issues of race and discrimination of a level not experienced outside the deep south since the 60s, yet such a message can still be relevant, and comes across powerfully in the hands of writers such as these.Unlike the path taken by ""Voyager"" and ""Enterprise"" and even some episodes of TNG, this one is bold and daring, stepping outside the mold of monotony that is offered by the likes of ""Voyager"". Ben Sisko is Benny Russell, a sci-fi writer who, upon viewing a drawing by Roy Ritterhouse (General Martok) of a space station (DS9), begins formulating a deeply engrossing science fiction story epic that everyone loves...And yet Douglas Pabst (Odo) can't publish it because the main character is black. A ""Negro"", and the episode does not censor itself in using the term Negro or Colored. In an especially bold decision, they even use the N-word, with Jimmy (Jake Sisko) just telling it like it is to Benny; publishers will never accept him or his story, because to them, he's just a n***er.There's great chemistry between everyone, with loads of opportunities for everyone to chew scenery with great relish (Michael Dorn blazes with tremendous ham as Willie Hawkins, a black baseball player), and the story is very deeply thought out, with these 1950s versions of DS9's cast having just enough personality traits to mirror their Trek counterparts, occasional paranoid slips, such as when Benny Russell briefly sees Kay Eaton as Major Kira, or the Preacher (Joseph Sisko) preaching about the Prophets, and touching Benny's ear like the Bajorans do.In the end, the decision is made to publish the story, with the compromise that it all turns out to be a dream of a common, lower-class black man. Yet despite this, the entire magazine issue is ""pulped"" by the owner, and Benny is fired, culminating in a glorious monologue that wonderfully shows off Avery Brooks' acting abilities, and a subsequent breakdown or panic attack that has Russell carted off in an ambulance......and return to Deep Space Nine as Benjamin Sisko.The ending adds a nice tease, with Sisko wondering if indeed his entire life and Deep Space Nine is just a dream, and that he really is Benny Russell. No real purpose to it, nor does it go anywhere, but it's always a neat addition.",10
6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Far Beyond the Stars (TV Episode 1998)","Funny - I didn't hear YHWH's name being used in vain, not once.","I was looking through these reviews, agreeing with a lot of them, even ones that didn't like this episode as much as I or others did. Not really intending to write one of my own, until I came across this gem of a review:""This was my favorite episode until someone used the name of Christ in vain.""Now, that is amazing, because this person heard something that doesn't exist. The ""Benny Russell"" Character who is depicted as the one writing the Deep Space Nine story, says ""God"" one or two times, and he says ""Damn"" twice, but never together, not twice, not even once. Basically he states: ""Calm never got me a damn thing"" and then a few minutes later, he says ""God"" as he collapses on the floor.Sorry, if you are going to complain about profanity, or cursing, then pick a show and an episode that actually has profanity and cursing in it. Also, do you realize that this show ended in 1999? So if you want to complain to the Makers of Deep Space Nine, well, you are 16 years way too late. The company does not even exist anymore, Paramount sold the Franchise to CBS, but they are making the new Trek movies now and no Series are being made at this moment. Finally, you really need to get the correct definition of taking the Lords Name in Vain, which does not actually include ""Jesus,"" it only includes the Hebrew Name of God, ""YWHW"" sometimes pronounced ""Jehovah,"" so nobody on this planet can ever really do any serious sinning by using Christ's name in Vain. The commandment about using ""The Lord's Name"" in Vain is part of the Ten Commandments, and can only apply to using the name YWHW in some nefarious way-Sorry, ""YHWH"" does not equate to ""Jesus"" in any way, shape or form. So your religious complaint about this episode is not even close to valid, it is extremely IN-valid.But it is funny that this person should bring up Religion, as Religion really is part of the DS9 story. Only, it focuses on the religion of the planet Bajor. The writers of DS9 and this episode in general, created a religion for another planet, that has its own ""Prophets,"" and ""Vedeks"" and ""Kais"" - Some of them even as hypocritical as religious followers on this planet. As the show got toward the end of it's seven year run, the connection of Sisko to the ""Prophets"" becomes more pronounced and tangible.In this episode, Sisko is having another ""Orb Shadow,"" similar to an earlier episode where he had found a lost city. But this new experience brings up the question, is Sisko's reality simply the Dream of a suppressed African American Writer of Pulp Science Fiction in the 1950s? Whose work is verboten simply because he writes a story about a Space Station Captain - Who is not ""white."" And because Benny Russell will not obey the social strictures of the 50's, he is punished for it.A few of the other reviewers could not get a handle on the context of this episode. It's like this, what if the whole Deep Space Nine story existed only in Benny Russell's mind? Mainly, this episode gives us a good image of how that would look, from the future to the past. The period parts of this episode were done with much care and love.That is the word there, Love. The word ""Love"" is important, not just to The fictional Bajoran religion, but to our religions. Without Love, you are a loud noisy Cymbal, as it states in 1st Corinthians 13 - And this is NOT a compliment. This show represented Love. Seven Years of Love, by the Actors, by the Writers, by the Production Crew, it was a Labor of Love. Because of this, I really don't see how ANY part of this show can be considered ""Sinful"" or ""Evil"", but I do consider bogus religious complaints sinful and evil. There was no valid reason to write a whole review about a non-existing religious infraction, and I must say, it offended ME, as it should offend anyone unlucky enough to read it.I invite that person to edit their review to remove this false complaint.",10

If you cannot somehow understand the irony of juxtaposition Sisko is in and relish the angst he must deal with then there is no hope you'll be a Star Trek fan at all.""Far Beyond the Stars"" breaks the fourth wall of Deep Space Nine and shows each of the Star trek characters without their heavy makeup and appliances, ""Image in the Sand"" requires we join Bennie Russell in his insanity and root for him to complete the storyline. It is a first for Star Trek and something that everyone needs to be questioned about in their own lives. Just how willing are we to overcome our limits and go beyond convention.There is noting better within the whole Star Trek universe than this ""pair of episodes"" But the first of them Far Beyond the Stars is the better of the two for breaking that fourth wall and showing the actors ""au natural.""",10
8,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Far Beyond the Stars (TV Episode 1998)","A Great Series, In Its Strong Stride, Riffs Joyously","I'm always a fan of those episodes in a great series, where the writers and producers push the envelop and see what new turf they can stand on in their creative mission. This episode of DS9 delivers with a huge punch.Sisko's reality shifts, and he's not on a 24th century space station, he's in a mid 50's publishing house in New York City, in the days immediately before affirmative action and the marches of Dr King, trying to break barriers and make his mark creating and selling the story of his other life. The story is an effective visit to that earlier era, and an effective reminder that there are equal amounts of progress and stagnation in race relations in the US today. We should question ourselves and our society, that's the message I took away.Creatively, it's not far off the path of the series either. In the very first episode, Sisko is set apart from humanity as the Bajoran emissary by Kai Opaca's anointment. And by this time in Season Six, we know that Sisko is subject to random extra-spatial visits by the wormhole entities and the enemy wraiths. In fact, Sisko's own mother is portrayed as a possible wraith. We know he can be submerged in virtual visions outside of his reality.This is among my very favorite DS9 episodes. In ""The Sopranos,"" Tony is immersed in a very different reality while his body is in a coma due to Uncle Junior's paranoid panic shot with a handgun; the premise of ""The Last Temptation Of Christ"" depends on Christ having an alternate-reality pause to experience what his life could otherwise have been as he's being crucified; in DS9 we always feel that the Prophets are somehow guiding and molding Sisko in many subtle ways, and here this certainly fits the story.There's a recurring conversation game of naming your favorite Star Trek Captain, and since I'm an original TOS fan who watched the show on NBC Prime Time i'm always torn. Nobody replaces Shatner for that era, and the whole TOS prime time experience exists in my memory in its own pristine bubble. Of the later captains, I must say Avery Brooks is my favorite.I'm always a little sad to read screeds from those who don't care for Brooks' acting style, or compare him to Patrick Stewart and find him somehow lacking. I never see that. Stewart has his flaws, truth be told, and in this series, the totality of Brooks' work is a thing of beauty.But at the end of the day, both of them are NO John De Lancie. Q!!!!",10
9,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Far Beyond the Stars (TV Episode 1998)","""Star Trek"" At Its Best","I have been re-watching DS9 on Netflix recently, and came to this episode. In a series, and season, full of excellent episodes that all seem to top the preceding, this one outstrips them all. ""Far Beyond the Stars"" not only showcases the intelligence and talent of the writers and cast, but does what ""Star Trek"" does best: provide us with a neutral ground from which to view our own faults and the ethical questions that face us in our modern world. The issue of race, bigotry, and prejudice of all varieties has been addressed often on Star Trek, from the Original Series on, but never with such brutal honesty. From the sets and costumes, to the acting and writing, this episode gives us an uncomfortable view of a recent past that still has validity and truth in the current day. If anyone should say that the treatment of women and people of color depicted in this episode are a thing of the past, note that author J.K.Rowling had to (as the female writer in the episode did) write under a pen-name for fear that the ""Harry Potter"" series would not have been successful if the readers knew the author was female. Or, look at the intense hatred for President Obama under the not-so-opaque veil of his seeming ""foreign,"" ""un-American,"" or just somehow, well, you know. Even the slow death-by-institutional denial suffered by the Benny character is certainly anyone in the Americanized world with a dream or a cause can recognize.I applaud the brave use of the ugly language that, even in the large and diverse Northern American city where I live, can still be heard on a daily basis. Sometimes the truth is unpleasant, disheartening, and just plain cruel, but that is all the more reason we should face it so that we might know it and do something to change it. This is the sort of thing Star Trek has always excelled at, and why this episode represents the best of that tradition.Artistically, by calling attention to the illusion of the Star Trek universe, this episode makes its point sharper and gives its wound more sting. The truth is that our world is much closer to Benny's than that of the color-blind and enlightened Federation. Cirroc Lofton's portrayal of a young man without hope was inspired. And Avery Brook's breakdown reminded me of nothing less than Sidney Poitier's performance in ""Raisin in the Sun."" And in that poem, by Langston Hughes, to which the title of that play/film refers, we come full-circle to the episode's theme of the dream and the dreamer: ""What happens to a dream deferred?""",10
10,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Far Beyond the Stars (TV Episode 1998)",It does not get better than this,"Having watched literally every episode/movie of Star Trek in its 50+ years, including all of the garbage, this is without doubt the best of the best.in my opinion this is the best episode of Star Trek they have ever written, acted and produced. The ability to deal with not just the USA, but the world's ongoing xenophobia, and absolute racism across all cultures has been a main stay of this ""universe"". Avery Brooks rendition of ""Benny"" a 50's black writer who is absolutely discriminated against, is one of the best performances by any Star Trek actor.Of course this is just my opinion, but I feel his performance holds a candle to William Shatner in Star Trek II, Patrick Stewart in Chain of Command (specifically Part II), Christopher Plumber in Star Trek VI, and of course Ricardo Montalban also in Star Trek II.",10
11,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Far Beyond the Stars (TV Episode 1998)","The other ""Rambo"" of Star Trek","I once read a review of the ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" episode ""The Hunted"" (Season 3, episode 11) that compared it to Rambo. It was about a psychologically damaged veteran who is caught by the Enterprise while escaping from a prison planet. He later escapes from the Enterprise brig, then runs, hides, and fights against its crew. He's like Rambo in the forest. In a very different way, this episode is like ""First Blood"" too. It involves a character who struggles to overcome the threat of his oppressors, but instead of fighting for his life with weapons, he is fighting for his career with words. Like the countless time travel episodes seen in many Star Trek series, this one has some fun with the characters and conventions of its show, placing them in unusual roles and environments. It re-imagines the crew of Deep Space Nine as writers for a pulp science fiction magazine. The costumes and production design of the city are impeccable and the main cast clearly has fun playing characters very different from their usual roles. It's a pleasure to watch Bashir and O'Brien trying to pull off American accents, Dax talking like a stereotypical airhead secretary, and Michael Dorn (who plays the almost always deadly serious Worf) as a dashing, Sidney Poitier-type ladies' man ballplayer. The idea that DS9 was invented by a socially progressive-thinking writer during a racist period in American history is a nice nod to Gene Roddenberry's vision of a future in which earth's 20th century problems like racism are nonexistent. Seeing this vision realized and the cast so enjoyably deviating from their regular personalities is very cool. My favorite moment was a very funny visual gag of Michael Dorn speaking in his cheerful ballplayer voice while '50s Sisko (called Benny) sees him as Worf for a split second.Some of the episode's biggest flaws are how melodramatic it is at times, and the cliché villainy of the mean white cops (played by alien baddies Weyoun and Dukat) who terrorize Benny. The episode's worst offense, however, is its climax, which is what reminds me of Rambo (in a bad way) more than anything. Those who have seen the first Rambo movie will recall that it ends with Rambo giving a passionate speech about how badly the war has traumatized him. It's a good idea for a scene, but it's ruined by bad acting from Stallone (who was so great and natural in ""Rocky"") as he weeps his way through unintelligible dialog. Stallone reduces what should be a poignant and powerful scene into a painful farce of a dramatic climax. There is a similar scene in ""Far Beyond the Stars"". It comes towards the end when Benny has a nervous breakdown in his magazine's office. He is told once and for all that he cannot tell the story he wants to tell, and it crushes him emotionally. With all of his heart and soul, he insists that the characters he invented for his story are real and no one can take that away from him, no matter how much society tries to suppress his freedom of expression. This is a lovely and inspirational message, robbed of any power it may have had by how poorly Avery Brooks delivers it. In this scene, he exposes just how limited he is as an actor. There is a theatricality in the cadence and enunciation of his speaking that evokes Patrick Stewart's work as Captain Picard, but where he fails to measure up to Stewart is in trying to play that theatricality for serious effect. When Stewart uses his booming, authoritative voice to give weight and gravity to the seriousness of a situation and his feelings towards it, you believe him. You can take him seriously. With Brooks here, that is not the case. He just looks like he's trying too hard. I respect his attempt, but unfortunately the dramatic notes he's trying to hit are simply beyond his range as an actor. The cast and crew of the show thought this performance was worthy of awards, but I think they were giving it way too much credit. Much like Adam West and William Shatner, Brooks is an actor who tends to speak with a very odd rhythm, which makes it difficult for him to be convincing in serious scenes sometimes. This is evident in the final scene, when he delivers a monologue that is very unnaturally paced and rife with awkward dramatic pauses and breaths. Ultimately, it comes across as laughably stilted as Shatner at his hammiest. The words are supposed to give the episode resonance, but the way they're spoken just ends things on a corny and forced note.With its heavy-handed moralizing, one-dimensional villains, and the disastrous acting in its climax, ""Far Beyond the Stars"" is a very flawed episode. Nonetheless, it manages to be fitfully absorbing because of its surface charms. There's a lot of appeal in the novelty of beautiful period detail and the crew overacting wonderfully as old time-y characters (and out of alien make-up!).If, like me, you have fairly high standards and expectations when it comes to acting, you may find the episode very frustrating and the climatic nervous breakdown scene a little hard to watch without cringing. I don't completely hate the episode, but I'm disappointed because it could have been so much more. I was supposed to feel sorry for the main character because of how cheated he was by his society's racism. Instead, I felt sorry for him because of how badly he'd been let down by the performance of the actor playing him.",6

It went from a hateful past to a hopeful future. Great Story telling.",10
13,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Far Beyond the Stars (TV Episode 1998)",brilliant episode and classic Star Trek,"A brilliant story and classic Star Trek episode. I won't discuss the plot in detail, since that has been done well by other reviewers. Instead I want to focus on one aspect of the story that bothered me when I watched the episode. I wonder whether others had a similar experience.At one point in the story, Ben is told they will publish his DS9 story or series... as long as he makes the DS9 captain a white guy. Ben objects and refuses. This had to be an interesting choice for the episode writers (and for the writer character in the story). If Ben thinks race is irrelevant and racism is foolish, why would he rather have his entire story and series never published over this supposedly irrelevant change? These questions can be answered in at least two ways.One way of thinking about racism is basically ""individualism"", where the ""content of each individuals character"" is what is important, not race. Another way of thinking about racism is basically ""collectivism"", where race is that race is important, and everyone should identify with others of his own race.I was a bit surprised to see the writers of this episode have Ben more concerned with the race of one of the characters in his story than getting his story and series published, getting recognition and building his career (eventually to the point nobody cared about his race because they loved his work so much). This made it seem Ben was more concerned with racism than science-fiction and his story and series. But everything else in the episode had led me to believe he was totally taken by his story, and only secondarily concerned with racism (partly because his work-mates treated him honorably). I think the ""bad treatment Ben suffers in the outside world"" versus the ""essentially fair and friendly treatment Ben enjoys from his coworkers"" would have struck a reasonably good balance.After thinking about this for awhile, I realized the decision they made may have been the better choice if the episode was released to audiences in the 1950s or 1960s (or possibly 1970s). But it didn't feel right seeing this choice in 1998 or on subsequent review in 2012.This is a subtle observation, and I DO NOT ding the episode at all just because I would have made a different choice. Clearly making the change I suggest would have required many other changes in the story.This was a great, classic episode in the finest Star Trek tradition.",10
14,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Far Beyond the Stars (TV Episode 1998)",The crux of Star Trek,"Far Beyond the Stars is neither the most original, nor the most well-written episode. Indeed, the reason for yet another ""prophets' vision"" episode is again arbitrary and the mid-20th century story fairly simple: the cast are sci-fi writers in the 1950s, working for a struggling magazine.Yet, the episode is the epitomy of all that is good with Star Trek. Passing a message of ""racism is bad"" was simple enough. But unlike other times, when Star Trek touched such issues softly (often by merely portraying a world where inequality doesn't exist or seen as the trait of a less advanced race), here it actually drives the point home with a certain brutality: there was no happy ending for people like the hero of this story. And not just because of a racist system, personalised in the police, but just as much due to the inaction of others: the publisher who likes Benny's story but refuses it anyway, the other black people who are resigned to their fate, etc.
It is important to remember this was America only a few years before the original Star Trek appeared. Where the presence of Uhura and Spock (among others) made the exact same point that this episode's hero attempted.At the same time, by choosing a 50s pulp magazine as its setting, and with numerous references to the era's booming sci-fi scene, it is also a fitting tribute to all the culture that created modern Science Fiction, and a reminder that it was exactly this field that was instrumental in getting visibility to issues of discrimination: for instance, the trouble Benny has in publishing his story has many parallels with Theodore Sturgeon's The World Well Lost.FInally, it is fun to, for once, see so many of the characters without prosthetics.",9
15,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Far Beyond the Stars (TV Episode 1998)",Outstanding from Beginning to End,"I was floored by this episode. For Sisko to go back in time and play a character with such integrity and grit, showing his chops, is wonderful. Of course, the real attraction is to see virtually the entire crew in 1950's street clothes. The one I couldn't get over was the guy who plays Quark. The characters in the magazine office maintained their personalities, even though they were not on a space station. Plus, the ugly portrayals of racism are so real. I loved the use of the normal bad guys as power hungry police. It all worked so admirably.",10
16,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Far Beyond the Stars (TV Episode 1998)","Like the TV show ""Unplugged"" and ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" fused together.","Years ago, there was a show on MTV which featured musicians playing their music without all the fancy stuff. Missing were the amps, synthesizers and the like. It was stripped down to the basics and groups like KISS appeared without makeup. So why am I mentioning all this when it comes to an episode of ""Star Trek: Deep Space""? Well, in a way, this is like a fusion of the two show, as the cast regulars are seen in this one--but without their makeup! So, if you ever wanted to see Quark, Dukat and others as they really looked back in the 1990s, here's your chance. For this reason alone, it's worth seeing the show.In the beginning of the episode, reality and fiction start to blur for Captain Sisko. One minute he'e on the station and in the next, he's back in the 1950s on Earth! Soon, he's entirely back in the 1950s and living another person's life--a life where all his friends, colleagues and enemies are played by various members of the crew and enemies of the station. In the story, Sisko is a guy who writes sci-fi tales and his stories about Captain Sisko and the space station are coming out of his mind one after the other and he keeps writing them down. It's all a very interesting homage to sci- fi in the grand old pulp days and ultimately turns out to be brought on by the Prophets. This is one you'll either love or hate. I liked seeing everyone without the makeup but the 50s story soon lost me and it really felt like padding. Okay to watch but no more.",6
17,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Far Beyond the Stars (TV Episode 1998)",Is this the best Star Trek episode? Let's find out!,"Nowadays TV series are on the same level as movies (Game of Thrones being the obvious example) in terms of production, writing, smoothness, acting and directing. Older series suffered from being viewed as a step down from movies. But every now and then, a show would get it right, and Star Trek, far too often ignored for catering to a very specific fan base, had some of the greatest TV episodes of all. And this one is a perfect example.* Plot (SPOILERS)Sisko begins to hallucinate a life as a sci fi writer named Benny Russell in a US era abundant in space interest and racism. As he struggles against prejudice, he creates DS9 stories, and begins to wonder whether he is the writer or the character. Scenes on DS9 feature Sisko wondering the exact same thing. As he faces serious opposition from the prevailing racism of his time, he stubbornly refuses to budge, and stands by his creation.* Good stuffBoy where do I begin? Let me say that the best episodes of any series is often the one where they leave their comfort zone the most and enjoy themselves the most. Here we see DS9 in make-up-less reinvented roles and all seem to rejoice. The era could not have been brought to life any better and this 1950s New York seems at times almost palpable. Seeing Odo, Worf, Nog, Quark, Weyoun, Martok and Dukat as human characters is great fun. The story is mesmerizing in daring and originality. Jake and Papa Sisko both have memorable roles. It contains 2 of the best lines in all of television (""To them you will always be a N....."" and ""You are the dreamer...and the dream""). The workplace for Incredible Tales seems like a place I want to work. The whole episode vibes with so much soul and liveliness you'll get sucked in before you can say Qapla'. Note the music which underscores every single mood and mood shift. The Quark- Odo rivalry is a joy as ever. There is a underlying notion that elevates the episode. Not only is it about the power of fiction and ideas, but you genuinely start to wonder which world is real. There are two fantastic shots that mirror each other, Russell seeing Sisko in a reflection and Sisko seeing Russell in a reflection. The way this 40 minutes of your time well spend juggles Star Trek's dealing with racism and the vague line between fantasy and reality makes this an instant, all-out classic.* Things I dislikedErm...I guess I'm not overly fond of Dax in this one. Her ""Ewww she's got a worm in her belly!"" is pretty cringe-worthy. It would have been nice to see Rom. Sisko has been described as a Shakespearian android, in the way that he sometimes, usually when angry, delivers his lines in a broken, over the top way but I disagree. I find his final rant and subsequent collapse completely believable and a tour de force. People object to the N-word but it was used back then by the black community as it is today. People object to the religious overtones but he IS the Emmissary of the Prophets and in this episode a Creator of Words and Worlds.* Conclusion: How good is it?Star Trek has given us 7 contenders for best Star Trek and even Best TV episodes of all time. Harlan Ellison boggles the mind with ""City on the Edge of Forever"". ""Measure of a Man"" brings up, debates, and settles the question of robotic and AI rights light years ahead of its time. ""The Best of Both Worlds"" has THE best cliffhanger and shows how good TNG can be when the writers go off the beaten path. ""The Inner Light"" begins with a clever idea and sees Patrick Stewart singlehandedly elevate all of TNG to new levels in a performance I scale higher than any movie performance that year. ""Duet"" also deals with racism but in a great clash of foes and minds. ""Waltz"" allows 2 arch nemeses to duke it out, mentally, verbally and physically all in the light of the deteriorating mind of Dukat, which means that Sisko is in greater danger every time he gets the upper hand.And then there is this episode. Bold, original, creative, daring. It deals with reality, racism, and passion. The directing and acting is stellar. The dialogue and monologue is out of this wold. The feel of this episode is undeniably the best in Star Trek. But is it the best overall? No. I would still choose The Inner Light and Waltz as better episodes but is deserves third place in the election. Far Beyond the Stars is DS9, Brooks, Trek, the writers, producers and directors at its absolute best and it will forever be one of my favorite episodes of any TV show. It should be mandatory viewing for kids and film students, both for its sense of oldness as well as bringing back to live an era in the past. This is a real world episode in the sci fi series most viewed as a Western setting, and it hits all the right notes. Mind-shattering. 10/10",10

I don't know about this as a problem because this episode addresses 1940's America. You would imagine that since the time period already happened and your not addressing an issue in 2330's something deep space, societal issues actually present would take prevalence in the episode. I think it was well done and I think it was daring. I Like to see Star Trek address more issues that actually touch the real current mankind and not just the idealized mankind.All and all I think character allusion across the time periods was better than 99% of other television shows if not necessarily Star Trek and I do think even for Star Trek because of the central theme there seemed to be a bleeding through from the actual actor to the character they where playing. Cirroc Lofton's character was a little bit of a ""Johnny throws dice"" archetype but I don't know if it was necessarily the writing or the way that the character plays out.All and all I thought is was in the top 10% of the series episodes.

This is because the success of this mission ends up relying on a miniaturized ship and its miniaturized crew.The show begins near some anomaly (that's Star Trek for 'great big something we cannot really describe') and to investigate it, they decide to miniaturize a runabout and its crew. However, in the midst of this, a Jem'Hadar ship appears and attacks. Before long, the Defiant has been captured and the crew appears to be screwed. Their only chance is to somehow sabotage the ship or, perhaps, the tiny ship can slip in an offer assistance.This is a rather cool episode. Of course it's sill, but it is sci- fi! What I really liked was the funny ending involving Odo--but that's something you'll just need to see for yourself.",8

With the Defiant under Jem'Hadar control it will be up to the tiny shuttle and its crew to help disable the bridge controls so that Captain Sisko can retake the ship.This was a fun episode; it was amusing watching Dr Bashir winding up the Chief about them being reduced in size and the shuttle craft was surprisingly cute as it buzzed around engineering shooting at the Jem'Hadar. This episode also introduced a division within the Jem'Hadar that was previously not known about; those created in the Alpha Quadrant clearly believe that they are superior to those created in the Gamma Quadrant.",8

As he leaves he meets another man and we learn he is involved in an undercover investigation into the Orion Syndicate. Back on DS9 the chief is being missed as only he can keep the station running smoothly. It looks as if the Chief's work is good enough and Bilby trusts him; soon he is being asked to fix faulty Klingon disruptors. Bilby uses one of them to kill the man who sold them to him. Soon the Chief is accompanying Bilby to see his boss Raimus, who is accompanied by a Vorta and a Jem'Hadar; the Orion Syndicate are working for the Dominion. That isn't the Chief's only problem; Bilby has told him that the Syndicate have a member of Star Fleet in their pocket who has given them the names of previous agents. By the time the Chief discovers what the Dominion want Bilby to do he has grown close to him and warns him that the Klingon's are ready for his assassination attempt, by telling Bilby who he is there is a chance Miles will be killed.I rather enjoyed this episode, it was very different to most episodes, and it felt more like a crime story than science fiction. Colm Meany was good as always as the Chief and Nick Tate was good as Bilby, it was interesting to see him getting closer to Bilby even though he was working to get him arrested. The final scene between the two where the Chief tells him who he really is was very touching, especially when he still went on with the attack even though he knew he would be killed.",9

The Bar O'Brien is in is so much like several places I used to sit down in to have tankards of various ales on Geary Street.While three crooks try to get a free meal out of a 24th century ATM machine, O'Brien ""Spikes"" one of the crooks, ""Krole"" (Carlos Carrasco, who was also in ""House of Quark"") who has a computer interface built in to his brain, making electric toast out of his expensive Lo-Jack.And so Miles is slowly accepted into Bilby's band of outlaws. Bilby (Nick Tate) is not your regular crook: He is not an evil man, he is a lot like O'Brien: A family man, and cares for his family, and his cat, Chester.The reversal here, is that Bilby is shown to be a man of high standards and morals, of a sort: But O'Brien's Federation Handler, he is a real piece of work - Right out of the Bourne stories, a real scumbag.""A simple investigation"" gets more complicated when Bilby ""Witnesses"" for O'Brien in front of a man named Raimus (Joseph Culp): Raimus is a true representation of ""Gangster.""Bilby has gotten hold of three Klingon Disruptors, which were broken, no problem for O'Brien to fix. But what in blazes does Bilby's boss Raimus need with these things? The Federation Handler ""Chadwick"" (Michael Harney) keeps O'Brien on the job, to find out, even though O'Brien has already done his part of the bargain.But it is not so Simple for O'Brien, who has taken a liking to Bilby and wants to help him. He gets Chadwick to loosely promise that Bilby will be arrested and put in a ""safe prison."" But Chadwick is just yanking O'Brien's chain by this time.This is one of the stories, where you want to root for the Bad Guys to be able to get away: Until Raimus brings a visitor to Bilby: A Vorta named Gelnon (Leland Crooke)- And the creep wants to assassinate the Klingon Governor of the planet, and make it look like Gowron did it, so that maybe The Klingon Empire will pounce on The Federation like a pack of Targ - Or Ferengi.John Davis Chandler in one of his last Television roles is Flith, Bilby's other henchman. But he has done some ""private business"" behind Bilby's back and had not paid the skim to Bilby. The Vorta had found out about this somehow, and has Raimus assemble his men at The Bar: When The Vorta points out O'Brien, Flith speaks up and is shot by the Bartender in the back, so it's a close call: For Bilby too, as Bilby had never witnessed for Flith.Chadwick sets a Trap for Bilby, where The Klingons will most surely kill him. Miles can't have that, so he tries to get Liam Bilby to abort the assassination and come with him.The True Friendship that was developing between O'Brien and Bilby, is what makes this a great episode: O'Brien is always a man who is Straight-Forward: and like James Cagney, will look you in the eye and tell you the Truth. And so he hates this whole assignment. So he tells Bilby everything, but there is nothing that can be done except for Bilby to do his Job so that Raimus will never know that he knew O'Brien was a spy. He gives Chester, and his family by implication, to O'Briens care.As ""out of place"" this episode is, as inexplicable as O'Brien's presence on that Planet is, none of that needs to be explained. We simply do not need to know about any of that, it is a situation that O'Brien has found himself in, and the limits of his own personal Honor are tested to the extreme. And it is one of Colm Meany's finest moments, especially the interaction between Colm and Nick Tate, two master Character Actors.I loved everything about this episode, it was a highly welcome change from the Dominion War.

This job would require a skilled secret agent who could play the part of a trusted mobster. O'Brien is a shoot from the hip kind of guy and would probably be caught in a lie or slip up in the first five minutes. It's about a friendship that develops with a boss and the consequences of lying to him. Not a bad episode. Just not on a par with some others.",6

However, I agree that ""Honor Among Thieves"" is not a particularly good show.When the show begins, O'Brien is in some other part of the galaxy because he's on an undercover mission. It seems that the dreaded Orion Syndicate has infiltrated Starfleet and because of that they need some outsider. What follows is much like a mobster film, with O'Brien becoming a made man and learning to over-identify too much with his new 'friends'. Why wasn't this a very good episode? Well, while O'Brien is only on this mission a short time, he way over-identifies with his new friends and his reaction to their being arrested or killed (due to their own evil) is ridiculous and makes no sense.

Nick Tate seems to be interested only in getting paid, and even Colm Meaney's performance wasn't what it should have been.

They manage to get through the planetary defences but while walking through the jungle they come across a Jem'Hadar patrol, they defeat them but Jadzia is seriously wounded, she tells Worf to go on without her. He does but doesn't get far before he realises he must return and save her. Once back on DS9 he learns that the Cardassian was killed and that he had information that could potentially have saved millions; was the life of one woman, even if it was his wife, worth that price? Some comedy relief was provided by Chief O'Brien being determined to see Quark be defeated at the Ferengi game of Tongo.This was a good episode was pretty good, for a while I could almost believe that Jadzia might die.

When Jadzia is injured, Worf must choose between her and the mission. He must also choose between any serious future in the Federation and his love for this woman/trill. One thing that has been set up are some absolutes. It gets down to a choice between one and millions. Is this true. Are millions automatically dead due if Worf makes a contrary decision.

The love affair between Worf and Jadzia is explored as they are sent on a mission together. While enroute they discuss their honeymoon plans. There is also a side story about Chief Obrien and Doctor Bashir wanting to beat Quark's winning streak at Tongo. But the Tongo story really gets in the way of what turns into an interesting interplay between the newly married couple. Worf admits to trying to modify his personality to be ""compliant"" to Jadzia's wishes. When the Jem Hadar catch them off guard in the jungle and Jadzia is critically injured, Worf takes it personally. He decides that his attempt to modify his personality was a mistake and he must fall back on his warrior roots to complete the mission. Duty comes first and Worf must leave Jadzia, who is near death, for 44 hours in the jungle to make the rendezvous with an important Federation spy. Ultimately, Worf abandons his duty to the federation (quite surprisingly for Worf) and takes Jadzia to safety instead. The spy is killed along with his knowledge that could have saved millions of lives. For what appeared at first to be another puff piece, this episode really put some depth into the relationship between Worf and Jadzia. A welcome change over the usual Bajoran orb stories...I was impressed.",8
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Change of Heart (TV Episode 1998)",Writers dropped the ball on this one,"This is probably one of the worst episodes of DS9. The reason is a critical plot hole. Now, I know plot holes are quite common and usually too insignificant to notice or be bothered, but this one is so jarring that it made me yell at the screen.What am I talking about? Basically, Jadzia and Worf have to go on a 2-day, 20km trip through a jungle, meet up with someone, and return the way they came. Jadzia gets shot a third of the way through the first trek, with a wound that gets worse if she walks. The patrol that found them is entirely eliminated. That's where the writers demonstrate a complete lack of spatial orientation and/or common sense.What happens in the episode: Worf and the seriously wounded Jadzia continue towards the rendezvous point at a slow pace. Once they're nearly there, Jadzia becomes unable to walk further, so Worf has to continue without her. They exchange goodbyes, making it clear that Jadzia is being left to die. But almost as soon as Worf sets out, he has a change of heart, goes back, and carries Jadzia all the way back to their entry/exit point. The spy they had to extract is executed and information that could save millions is lost.Why it doesn't make sense: This is a 2-way trip! They're going to be pretty much retracing their steps on the way back! So Jadzia could just have stayed where she got shot, minimizing the bleeding, and waited for Worf and the spy to get there on the return trip! Worf would then clearly have no trouble carrying her along the rest of the way back. At most, he would have to, before leaving, carry her a kilometer or so away from where they encountered the patrol, so she isn't found by whoever is sent to search for the missing patrol. And, not being slowed down by a wounded Jadzia, he would still make it to the rendezvous point in time. And thus, both the spy and Jadzia get to live.But the writers, in their desire to shake things up by having the hero not get both the girl and the mission done for once, failed to notice that all the tension and drama relies on an obvious plot hole. Quite disappointing.The rest of the episode - the Tongo plot line and Worf & Jadzia's married life interactions, is pretty good. But the episode overall leaves a bad taste due to the script stupidity described above.",3
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Change of Heart (TV Episode 1998)",Now that's what I call a true connection between Worf and Jadzia,"I already said in one of my reviews on a previous episode that the romance between Worf and Jadzia Dax is pathetic, for the simple reason that the characters didn't seem to connect in a proper and believable way until this point in the series. This episode however was something else, and in a good way: we finally see a proof of their true love when Jadzia risks her life to be up to Worf standards and Worf risks his career to try and save Jadzia from a certain death. Because, make no mistake, it wasn't just Worf who risked something in this episode, but Jadzia as well.This leads me to the plot hole identified by another reviewer, that Worf should have let Jadzia right where she got injured, complete the mission on his own and pick her up on his return (since the path they were supposed to take was the same on their return). I agree that this is indeed a plot hole, but furtunately, unlike other episodes where the characters made absurd (read stupid) choices that couldn't be explained in another way than by the inept writing, this time there were mitigating circumstances for the characters' behavior: Jadzia, as I mentioned before, wanted to show Worf that she's up to the task and a worthy Klingon wife (risking her life in the process), and Worf couldn't let her in the vicinity of the killed enemies since she would have been easy to find and capture when the rest of the enemy troops searched for the missing personnel. So, at least this time, there were at least two (more or less) logical explanations to the actions of the characters - it's wasn't just stuff thrown out of the blue by the writers in order to come up with a certain resolve in the episode (like so many times before in the series).Apart from that, it really was a touching example of true love between two characters that didn't seem really connected before in the series (I'm mainly talking about acting, not just about events like their wedding). I don't know about you, but I liked this episode - the first time I was convinced that what they had was love and not just a one night stand between ""the beauty and the beast""...",10
5,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Change of Heart (TV Episode 1998)",What Constitutes a Plot Hole,"This isn't the greatest episode of the series. But I feel a lot of the criticism of it is unfair. Previous reviews have pointed out possible ways that Worf could have saved Jadzia and accomplished his mission. But he chose not to. This isn't a plot hole. It's a choice. Worf makes a decision. Just because it isn't the best or most logical choice doesn't make it a failure on the part of the writers. The entire point of the episode is to show how Worf has grown and changed because of his love for Jadzia. For the first time in his life there is something that matters to him more than a duty. This isn't a video game. The point isn't to solve a puzzle. It's a story about a man who has spent his whole life denying his own desires in favor of his duty. And he finally finds someone he loves enough to break him out of that pattern. Who wants to see a story about someone doing what they've always done, and will do again?",7
6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Change of Heart (TV Episode 1998)",Not horrible....,"This is an episode considered by at least one reviewer to be among the worst of the series. I didn't love it but that seems a bit harsh. The show has the usual two plots. The main one involves Worf and Jadzia Dax. They are en route to their honeymoon when they receive a distress call from a Cardassian spy--and they have to race there to try to rescue the guy before his own people kill him. Naturally, the mission does NOT work like clockwork and soon Jadzia is shot and might not survive. So what is Worf to do? The other plot is very lightweight--even more so than usual. It seems that Quark has become unbeatable at Tongo. Even Jadzia has lost to him. So, for some inexplicable reason, O'Brien is determined to see Quark fall.Neither plot is all that interesting. The one involving Worf is a bit interesting, though I was surprised by his actions. As for the other, it was underdeveloped and not particularly interesting.",5

There are so many questions that tear this apart, beginning with the results of Narys's actions that were witnessed by Dukat. Why doesn't he remember them in the present. Why does he spitefully attack her memories when he has so much to do with the current war? If you think for a moment it all unravels.",5
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Wrongs Darker Than Death or Night (TV Episode 1998)",The Broad Grey Line,"This episode clearly represents those shades of Grey that are hard to define when a person who has basic ""Black and White standards"" is confronted with the very things they have stood against and even despised when they see it in other people.For Kira Nerys, it had always been simple: A person who accommodated The Cardassians during the Occupation of Bajor, were ""collaborators"" or Quislings. A person who resisted the Cardassian Occupation was ""In the Resistance"" - Perhaps the French citizens of Occupied France, during World War Two had the same thoughts, and they were as wrong as Nerys had been.The problem is that some information came to Nerys in the form of a communique from Dukat. Information about the fate of her mother, who Nerys had always thought had been killed as a member of The Resistance.In fact, her mother was not killed while in a labor camp- She had been tapped by Cardassians to be a ""Comfort Woman"" for Cardassian Soldiers in the ""New"" Space Station orbiting Bajor: What was called then, Terok Nor, but we know it as Deep Space Nine- And in fact became Gul Dukat's personal Comfort Woman/Lover for the next seven years.Kira is angry - And takes it out on her co-workers, including Doctor Bashir. And it takes one Odo to get her to deal with it instead of taking it out on everyone else.And so we get to see the proper use of the Bajoran ""Orb of Time"" - The Prophets must be consulted and it is they who will determine if they will transport Nerys back in time so she can see first hand- The Prophets agree it is a worthy quest and they send her to the Labour Camp where she was as a child. We have to account for the Orb's first appearance in ""Trials and Tribbleations"" - And conclude that it was the will of the Prophets for that to occur as well. Thomas Kopache reprises his role as Kira Taban (with more hair) and Leslie Hope is Kira Meru, her mother.And so Nerys becomes face to face with her younger self - Becoming a part of her own past history. And of course, both Nerys and Meru are tapped as Comfort Women, they are transported to Terok Nor and immediately, Dukat moves in on Meru, who moves her into his quarters with no time wasted. The Legate who Nerys was with mimed Dukat's whole act perfectly, so while Nerys saw Dukat's deception Meru did not. Nerys had the luxury of actually knowing Dukat - Meru did not. And so as a mother making the only decision she could to benefit her starving children, she agrees to live with Dukat - And Nerys can't face this, she storms out and decides to live with the slave Bajorans who work in the ore processing plant.The Music of this episode is drastically different than the generic strains which usually play out in Next Generation and Deep Space Nine - There is a haunting melody that plays as Nerys walks among the Ghosts of her Past. which puts an accent on this episode and makes it a pivotal piece of the Deep Space Nine Mythos.Because Nerys has marked her Mother as a Collaborator and potential Collateral Damage as she plots to kill Dukat. So she plants a bomb given to her by the leader of a resistance cell disguised as a part of her Earring Ornament into Dukat's Quarters. Nerys was clear in this purpose as she decides to do it, but at the last minute she sees Meru reacting to a Message Crystal from Taban - And that in fact the reason why Nerys survived starvation as a child was directly due to Meru's involvement with Dukat.Nerys performs an 11th-Hour rescue of Meru and Dukat as the bomb goes off - And she finds herself back in front of The Orb of Time.This episode clearly speaks to anybody who has defined ideas of absolute wrong or right - Or good or evil. There is simply no such thing as absolute wrong or absolute right - And Meru's actions had saved Nerys' Life. These are the rules of the Universe, who are we to argue with The Prophets - Or God?",10

I found it interesting how the directors and writers were able to show more of the Occupation. I had always thought that they did not really show what the Occupation was like. Sure, the characters of DS9 (especially the Bajorans) talked about it sometimes, but they didn't show it.I once heard that the writers were originally planning to do a Kira Nerys/Dukat love episode (something about a past affair between them I believe?). However, Nana Visitor (the actress who played Kira Nerys) protested against it, saying it was against Kira's character. So, the writers used Kira Nerys's mother (Kira Meru) instead.Bad idea. The whole Kira Meru/Dukat love story messed the time line up big time. And the writers must have been really desperate for an ending, because the ending wasn't very good (I found it to be very unbelievable).However, I give this episode an 8/10 because I really liked how they showed more of the Occupation of Bajor.",8

While I don't see any such comments yet for this one, I feel that it is the third episode in a row that disappoints. Among the worst? Who knows...but clearly the three shows left me flat.This show is unusual in that it only has one plot--not the usual two. When the show begins, Dukat makes a snarky call to Kira on the birthday of her dead mother. He makes it sound as if he and Kira Meru were lovers--and she was very, very willing. Kira can't live without knowing the truth so she buzzes down to Bajor to play with the orb that tells the future. It takes her on a trip back in time to when her mother was taken from the family and made a 'comfort woman' for Dukat. There are a couple problems with this one. The biggest is that it is a 'who cares?' episode, as it has no real impact on the series nor does it advance any plot. It's just about giving Major Kira a sense of peace of mind. Yeah, whatever. The other problem is that the Major's behaviors throughout the show are very inconsistent and confusing to say the least. Not a bad show--just far from the usual high quality I'd come to expect.",5

She and her mother are soon selected by a Bajoran collaborator to provide 'comfort' to the Cardassians stationed on DS9, or Terok Nor as it was then called. Her mother is soon selected by Gul Dukat but at first Kira can't believe she is with him willingly, soon however she realises her mother is indeed a collaborator. She agrees to help the resistance carry out an attack that will kill Dul Dukat and her mother but at the last minute she can't let her mother die.This was an good episode which made Major Kira question her beliefs, about her mother, Gul Dukat and those who collaborated. Dukat comes across as manipulative as we would expect but he was true to his word when he said he would look after Kira's mother's family; so in a way Kira owes her life to him. We also got look at an earlier period of the occupation than I think we've seen before, it was interesting to see just how many Bajorans happily collaborated with the occupying forces.",8

So, it's nice to see that here with ""Inquisition"" that the show is back on track.The show begins with Dr. Bashir getting ready to leave the station to go to some medical conference. However, just as he's about to leave a team of Federation investigators arrive. They think that there's a traitor on board and everyone is confined to quarters until their investigation is complete. What follows is a super- paranoid episode--one that reveals for the first time that there might be a shadow organization within the Federation like the Obsidian Order within the Cardassians. I like paranoid episodes and so I have a natural affinity for shows like this one. I also appreciate it when the shows reveal a less than warm and fuzzy presence within the Federation--mostly because for so long the Trek universe had been a bit too nice. These folks ain't nice--and it's a nice way to see the show returning to form. Well worth seeing.",8
0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" In the Pale Moonlight (TV Episode 1998)",Maybe DS9's finest.,"Folks either hate this episode or love it. Honestly, I think it's of the best of the series, along with ""Duet"", ""The Visitor"", and ""The Way of the Warrior"".To make a long story short, Sisko may have to sacrifice everything to save the Federation (and the Alpha Quadrant) from certain annihilation at the hands of the Dominion.Andrew Robinson and Avery Brooks have tremendous chemistry in this episode, and it challenges everything that made Star Trek what is was. Make no mistake, few series can get away with it, let alone accomplish something like this. The direction and script were fantastic in this episode, also producing a new canon ship and giving one the best one liners in Star Trek history.This episode may not have the touching emotions of ""The Visitor"" or the dynamic action of ""Way of the Warrior"", but it is gritty, dirty, and makes you question what you would be willing to sacrifice to save something larger then yourself.",10
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" In the Pale Moonlight (TV Episode 1998)",The apex of the antithesis,"This episode stands out as the single best episode of any startreck series. The reason that it stands out it not for its being the 'perfect trek episode', but rather one that stands out for its seriousness, drama, and real thought. More importantly, it is an episode that goes against the grain of trek morality.For many, this episode may be a rather banal conversational episode, completely devoid of any explosions or monsters. It also may be criticized as the abandonment of Gene Roddenbury's vision for this society. Well, that's true. This is a very atypical trek story.But the way it is different is what makes it not only so unique, but also so powerful. Sisko must abandon his morality to succeed... and succeed he does. In most of the rest of star trek, the morality of the Federation is its most prominent trait. When other characters have abandoned their moral codes, their efforts have usually ended in failure. But not this time.What results from this conflict is the framework of the whole story. It is narrated by a tortured Sisko, trying to work out where he went wrong. Throughout his story, Sisko grapples with the anguish he feels at abandoning the principles of the Federation he wished to protect... but at the end, he says that he can live with his choices.Brook's acting throughout is among the finest in the franchises history. The plot is both complex and engaging. And more importantly... it manages to be gripping without resorting to explosions and monsters.",10
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" In the Pale Moonlight (TV Episode 1998)",Walking the thin line...,"In this episode Captain Sisko must walk the thin line between right and wrong again. But here it is very well done, very well written, acted and directed. Here the stakes are much higher and the moral transgressions less grave than in 'For the Uniform'. And the way it is told, by Sisko wrestling with his conscience about what he has done is brilliant. There is more emphasis here on the moral issues, which make them more obvious to everyone. That is probably why some may think this is not a typical Star Trek episode. But it is precisely because of Sisko's struggle with those issues that makes this one of Star Trek's finest episodes.",10
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" In the Pale Moonlight (TV Episode 1998)",This Is Star Trek For Grownups,"Having grown up with Star Trek as a child I was used to the Gene Roddenberry's vision of humanity having perfected itself. A fine vision indeed and a noble one.But what happens if the Federation goes head to head with an implacable foe. No I am not talking about the Borg although they are scary enough. How would they be able to fight an enemy that can shape shift and infiltrate entire worlds?Deep Space Nine gives you the answer and it is not necessarily a pretty one either. The Dominion are probably among the best Star Trek villains ever devised and the are really put to good use here. Rick Berman and Ira Steven Behr are pretty much responsible for the direction that Deep Space None took. It is much darker in tone than either of it's predecessors and the stories were a lot deeper in nature.In The Pale Moonlight was probably the darkest and definitely the best.It starts out with Captain Sisko reciting into his personal log about previous events that worry him. After posting yet another Friday casualty list he decides to try and bring the Romulans who have taken a neutral stance into the war.After speaking to Garak the Cardassian tailor and spy, they devise a plan that will work. The plan includes obtaining a Cardassian data rod, someone to forge false information onto it and tricking a Romulan Senator into believing it's real.But thing become messy indeed resulting in, aiding a criminal, bribing Guark, obtaining bio metric gel for unknown and quite probably illegal purposes and the assassination of a Romulan senator and the murder of the forger.A small price to pay as Garak points out and in the end, through all his misgivings and doubt, Sisko is forced to agree. A small price to pay indeed.The plan ultimately works and even though Sisko has had to do some morally ambiguous things, as he says, knowing that it would help win the war, he could live with it.A perfect episode with the most impressive acting I have ever seen. This was quite possibly Avery Brooks finest moment, his acting was spot on. Andrew Robinson as Garak was as usual superb and Stephen McHattie as Vreenak was excellent. Victor Lobl directing was nothing short of brilliant as he managed to catch the truly desperate air of a Federation fighting and slowly losing to a dangerous enemy and of an honorable man being forced by necessity to do very dishonorable things.In The Pale Moonlight was a standout episode along with Way Of The Warrior, The Visitor, Apocalypse Rising and Nor the Battle to the Strong just to name a few.Deep Space Nine was always known as the Star Trek series that people that didn't like Star Trek watched. Here in Sydney, when it was first coming out on video, there was a waiting list to rent it and it had a huge following and even though the series is finished, there is still remains fans of the show.Sadly though Gene Roddenberry would not have liked this episode simply because it was not in keeping with his vision of a perfect society. But Deep Space Nine shows what happens to that perfect society when put into real peril. It shows people having to sometimes compromise their ideas for the greater good. Yes, this is indeed Star Trek for grownups.",10

Look at the adversaries: The Dominion, the Cardassians, and the Romulans. What integrity do they have when it comes to codes of ethics. They are strictly embedded in conquest. What Sisko admits to in his log is the manipulating of the war, attempting to push the Romulans into battle with their allies. It is a strategy that Sisko finds reprehensible, but he also realizes that without action, he will continue to put name after name on his casualty board. He enlists Garak, who is awesome in this episode as the master manipulator and conniver. Don't miss this episode.",10

I think i'm gonna put up a poster with Gareth what he did for the federation here. I'm still on a high while writing this. What is probably the best part of this is while Sisko is telling the story, he does not give anything away. This is so well written and so well acted by all! Ohh someone please make a new Star Trek series - I so miss the franchise!!! ""So... I lied. I cheated. I bribed men to cover the crimes of other men. I am an accessory to murder.

6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" In the Pale Moonlight (TV Episode 1998)",Every man has his price,"This is probably the best episode of 'Deep Space Nine' and possibly the best episode of any 'Star Trek' series; it doesn't involve spectacular special effects and we aren't in any real fear for the protagonists' safety but we do see a character changing before us in a very believable way. The story is told in flash back as Captain Sisko records a log entry about something that clearly bothers him; we then see just what happened in the preceding two weeks. Fed up with constantly posting casualty reports the captain decides him must do something to persuade the Romulans to join the war on the side of the Federation; to this end he sees Garak and tells him that he will do what ever it takes to get the Romulans to join the war. Garak agrees to help and contacts his acquaintances on Cardassia, they are soon killed however. He has an alternative plan; he will arrange for a fake recording of Dominion plans to attack Romulus to fall into the hands of the Romulans. To do this he will need the help of a man the Klingons plan to execute and another who wants payment in a substance that could be used for several dangerous things. Sisko even has to bribe Quark not to press charges when one of these men attacks him. After all this it looks as if it was in vain when the Romulan senator who is given the rod realises it is a fake; this should be the end of the plan but his shuttle explodes as it leaves Dominion space following a meeting he had there leading to the Romulans entering the war on the side of the Federation as planned.This was a fantastic episode featuring some great acting from Avery Brooks and Andrew Robinson as Sisko and Garak. We knew that Garak was an arch-manipulator who would do what it took to get the job done but it was a shock to see Captain Sisko going against his core principles to compete his task, the fact that he had few regrets about doing it made it all the more shocking.",10
7,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" In the Pale Moonlight (TV Episode 1998)",Captain Sisko's Dark Side.,One of my favourite episodes of DS9 which was the most different and unique of all the Star Trek series. I liked this episode in particular because you get to see a side to Captain Sisko that you don't usually see to an extent. There are many highlights in this episode. Garak who is a wonderful character makes this episode more enjoyable. I like the fact that Sisko gets physical with Garak. The fact that Sisko is willing to sacrifice his starfleet ideals in order to save the Alpha Quadrant. I liked that entire scene and dialogue at the end of the episode where he says he will learn to live with what he is done. Captain Sisko suits the darker tone of DS9.,10
8,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" In the Pale Moonlight (TV Episode 1998)",An episode with teeth...,"manufacture evidence situational ethicsI like the various ""Star Trek"" shows. However, one problem that they occasionally had was being too nice and showing the human race was way too noble--so much so that it seemed very unrealistic. So, because of that, episodes when the humans cheat, connive and behave very human are quite welcome--and it's why I like ""In the Pale Moon Light"" so much.The show begins with Sisko in his quarters. He's wrestling with some moral quandary and he begins talking his problem our loud to his personal log. As a result, we see a series of flashbacks that explain what's happened. It seems that the Captain is getting sick and tired of the war with the Dominion and he sees that unless something happens soon, the tide will forever be against the Federation and Klingon Empire. So, he comes up with an idea...is there any way to bring the Romulans into the conflict? So far, this old enemy is content to sit back and just watch the destruction. So how can they push the Romulans to abrogate their non-aggression treaty with the Dominion? The only possible answer is to convince the Romulans that the Dominion is planning to invade them. But, since there is no real evidence of this, perhaps, with the help of some unsavory friends, they can manufacture the evidence!The show is wonderfully devious. But, what I liked best is the ending and how Sisko plans of dealing with this moral dilemma. Well worth seeing and incredibly different from the old 'let's all be friends' style show we had seen in many previous episodes.",10
9,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" In the Pale Moonlight (TV Episode 1998)",Take it in the eye Star Trek Discovery,"I just saw this episode again, after not having seen it for a number of years, and it shows so well why long time Star Trek fans are disenchanted, (to say the least), with the current showings of the Star trek franchise, (Ahem, Kelvin timeline and Discovery).
Star Trek has always been about exploring the human condition in an idealized future. DS9 was the first show to go to the darker side of that exploration with great success I think. It shows how you can make a darker and grittier Star Trek without losing what makes the franchise great. You watch this episode and then try to compare it to 2 years of Star Trek Discovery and..... and.... well, there are no words, suitable for a decent review, to describe the outcome.
I truly wish there is more writing like what is shown in this episode in the upcoming Star Trek Picard... but I wouldn't hold my breath.",10
10,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" In the Pale Moonlight (TV Episode 1998)","Breaks every screenwriting rule, but still works","Spoilers, obviously.While ITPM has been rightly praised as among the entire franchise's best hours, I've yet to see the screenplay analyzed for what it ISN'T: i.e., textbook Hollywood writing. ITPM breaks two of the most important rules of screenwriting, and not only gets away with these violations, but benefits from them.The first, of course, is voiceover narration. The episode is framed by Sisko's narration (both honest and otherwise) -- an approach which ""normally"" indicates a shortcoming in the action, which should be strong enough to explain itself to the viewer. Yet it's Sisko's unreliable and halting narration that carries us along with him on his journey of moral acquiescence.The second 'violation' is even more glaring: the heavy use of Exposition, also known as ""show, don't tell"". Most if not all of ITPM's standard dramatic action takes place offscreen, with the audience subsequently learning about these events from character dialogue AFTER the fact. Posting casualty lists, battles with the Dominion, the assassination of Garak's operatives on Cardassia, the fall of Betazed, Tolar's murder, Vreenak's shuttle exploding: Typically these scenes would be front and center, trying to wow us with action, violence, and conflict. But no: the drama derives from our characters' REACTIONS to these quadrant-altering events. Think about it: Watching Sisko and Garak argue over the ethics of Vreenak's demise becomes far more riveting than actually watching his shuttle explode. I mean, whoa -- that is brilliant screenwriting.As a huge Garak/Robinson fan, my favorite moment of this episode might be Sisko's first encounter with Tolar. The slippery forger is laying on the baloney super-thick, as one would expect. Then Sisko mentions Garak: ""Garak... is HERE?"" ""Yes."" Suddenly Tolar becomes a meek little mouse, slinking away in fear. Talk about a fearsome reputation! Brrrrrrr....Kudos to the writing staff, especially Ron Moore, for knowing when and how to shatter the rulebook.",10
11,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" In the Pale Moonlight (TV Episode 1998)",addresses a dilemma almost never addressed,"One of the most astronomical failures of honest, ethical, productive, benevolent human beings is... what? It is the fact that they fail to identify human predators as predators, and treat human predators in the way they know they must treat other animal predators... namely avoid them, evade them, escape them, or preferably exterminate them.Though this issue does not explicitly make the important identification that I made above, it is the subtext.To put this another way, any honest, ethical, productive, benevolent being (human or alien) should treat all other honest, ethical, productive, benevolent being (human or alien) consistent with ""natural ethics"". Which in practice means, ""take no actions to harm or destroy them or their property"".The problem with most human beings is... their brain is totally faked out when they face predators who dress in fancy clothes or uniforms... or speak in fancy language. They are especially faked out when the favorite words, terms and ideas of honest, ethical, productive, benevolent beings are thrown back at them in an argument.Sadly, honest, ethical, productive, benevolent human beings don't realize predators WILL DO AND SAY ANYTHING TO GET WHAT THEY WANT... including endless lies, misrepresentations, and totally bogus argumentation that includes what seem to be arguments based upon the values they hold an cherish.And so, honest, ethical, productive, benevolent human beings allow human predators (and in science fiction, also advanced/intelligent alien predators) to run roughshod over them. They restrain their actions against these predators almost exactly as they would restrain their actions against other honest, ethical, productive beings.This gives HUGE advantages to human predators (and advanced alien predators) who do and say anything whatsoever to dominate and destroy any honest, ethical, productive, benevolent being who dare object to their dishonesty, their complete lack of ethics (substituting the modus-operandi ""get away with whatever we can"" for ethics) and predatory actions.Which is why earth is ruled by human predators-that-be who call themselves ""government"" and simply assert that ethics is defined by the premise that ""the predators-that-be are masters, producers are slaves/prey, and what constitutes ethics and ""good behavior"" is... obeying every demand from predators-that-be).One time in a million or billion the consequences of being so utterly, completely, absolutely and obviously STUPID as this is more than an honest, ethical, productive, benevolent human being can stomach.Which is when a basically honest, ethical, productive, benevolent beings takes actions like those Sisco did in this ""best of series"" episode. They've been pushed so far beyond rational behavior by falling prey to the utterly bogus predator-pushed notion that they are dealing with other honorable beings (not with vile, vicious, nefarious, diabolical, destructive predators) that the enormity of the contradiction snaps something in their brain (that needed to be snapped decades before) and convinces them they must take certain actions to actually defend themselves against predators-that-be and predator-classes as they always should have from the beginning.By the end of this episode Sisco still feels wrongly guilty for his actions, but does accept that he had no choice. Essentially the lesson most people take from this episode is ""sometimes in extreme situations the ends justify the means"".But this is the wrong interpretation and conclusion. The correct interpretation and conclusion is... it is ALWAYS wrong and stupid to treat vile, vicious, nefarious, diabolical, destructive predators as if they were fellow honest, ethical, productive, benevolent ""equals"" (of similarly ethical status as them). Once any creature is clearly and confidently identified as being a dangerous predator, no valid ethics places ANY restraints on what can be done to avoid them, evade them, escape them... or preferably, exterminate them. And to exterminate them is far, far, far and away the preferred action, because that saves the slaughter of tens, hundreds, thousands, millions (or in this case billions) of honest, ethical, productive, benevolent beings.Even though the correct identification wasn't made, and even though Sisco wrongly feels guilty, this episode did present the important issue... even if in an oblique and not entirely accurate way. But... better than nothing, because the lesson that needs to be learned by honest, ethical, productive, benevolent human beings (and aliens) was at least presented in an indirect form.",10

Odo decides that he might be able to get some advice on how to let Kira know how he feels about her. On the holosuite Vic tries to help Odo with his confidence, getting him to join his band as the pianist. After his first performance Vic has a couple of chesty holograms complement Odo's playing prowess. He still worries about Kira who is on Bajor with the First Minister. Vic's next idea is to have a new singer perform; one who looks just like the Major. When Kira returns to the station Vic invites her to dine with Odo on the holosuite; the problem is he told Odo that he is going to be having a date with a holographic Kira, it all goes well until he makes it clear that he things she is a hologram leading to a rather awkward situation for both Kira and Odo. Of course in the end the two of them end up together, just as they should have.This episode was a nice break from the war, James Darren is great as the holographic lounge singer, Rene Auberjonois put in a fun performance as Odo, it was nice to see him lighten up a bit and Nana Visitor positively sizzled as she sang 'Fever' while draped across Odo's piano. I'm not usually a fan of holodeck episodes but Vic's character is different as he knows what he is. The ending was great, just what I suspect most fans had been wanting to happen for some time.",8

He is also programmed to be a kind of father confessor who knows how to ""hustle babes."" Odo is surprised by the guy's reaction to him and Kira and when Odo comes to him in private, Vic (Darren) sets about making Odo interesting and appealing.

Having in this episode only might have been okay, but he would make 8 appearances on the show--8 very contrived appearances.When the show begins, Dr. Bashir is showing off his new boy friend, Vic Fontaine, to all his friends. It seems that Bashir adores this new holographic character and wants everyone to see this all-knowing and really clever Las Vegas lounge singer circa 1960. Following this trip to the holosuite, Odo finds he's fascinated by Vic. After all, Vic seems to really know about women and relationships and Odo thinks MAYBE Vic can help him with Major Kira. What follows is much like Vic taking Odo to school--teaching him to have fun, be more assertive and take the initiative. However, to really get Odo moving, Vic decides to trick him and the Major-- something VERY odd for a holo character. What's even odder is that Vic even contacts the two when they aren't in the holosuite! Huh?This episode is kind of fun, though it's also a bit creepy (Vic is a bit invasive and tricky) and it means MORE Vic episodes. I never liked the overuse of the holosuites in the show--and here they really let them run amok.By the way, two reasons to see this show are for Nana Visitor singing ""Fever"" (she was HOT and what a voice!) as well as the 'big kiss'-- it's a doozy.",6

Sure, at first the idea of super-aliens who live in the wormhole and are worshipped on the nearby planet as gods was a decent one. But it quickly derailed into silliness, with Sisko having visions, all too convenient interventions, and of course, prophecies, the shame of any plot that respects itself.So here an old stone contains a prophecy about the Emissary (unsuprisingly, all the rest has little to do with him) and after some whining by Kai Winn, in the end one of the prophets possesses Kira, an evil ghost possesses Jake, and they go all Harry Potter, until Kai Winn interrupts the fight by releasing a mcguffin.The whole affair is bad enough, with the continuous (and failing) effort to show the Bajoran religion and culture as admirable when it is simply (very) annoying being especially disappointing for a franchise which stands directly opposed to such primitiveness.",3

The writing on it says 'Welcome Emissary' and when he touches it he finds himself with the prophets who are talking about something called 'The Reckoning'. He takes the relic back to the station to work on a full translation. When it is translated he has reason to worry, as it appears to prophesy the destruction of Deep Space Nine. People start to worry when the wormhole keeps opening and closing causing the station to shake like an earthquake and natural disasters to occur on Bajor. Kai Winn believes this is because Sisko has angered the Prophets by removing the relic from Bajor. He agrees to its return but after frustration that he doesn't understand what the Prophets are trying to say he breaks it. One of the Prophets possesses Kira and announces that she will battle the 'Kosst Amojan', the evil counterpart of the prophets. The station is evacuated ahead of the battle and there is quite a surprise when we see whom the Kosst Amojan has chosen to possess for the battle: Jake Sisko.It was nice to take a break from the war with the Dominion and return to the Prophets and learn a bit more about Captain Sisko's relationship with them. The extra jeopardy when we see whom the Kosst Amojan had chosen nicely raised the tension and made it look as if the Captain was going to have to make a real sacrifice. It was interesting to see that the person who defied the prophets and saved Jake wasn't Sisko but the Kai. Louise Fletcher put in a fine performance as the unlikeable Kai, it can't be easy playing such a character as she is meant to be self-serving rather than being truly villainous.",9

This one is a bit different and it further illustrates what a giant butt-head Kai Winn is.When the show begins, Sisko is on Bajor when he feels the urge to take an ancient holy relic with him back to DS9. You assume the Prophets planted this urge in him. Not too surprisingly, Kai Winn is unhappy and lodges a formal protest. Imagine, then, her reaction when once again the Prophets tell Sisko to do something...SMASH the relic! What's next (other than Winn blowing a gasket?!)?This episode is a good prelude to the crazy stuff that ends the series a year later.

No doubt this episode was tailored to accommodate the American obsession with religion. It's a wonder that Bajor manages to be a space-faring culture with such backwards mentality. Hear this: to them, it's perfectly logical that a weird space phenomenon (the gate), as well as their planet's meteorology and geology, could be severely upset depending on the particular location of an archaeological artefact. Something funny about Bajor, but also about most other Star Trek ""races"", is the fact that they achieve global unity in such eminently polarising subjects as religion or ideology. Look at human religions, and see how they're prone to split into rival branches, over trivial, petty details, and with such intensity that their members are not above killing people from the other side at the slightest ""provocation"". Religion has never been a unifying force: it's been one of the main dividers within humankind, and a willing originator of death, suffering, intolerance.The fact that this is a work of science fiction does not mean that shoddy plot designs should be acceptable, when they breach the credibility of a universe based on progress.",1

0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Valiant (TV Episode 1998)",The arrogance of youth,When Jake joins Nog ion what should be a routine flight to Ferenginar he doesn't expect that they will run into a squadron of Jem'Hadar fighters. It looks like they are doomed but a Star Fleet ship comes to the rescue; the USS Valiant. The Valiant is identical to the Defiant but its crew is a group of cadets. They were on a training mission when the war with the Dominion began and their regular officers were killed in combat. Star Fleet is unaware that the ship is only crewed by cadets but they are continuing with the mission to discover a secret Dominion ship. The Valiant's captain makes Nog their chief engineer as he has experience with the identical Defiant and knows a few tricks to improve performance. While the cadets act professionally it is clear that the stress of the situation is getting to them; one starts to cry after talking about home with Jake and the captain can't sleep and is secretly taking pills. They manage to find the Dominion battleship but instead of returning to the Federation with the valuable information the captain arrogantly believes they can take it out themselves; a decision that will lead to the loss of the Valiant and most of her crew.When we first came across the ship crewed entirely by cadets I thought we were in for a group of Wesley Crusher types: teenagers excelling in an adult world in situations where adults had difficulties but thankfully they weren't like that. They clearly didn't have the maturity to correctly analyse the situation and most of them ended up dead because of it. This prevented the episode from being cliché and gave it a realistic and exciting conclusion.,8

He probably has some good points about the mission, but he is such a dork no one will listen to him. The whole reporter thing is so poorly presented. He is abundantly lazy and lacking in drive.

Starship Troopers worked because of the heavy satire, but this episode falls on its face and is an endless cringe-fest.Red Squad, who didn't learn from their earlier blind faith in a changeling, are at it again exuding tinges of a hitler-youth group. The ""Red Squad! Red Squad!"" moment after a motivational speech from their stimulant addled captain comes across as a ""U-S-A!

So many things don't make any sense. First off, Starfleet would never have a ship full of cadets during war time. They would have maybe 10 at most. Looks like when they do their obnoxious red squad chant (most obnoxious 10 seconds of television) there's close to 50-60 of them. Only one legit captain and the rest were caddets? Not remotely plausible and down right dangerous. This is proved with the end results. On top of that, every caddet was beyond annoying and grating. Obnoxious. I get that's what they were directed to do, so I blame poor directing mixed with poor acting. It's a terrible episode due to the conclusion they come to. One of the caddets survives and has the gaul to say the captain was a good one and that the crew failed him. Are you out of your mind you brainwashed fool? Your captain killed EVERYONE! Except Jake, Nog and the caddet who lived on the moon (sorry Luna). Then what really made me mad was Nog telling Jake to print the story in a way to let people make up their own minds. Um no. If Jake writes the truth about what happend on that ship, no one is walking away thinking the caddet captain did anything right. It's a mess of an episode that doesn't make you think. It is obvious these inexperienced caddets have no business running a war ship. It is obvious they are all going to die. No twists. No turns. Just idiots doing dumb things because they have no experience. It was glorious watching them blow up. Still love DS9, just a bad episode.",1

(May stand corrected there?). I must admit I never 'loved' the design: it just looks like a flattened transporter to me.The ship has been commandeered by very young 'red guard' star-fleet cadets after the senior officers all died. Haven't seen that happen on a ship before ... even the 'Equinox' crew survived mostly. It is quite a sad episode, but its nice to get off the station and get a glimpse at some new characters and 'normal' star-fleet.The action sequences are very good in this episode too!",8
6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Valiant (TV Episode 1998)",It's a testament to how annoying these cadets were...,"...that I rather hoped a few of them -- especially the ""First Officer"" -- would survive just so they could sit in a Starbase medical ward and contemplate the true depths of their failure and stupidity. I also kinda wanted to see the ""Captain"" live long enough for Sisko took look him straight in the eyes and explain exactly how he felt about the fact that this ""Captain"" threw his son in the brig for expressing an opinion to his friend and almost got him killed for precisely the reasons Jake gave to boot. *Those* scenes would have upped may rating by at least two full stars.In fairness, I will give credit to the show for attempting to give us an intelligent look at how the real world (or galaxy) actually works and how kids and teenagers are often unprepared for the stakes involved. The episode showed some flashes of potential, and there was a solid idea hiding in there somewhere. The fact that the galaxy can be a hard and unforgiving place is often glossed over in other Star Trek series, where everything turns out for the best at the end of an episode, or an episode arc, and there are few permanent repercussions. The idea was there. The execution was serviceable (and not, imo, as terrible as some reviewers seem to think) but not particularly impressive. This episode, to me, represents the germ of the sort of realistic issues of dangerous long-lasting consequences that set DS9 apart from other ST series, but lacked sufficient development to really stick in the mind in the way that, say, By the Pale Moonlight did.",6

However, due to Deep Space Nine's well defined characters, it is still watchable, unlike many other of Star Trek's worst hours.Armin Shimerman puts on a brave face when madeup as a Ferengi female and there are some genuinely funny scenes, such as when he tries to fend off Nilva's (Henry Gibson) advances. Jeffrey Combs is brilliant as always, with his character of Brunt getting what he wants most - power. He has it, but only for a few days. Wallace Shawn is also fantastic as the temporarily deposed Zek.Its interesting to note that the late Michael Piller called this a classic when he read the script. While the finished product isn't, its definitely better than the worst episodes of the other Trek series.",10
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Profit and Lace (TV Episode 1998)","Funny, Light-Hearted Episode","I don't know why people disliked thid episode, I thought it was funny and entertaining. I wouldn't say it was a 10 but the funny moments are mostly with Rom. Watch at least once and you may or may not like it. But everyone is entitled to theit opinions.",7
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Profit and Lace (TV Episode 1998)",Whoever said this was the worst DS9 is absolutely wrong,"This is one of the best Ferengi eps of the whole run. It is precisely because of Alex Siddig's Direction that this Ep is incredibly funny.Some have surmised that because of this ep, no more Ferengi DS9 Eps were ever made. Maybe so, but the Producers of DS9 were wholly wrong.And here is why: All through The Next Generation and DS9, the Ferengi eps were always played too over-the-top. Now the reason why I thought The Next Generation was simply the best TV Show under FRINGE was due to the portrayal of unrealistic ideas in a realistic fashion: Hence we Believed in Warp Drive, Transporters, Photon Torpedoes, Klingons, Borg and Ferengi.The Funniest Ferengi TNG Ep was Menage a Troi: Not because the Ferengi were scuttling around in slapstick fashion, be because it was directed well and acted STRAIGHT. Which made it very funny, especially when Riker tricks the Ferengi into opening the Brig, and the next scene shows Riker rubbing his hand and commenting on how hard Ferengi Jaws are. This was classic comedy - Underplaying a thing, making it funny, where it would not be that amusing if played over the top.As much as I like the earlier Ferengi DS9 Eps, they were all played way too far over the top and the Ferengi were all represented as silly goons, and most importantly, unrealistically portrayed.In this Ep, Siddig takes all the things about Ferengi we chuckle about, and plays it down quite a bit, making it henceforth, believable and realistic.And so, the conflict of the episode becomes more believable, because the Ferengi are not overpronounced caricatures like they had been portrayed as earlier.Especially Grand Nagus Zek - The Great Wallace Shawn subdues his performance, making us accept the Ferengi as a statement of ""Hooman"" traits of which the Ferengi are actually an exaggeration.But because this ep is NOT exaggerated in any way, shape of form, we finally have an Ep of Ferengi where we can FEEL for them in their dilemma.And so I must adamantly refute the idea that this is ""The Worst Ep"" of DS9 - DS9 was a DARK series, some of the comedic and gimmick eps were overplayed, some of them were not. DS9 was a Trek Experiment - This was WW II in Space.My Favourite era of Film is the war years of Hollywood - DS9 represents those years - We had films generally about the War, some of them about great Battles, that we lost (Wake Island) or Won (Sands of Iwo Jima) - And the Jem Hadar represent the Ideal Storm Troopers of Hitler- Men who have no need ot pleasure or recreation, who think about nothing except battle, even more so than Klingons.DS9 was NOT Gene Roddenberry's Trek 'Verse - It was the antithesis of Gene's 'Verse. Ultimately, DS9 was not a Trek show.However, it was Berman creation, and Berman placed 4 of the 7 season run of DS9 in a war zone, just like the US in WW-II.Which is exactly how ""our"" war years began - All of our war years grew out of idyllic years. In 1933, we did not know that a threat to the lives of all free men was beginning to fester in the heart of Germany. The Cardassians are the Nazi's of DS9 - Xenophobic, Isolationist, with an image of their self-worth that they wanted to impose on everybody else.During our war years, we would not have survived if not for the Comedic Films of that era, one of them being Bringing Up Baby.Needless to say, at the time Bringing Up Baby was made, it was rejected by the General Public- But today is accepted as the penultimate example of Comedy.The same way, this very funny, and Superior DS9 Ep was rejected by Trekkers- But in fact, it is simply of of the best DS9 Eps ever made, and the comedy is superior BECAUSE Siddig directed it straight.",10
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Profit and Lace (TV Episode 1998)",Pushing Ferengi humor to nearly the breaking point.,"""Profit and Lace"" is considered by some to be the worst episode of ""Star Trak: Deep Space 9"". While I wouldn't go that far, I would agree that it's sub-par and I can EASILY understand why folks wouldn't like it. It IS dumb. I laughed at some of the dumb and feel it is poor but there are many worse episodes.When this Ferengi episode begins, the Grand Nagus has been removed from office and evil Brunt has taken his place--at least temporarily. This is because his fellow Ferengi assume the Grand Nagus has lost his mind, as he's out cavorting with Quark's moogie-- a woman who wears clothes and earns profit! The ex-Grand Nagus and Moogie soon arrive and are full of bluster, but Quark knows that it will be a very, very difficult fight to get the Grand Nagus' job back at the upcoming election.So far, the show is a bit silly. But it shifts into warp drive silliness when Moogie has a heart attack when Quark is yelling at her. The plan HAD been for Moogie to wow one of the most powerful Ferengi leaders and convince him that there is profit to be made by treating females better. So what will they do? Yep, give Quark a sex change and have him handle the difficult meeting. It's all very embarrassing and I am sure that it must have also been uncomfortable for the actors. Even with the laughs the show provides periodically, the sheer weirdness and ickiness would probably make many viewers blush. Overall, I don't think it was awful but it sure could have been handled better...and without the sex change. Mega- weird, that's for sure!",4
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Profit and Lace (TV Episode 1998)",Possibly the worst episode of DS9.,"I am not a huge fan of any Ferengi heavy episode, especially one with the annoying mother (Moogi) or the grand Nagus (Wallace Shawn). I normally love his acting but he always plays it over the top annoying. The voice is especially bad and the dialog is always horrid. This particular one is incredibly unpleasant to watch. The tone is inconsistent, story is weak and pacing is poor. Watching so many Ferengi act feminine was embarrassingly unpleasant. I have heard a bunch of reasons why it fell flat, particularly the poor directing, but it stands to reason no one involved in the actual production liked working on the episode. The charming and gorgeous Leeta is not enough to pull this stinker up. Its a horrible episode and out of 173 this one could easily be deleted from all records and I don't think too many people would miss it. Even Ferengi lovers would be disappointed this time. I can forgive the actors and producers because this season contains so many excellent episodes, so it doesn't really pull the rest down.",1

They invite Nilva, a member of the Ferengi Trade Commission to come to DS9 and see that a Ferengi female can be just as good at business as a male; unfortunately Ishka, Quark's mother, is in sickbay after collapsing during an argument with Quark. With no other Female Ferengi on the station Quark must dress like a woman and get his manly lobes reduced. It looks as though his dinner with Nilva is going well; until he is invited back to his room for 'dessert'.This was one of the weaker episodes of Deep Space Nine. While the DS9 Ferengi are good characters they can't carry episodes on there own that well, and this is possibly the weakest of their episodes. Seeing Quark in drag was rather funny although it looked as though Armin Shimerman was feeling uncomfortable in the role although that may have been him wanting Quark to look very uncomfortable. There were some good points of course, Chase Masterson is always a joy to watch as Leeta even if her role is fairly small and watching Quark kissing Nilva in front of Brunt was as hilarious as it was shocking.",6

It might have been considered funny at the time but this is absolutely terrible nowadays. The episode trivialises workplace sexual harassment. It starts with Quark threatening to fire a waitress unless she gives him sexual favours.The central story then tries to set a ""progressive"" tone by discussing giving ferengi women basic rights, while playing heavily on gender stereotypes. Quark goes through a male to female sex change procedure, and suddenly becomes in touch with his emotions, more ""sensitive"", and overly concerned about his appearance, the size of his hips, etc. At the end after reverting to a male body, he finds himself still romantically interested in men, presumably due to the lingering effects of his transition to the female sex. The episode writers show obvious ignorance about gender identity and sexual orientation, implying that they are one and the same thing and must therefore always be aligned.The worst part comes with the incredibly unfunny ""joke"" at the end.

The rest of the Ferengi realize that this is really bad new for them because they are obvious adversaries of Brunt. This is especially true of Quark. When a major council member with a lot of clout is asked to come to DS9, they must produce someone who can talk to him as a female. I won't say any more but it is pretty funny.

Ultimately they decide to send her back to her primitive world 300 years previous, alone, with little or no discussion of whether they should all go as a family, or if they could settle on another uninhabited planet s a family. Just send her back to her cavewoman life - end of discussion.All the while, Worf's inferiority complex about being a good father is thrust upon the viewer as a subplot with very little setup or explanation.

Parents, friends, institutions and professionals of today would have done so much more for her.Molly's initial rehabilitation is left almost entirely to her parents with virtually no support from the Federation's vast resources. Bashir does little other than stand by with sedatives when things get out of hand. The Enterprise had a ship's counselor but there doesn't appear to be a single psychologist in residence on the much larger and far more psychologically demanding environment of DS9.They create a holosuite version of older Molly's environment to help her feel secure during the rehab, but she's forced out of it because two Klingons won't give up their reserved time. Sisko could have demanded the facility be appropriated to deal with this emergency. Worf has been called upon to convince other Klingons to make more challenging accommodations than give up a recreational holosuite reservation. And when Molly responds to the trauma of being forcibly removed from her comfort environment, the response is to put her in jail.Molly's parents don't fight for her care. They decide to throw her back to her life of isolation and deprivation AND destroy the time portal so she can never be recovered. Wow! With all the resources of the Federation this is the best they could come up with? Jail, institutionalization or disposal.Star Trek offers an optimistic vision for many aspects of the human future.

So, after tons of ""Star Trek"", ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" and ""Star Trek: Voyager"" they've finally hit this huge milestone. Unfortunately, while a very good episode, it wasn't as resounding a success as the show a few seasons back created to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the series (""Trials and Tribble-ations"", 5.6).The show's main plot involves a long distance distress call. A ship's captain, Lisa Cusak, has begun sending distress calls to anyone who might respond. It seems that something odd about the atmosphere of some planet caused her ship to crash and the Defiant is many days away from rescuing her. There is a problem, however, because the crash site is a class L planet--with a thin atmosphere that necessitate Cusak using all her available oxygen...and then perhaps some. So, it's a race to the planet and the crew of the Defiant take time to talk with Cusak and keep her spirits high.The other plot is ill-defined. For some reason that makes zero sense, Jake and Quark are working together on some smuggling. This plot DID end well, but otherwise is far inferior to the Cusak one in every way.So is it any good? Yup. But for a 500th episode I guess I just expected more. Still, it is worth seeing.",7

This would have allowed her to ""attend"" her own wake once everyone was outside the energy barrier, which could have been a truly moving scene rather than the ""learning experiences"" that we got.And it was out of character for Odo to let goods be smuggled.

Anyone else notice that the previous episode had a very similar premise with Molly? DS9 tends to do that.On the planet they find the long-decomposed remains of Cusak's body deep in a cave, having been dead for about three years.

1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Tears of the Prophets (TV Episode 1998)",They sure crammed a lot into one episode!,"""Tears of the Prophets"" is an absolutely amazing episode, as more happens in this one that in many two-part episodes! It's absolutely jam-packed with plot, action and significant events--making it a must-see season six finale.When the episode begins, the Federation thinks it's FINALLY about time to take the attack to the Dominion instead of fighting a defensive battle. The problem is that while the Klingons are ALWAYS ready to fight, the Romulans are happy to continue a defensive fight--so convincing them to join in is important. Oddly, however, just before departing DS9 for the fight, the Prophets tell Sisko not to go...but oddly, he goes anyway. Oops.So, life on the station should be pretty routine, huh? Not exactly. Dukat is now possessed with the dreaded Pah-Wraiths and this possessed jerk is bound for the station--and it will mean the death of one of the crew remaining on the station.Overall, this is a very exciting episode, though I am sure many were NOT happy to see a beloved series regular killed off. I didn't like it, but think killing a few regulars now and again isn't bad, as it heightens realism (it should NOT always be red shirts who die). Plus, I liked seeing that under a wig and some makeup, the leader of the Romulan fleet is David Birney--someone who folks of my generation should quickly notice and appreciate. Well worth seeing and mandatory viewing for fans of the series. And, incidentally, an excellent way to celebrate the 150th episode of the series.",10

A combined fleet of Star Fleet, Klingon and Romulan ships gathers at DS9 but on the eve of the battle Sisko is visited by the prophets who tell him that his place is near Bajor not leading the attack; he makes the choice that on this occasion his duty as a Star Fleet captain is greater than his duty as the Emissary. While Sisko and the fleet are away Dukat beams into the Bajoran shrine on DS9 and releases a Pah Wraith which wounds Jadzia and causes the orb to go dark; the wormhole suddenly opens then closes. At this moment Sisko senses something is wrong but isn't free to return. Once back on the station we learn that Jadzia could not be saved although the Dax Symbiont has survived. Unsure what he must do next Sisko returns home to Earth to contemplate the future.This was a great ending to the series with a shocking finale, the first time I watched the episode I certainly hadn't expected the death of Jadzia, especially after the talk about her planning to have a baby. Terry Farrell who played Jadzia so well will certainly be missed. This episode wasn't all darkness, showing Dr Bashir and Quark sulking together when they learn that Jadzia is planning to have a baby when they'd both convinced themselves that her relationship with Worf would not last provided some humour.

I thought ""Great, for once, the women of Trek are being payed Homage""And so I watched this with jaw dropped - As Season 6 Mytharcs came to a jarring conclusion.Previously in Season 6 Worf and Jadzia had been dancing around the idea of having a child. But there is still a war on, and Dukat is still on the loose.A huge opening is seen for an attack on Dominion Shipyards - One which cannot be ignored, the allied forces, which now include Romulans, must attack. And the man in charge is The Sisko, The Emissary of The Prophets to Bajor.Until The Prophets appear to The Sisko and tell him he is not to go. But The Sisko is also a Federation Officer - He cannot shirk his responsibilities to The Federation.And so this episode is a painful revelation that The Sisko is not just an ""Emissary"" - He is the Guardian of the Celestial Temple aka The Wormhole.But The Sisko cannot do both at once, and he is ordered to lead the attack. The new leader of Cardassia, Damar has created a planetary defense that is much like the Mines which Rom created to guard the Wormhole - They replicate themselves if blown up. The Federation is supposed to attack before these defenses are activated, but when did anything ever go as planned in a War?Meanwhile Jadzia has been put in charge of protecting The Station and The Wormhole - She makes a side trip to Bashir who after conducting some tests, informs her that she and Worf can become parents.And Dukat has not been idle- He has become informed on the Pah Wraiths, the Kossta Mogen. He meets with Damar with an idea of how they can get control of The Station again. IN fact, when did Dukat not have an ulterior motive? But in fact, the motive is not just his - It is the desire of the Pah Wraiths to take over the Temple of The Prophets.Dukat breaks a small Idol and releases Kossta Mogen and merges with it.And all things happen at once. The Planetary Defenses activate in the middle of the biggest Battle Royale of DS9 up to that point - The Prophets put The Sisko in a Trance - And Dukat invades the station and confronts Jadzia.The Kossta Mogen entity attacks Jadzia brutally and releases itself into the Orb which is in the Temple on DS9 - The Wormhole quivers and shudders and closes. The Sisko is greatly affected - Major Kira takes over and Garak finds a way to kill all of the defenses at once. This is one of the greatest space battles of all time.The Shipyards are destroyed, but the cost is way too much for The Sisko to take. And so, he says goodbye to his old friend of the last six years and heads to Earth until The Prophets tell him what he needs to do...If in fact they still exist.",10

This is truly sad because these personages become sort of family-like. The Federation decides to take the action to the Cardassians. They know this will be an overwhelming task. First, they need the Romulans to carry their weight. They are so self-consumed, it is hard to depend on them. Sisko is given control over the entire operation. Dukat, seen as a mad man by his own people, returns and takes on demon status. One of the things one forgets to notice is a really significant part of all wars. When the Federation takes on Cardassia, a huge number of Federation and Klingon vessels are destroyed. If i remember correctly, they contain huge crew numbers. Thousands are killed. When one cast member dies, it is horrible for Ben. We forget the cannon fodder. Once again, the Prophets are central to what is going on and the Bajorans can't seem to take two steps without them.

Here in the premier episode of season 5, Captain Sisko has been ordered to the Klingon home world to expose Gowron for what he is. But how...how will he get on the planet...how will he get near Gowron...and how will he show that the guy is really a pile of goo?! Well, the plan will naturally involve bringing Odo along--but Odo is busy feeling sorry for himself, as the Founders have made him a humanoid permanently--something that is very confusing and strange for him.Much of the show is spend with the away team members dressed up like Klingons--which is a lot of fun to watch. While Odo and O'Brien make crappy Klingons, Sisko is surprisingly good. As for Worf, well, he IS a Klingon! This portion of the show is cool--and it's exciting watching these Federation folks acting like drunk Klingons. Additionally, the show is pretty exciting and features a neat twist.

The only way to end the war is for Captain Sisko to take a group to infiltrate the heart of the Klingon Empire and expose Gowron. To do this Dr. Bashir performs an operation to make Sisko, O'Brien and newly-human Odo look Klingon. They are joined by Worf to pose as recipients of the 'Order of the Bat'leth', the Klingon's highest honour which is due to be presented by Gowron. All goes well until Sisko is recognised by General Martok and the team are all captured. When Martok quizzes them and hears that they think Gowron is a Changeling he admits that he had had suspicions and decides to let them go and help them get close enough to Gowron to kill him. Just as Worf is about to kill Gowron in single combat Odo realises something: Gowron is fighting in an honourable way yet Martok is behaving in a way no honourable Klingon would... it turns out Odo had been tricked into believing Gowron was a Founder so the Federation would kill him and thus insure the war would continue.This was a great season opener which nicely wrapped up the war with the Klingons. There are some good action scenes and the whole sequence on the Klingon home world was tense, there was a feeling that they could be exposed at any time. It was a lot of fun seeing Sisko, Odo and O'Brien looking like Klingons, until they spoke it wasn't easy to realise who each of them was. Until the final reveal I did not suspect that Gowron would turn out to be anything other than a Founder, it was a good surprise to learn that he wasn't.",9

The runabout in orbit is destroyed, one member of the away team is killed and another is seriously wounded. Surprisingly the Jem'Hadar don't storm the ship and the Vorta leading them invites Captain Sisko to talk, he claims salvage rights but she does not recognise his claim. It becomes clear she couldn't be trusted when a Jem'Hadar enters the ship and attacks O'Brien and Dax, luckily for them they are saved by wounded crew member Muñiz. The team struggle to get the ship in to a flyable state as well as trying to keep Muñiz from dying. The Vorta makes another offer to Sisko, this time she says they can have the ship on condition that they cam take a certain unnamed item first. Sisko refuses sure that they can't be trusted and that if such an offer were to be serious the item must be of enormous value so was worth fighting for.This was a gripping episode; as there were people on the away team who weren't main cast members it seemed likely that some of them might not make it, although I thought Muñiz would survive as he lasted so long after being wounded and had appeared in a couple of episodes already. F.J. Rio did a good job as Muñiz, it seemed like he was really suffering, Kaitlin Hopkins was also good as Kilana, the Vorta Sisko had to deal with even if she showed more of her impressive cleavage that was strictly needed... not that I'm complaining. When we learn what the precious cargo is it isn't much of a surprise but still it provided a good ending to the episode.

Unlike most Star Trek episodes there is no threat, instead it deals with the private lives of various members of the regular cast. In one story line it looks as if tensions are running high in the O'Brien household, not between Miles and his wife Keiko but between Miles and Major Kira, Keiko is happy for Miles to massage Kira's aching legs and even insists that he accompanies her when she says she is going to Bajor for a few days... after all she is carrying his child so it wouldn't be inappropriate. The only problem is that it is clear that Miles is having inappropriate feelings for the Major and is doing all he can to avoid her hoping they will go away. The second story involves another love triangle; when Quark's Klingon ex-wife Grilka turns up on the station he is determined to win her heart, the only problem is that Worf fell in love with her the moment he set eyes on her but as he is an outcast in Klingon society it is made clear that he has no chance with her. Quark's attempts to woo her lead to a challenge from her bodyguard, this would be certain death for Quark but using technology that effectively turns him into a puppet Worf fights the battle for him and he wins Grilka's affections... This leads to a great final scene where he is battered and bruised in sickbay... not from the fight but from what happened next and while the doctor is treating them Worf enters with a certain female crew member and it is clear that they had a similar night of passion.After some fairly serious episodes it was nice to have a good fun episode, it was fun watching Miles squirm as his wife unknowingly pushed him towards the woman he feared he was developing feelings for. The other story was even better; Mary Kay Adams was great in her guest role as Grilka and it was fun watching Worf play Cyrano de Bergerac by tutoring Quark in how to win the heart of the woman he himself loved but could never have.

They don't have long though till the Klingon's attack and when they do Jake must grab a rifle and fight if he is to survive.Up until now Jake had been a little to perfect, sure he didn't want to join Star Fleet but we had been told that he showed great promise as a writer. Here though we see that he is no less flawed than ordinary people of his age, and few of us know how we'd behave in such a situation so it is hard to condemn his character's actions. The only thing I wasn't so keen on in this episode was that when his father heard that Jake was in a combat zone he took the Defiant and flies for three days to get there, this doesn't seem that believable, after all it isn't his personal ship.",9

He arrogantly thinks that he will go to the medical outpost, have an experience, and write about it. The problem is that he sees death and experiences cowardice, his own and others. It is a major growth experience. He needs a rougher edge. Until he shows up at the makeshift hospital, he is still acting lice a child. We'll see.",6

However, Jake insists that they go--after all, he understands the risk and he's over 18. Plus, there is a part of Jake that wants to experience life since he has visions of being a brilliant writer. Instead of an exciting adventure, however, Jake finds that war sucks and makes you want to wet your pants!This is a decent episode--not great, but decent. But it also made me think of a few things. First, Dr. Bashir is the only doctor anywhere near the colony? That seems very odd. Second, what Jake learns is amazingly obvious--especially if he'd read ""The Red Badge of Courage"".

Personally, I loved this version--especially since 'normal' Keiko was one of the most boring recurring characters on the show. This is not a slam against the actress playing her, Rosilind Chao, as she could only be who the writers let her be. Unfortunately, the possessed Keiko only lasts this episode!

However, instead of just a special episode, the folks who made this went all out and really worked hard to create a treat for the Trekkers and Trekkies out there. How? Using modern technology, they formulated a good plot which allowed the series regulars on the show to impose themselves into one of the iconic episodes of the original series. So, using a combination of cleaned up original footage from ""Star Trek: The Trouble With Tribbles"", old-style cameras and new computer technology they were able to make an immensely clever episode.It all begins with some temporal agents visiting DS9. It seems that the crew members recently went back in time and the agents were there to make sure history was not changed and to punish everyone unless there was a darned good reason to make such a journey. What is the reason? A Klingon agent, Mr. Darvin, has arrived on DS9 and the crew later discover he's the same agent discovered at the end of ""The Trouble With Tribbles""--and he soon jumps back in time to undo his mistake and change history.There is so much to love about this episode. It was NOT hastily tossed together and it's fun seeing the new DS9 folks acting like fanboys and fangirls when they see their old heroes, such as James Kirk. Cute, fun and enjoyable even if you aren't familiar with the old series.",10

The Department Of Temporal Investigations Arrives at Deep Space Nine. Captain Sisko was escorting a 'human' named Arne Darvin back to Federation space and a marvelous adventure was set in motion, which Sisko wearily explains. During this trip the Orb Of Time was aboard the Defiant and Darvin uses it to transport them and ship back to Space Station K7 and sitting in space, the USS Enterprise, NCC1701. Arne Darvin had one motive, to kill Captain Kirk who was aboard the station. From here on in we see a marvelous mixture of classic Trek scenes from 'The Trouble with Tribbles'. The integration of these scenes and the mixture of dialog was incredible and a thoroughly believable story to go with it. Even the original Arne Darvin actor, Charlie Brill returned for this to cap it off. Sisko wearily explains what happened to Temporal investigations and they begrudgingly accept his explanation. The closing scene is funny and finished off a brilliant episode of this imaginative show",10
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Trials and Tribble-ations (TV Episode 1996)",Classic DS9 meets Classic original series,"While this episode might not have the best story in the series I think it is the most fun. While transporting the 'Orb of Time' and a passenger from Cardassia to the station it is activated and the Defiant finds itself back in time near a space station which is being visited by the USS Enterprise... the one captained by the one and only James Tiberius Kirk. It soon becomes apparent that the passenger who looked human was in fact a Klingon agent called Darvin and he has beamed off the Defiant. After changing into the uniforms of the time Sisko, Dax, Bashir and O'Brien beam over to the Enterprise and Odo and Worf head to the station to search for him. While looking for him they must be careful to keep any interaction with the crew of the Enterprise to a minimum to avoid contaminating the time line. This goes fairly well until after Bashir and O'Brien go to the station and along with Odo and Worf end up in a bar brawl between the crew of the Enterprise and a group of visiting Klingons. When they catch Darvin they learn that he has plans to kill Kirk in revenge for Kirk ruining his younger self all those years ago. This means the DS9 crew have a race against time to find the bomb that has been hidden in a Tribble before it can kill Kirk and change time forever. The story is told in flashback as Sisko tells investigators from the Department of Temporal Investigations, as it ends they clear the crew of any wrong doing... although there is one thing that Sisko omitted to tell them which I won't spoil.This episode was a lot of fun as it seamlessly integrated the DS9 crew into the original 1967 episode 'The Trouble with Tribbles', it even featured Charlie Brill as the older Darvin, reprising the roll he played in the original episode. There are several scenes showing the DS9 crew interacting with the original cast so well that if I didn't know could have believed the actors were really interacting. The episode nicely dealt with the fact that the appearance of the Klingons had changed. It was fun to see the DS9 crew in the old uniforms... particularly Dax; as she observed ""Women wore less"" back then; she even appears to catch Kirk's eye although given his reputation that isn't a surprise.

Kirk... and a space station full of furry tribbles.I recently purchased 'Star Trek: TOS' on Blu-Ray, and among its many bonuses were two non-TOS episodes featuring those furry fornicating tribbles. The first of the two was from the animated Trek series from the 1970s. The other was this retro cross-over episode made in conjunction with Trek's 30th anniversary. I'd only ever seen one episode of 'DS9' before. This one. Stumbling into it about half way through, I was amused and amazed by its clever execution. 20 years later, nothing's changed.I'm not familiar with the cast of 'DS9', their personalities or the hierarchy--both in terms of rank and character ""importance"" (though it's always truck me as a true ensemble in the spirit of 'TNG'). No matter. Here they're fans just like I am. They walk wide-eyed through the halls of the Enterprise, giggling like kids whenever one of the legends of that era make an appearance, and I was giggling right along with them. With the ""Trouble With Tribbles"" episode still fresh in my mind, I was really able to appreciate how well executed this episode is. What could've been a gimmick--and a bad one--was instead a fun, breezy blast of nostalgia that pulled off an exceptional technical feat by mid-90s standards. For the most part new and old blend seamlessly together, putting us right back into that classic episode, but seeing it from a completely new perspective. As I said, I don't really know the 'DS9' crew save for Worf and O'Brien, who were previously part of 'TNG', but I found myself liking them and have pledged to give 'DS9' a shot in the not too distant future (no pun intended).",8

There are so many people wandering the corridors, that they become relatively invisible.

We see them all: Kirk, McCoy, Spock, Scotty, Chekov, etc. They even speak to the new people and vice versa. One of the most endearing moments involves the fight in the commissary where a group of Klingons are throwing barbs at the Enterprise crew. Scotty becomes offended and punches the Klingon with the big mouth. What is great is that the original Klingons don't look anything like the later ones. There is no effort to explain it, but Worf point out that it is a long story. We never get to hear that story and that is fine.

Apart from the well done TOS decors and suits, the expert editing and the handsome Kirk presence to appeal to the original series fans, there isn't much about this episode per se that is worth seeing.I can understand why this anniversary episode is appreciated by the fans of the franchise, but a 9.4 rating (currently) is beyond ludicruous, it's laughable. Claiming that this was an ""immensely clever"" episode with ""brilliant acting and everything"" says a lot about the level of bias that turned this fake rating into a joke. It didn't stole a laugh, a tear or any kind of emotion from me, I just stood there baffled in front of the screen and asked myself: are they really going to make an episode about fluffy dolls?! Apparently, they could have even made a ""memorable"" episode where Captain Kirk kept scratching his backside for half an hour and it would still get a 9+ rating, just because it reminds people of Stark Trek the original series.

In a sense Tribbles are like babies - they do nothing, they make sounds, and pretty much... they do nothing. Oh, they're cute - if others say so. Myself, I find them boring, silly, stupid. They make Jake Sisko look like Hans Solo. That's a lot for fur balls that don't do anything except multiply. I don't get their purpose in this episode but obviously someone did because as I said it's a hit.
Anyway, remove them from the story line and you'll still have the story with about as much impact as, say, removing a couple chairs. Through the magic of SciFi the team ends up back in time on the old Enterprise. They get to meet Captain Kirk and walk through the old sets thanks to some very talented film magic. They search for a bomb meant for Kirk and I don't have to tell you how things go. History records he died somewhere else.

This alone is plenty of reason to hate this one!When the episode begins, Worf and Jadzia Dax are set to go away on a sexy vacation on the sexy planet of Risa. However, at the last minute, several interlopers invite themselves as well and Worf is positively rude to all of them. While you could understand his desire to have time alone with Jadzia, he is constantly rude towards everyone. Once they arrive, everyone but Worf seem eager to get their groove on with the very promiscuous and fun-loving Risans. As for Worf, he sulks. However, when a group of crazy and one- dimensional conservatives arrive and try to ruin everyone's fun, Worf, for the first time, seems nearly giddy. He likes their messages of fear and doom--and they seem like the perfect way to compliment a Klingon vacation. Eventually, however, and very unexpectedly Worf realizes his friends are butts and he does a 180 degree change in attitude--one that really makes no sense.The biggest problem with this show is that you feel like you are eavesdropping on a budding relationship between a supposedly sane woman and an abusive guy who feels he must control her every move. Instead of the pair inexplicably working past this at the end of the show, you really wish that she had obtained a restraining order and left the jerk!

It was not fun to watch at all. Some comedy mainly by Quark, the rest was just depressing and unconvincing.Michael Dorn was given a role and lines that were ridiculously childish and negative even for him, and it affected his performance, and this seemed to reflect onto the others as well.

This has the feel of a 1960's teenager movie. The characters are wooden and their motivations stupid beyond belief. Monte Markham, who showed up a lot in the Seventies and Eighties plays a moralist who simply huffs and puffs. The relationship between Dax and Worf is about as tiresome as one can imagine.",2

When they get there Worf in unimpressed by what he sees as a lack of morality, it doesn't help that they are met by a woman who had been involved with Curzon Dax... in fact she had been 'involved' with him at the moment he died, when he sees Bashir and Leeta involved with other people he becomes even more convinced that the whole planet is just an excuse for debauchery. When he meets a man called Fullerton he things has found somebody who things the same way; Fullerton is campaigning to get Risa closed down as he believes it symbolises all that is wrong with the Federation and that unless things change the Federation's enemies will see it as weak. He helps them with their activities by accessing the planet's weather control system, he doesn't realise that Fullerton intends to do more than cause a few days of rain though.I know that in anime it is common for a series to have a beach episode as an excuse to show cast members in swim suits but I didn't expect it in Star Trek. There are quite a few faults in this episode most obviously I do not believe for one second Worf would behave the way he did and as the relationship between the doctor and Leeta had only been fleetingly mentioned before there wasn't much of an impact went we learn that they are ending it, it was a bit of a surprise for the viewer, the doctor and Quark when she announces who she is interested in though!

Farrell- vacuous and stiff- has managed to make Dax lifeless and entirely unnecessary, and she ices the cake of her performance each week by speaking in a faint, flat voice, the result of her clearly not having enough air in her lungs to push the dialogue out through her lips. Maybe that's why she had to overdub every single one of her lines. As an actress Terry Farrell is a cadaver, a comatose shell, and her performance is a crime against the craft of acting.In recent episodes Dax has suddenly become the biggest in space, with multiple, head-scratching references made to her extensive sexual history and unbridled lust. It's even revealed in the Deep Space 9 TOS flashback ""Trials & Tribble-ations"" that Dax slept with Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy. Read that sentence again. Now a third time if you have to. It doesn't help, does it? Dax is vocal and obnoxious about taking a vacation with Worf to Risa so they can bang each other's brains out in private. She smiles cluelessly and without shame, and urges the senior staff of DS9 to loosen up and get laid, but not before we're treated to a graphic description of Klington/Trill intercourse. ""I pulled my neck fugging,"" Dax tells Odo and Sisko, grinning gleefully, without even a hint of guilt or self-awareness. Also Vanessa Williams shows up as Dax's lesbian lover for some reason. Are we vomiting yet? Someone needs to slap Terry Farrell so hard that the echo from the resulting crack makes schoolchildren weep.Not to be outdone by Dax's boggling behavior is Alexander Siddig as medical paperweight Julian Bashir. He raises one eyebrow and engages in sexual innuendo so inane and juvenile it would make a twelve year-old boy blush. It seems Julian likes sex, and the act of having sex, and he wants to have as much sex with his dabo cupcake Leeta as he can. Because of the sex. Did I mention sex? In ""Without Sin,"" Star Trek- originally conceived as a high-minded science fiction anthology built on themes of discovery and human nature- melts inexplicably into a broad, goofy, exploitive sex-com as a ragtag band of space station crew misfits hit the road to bust a nut and learn a little something about love, sex, and the true meaning of Christmas. Gene Roddenberry must be rolling over in his torpedo tube on Genesis. This episode is nothing less than an absolute bastardization of the Trek name and the ideals for which it stands... it is a tumor... it is a crime.My attack on this episode may seem severe but it is in my opinion well-deserved. My criticism of Terry Farrell may seem harsh, but I have patiently waited five years for this actress to display even a trace of talent or energy. I have waited five years for her to TRY. Frankly I'm tired of waiting. If she can't be bothered to even make an attempt then I can't be bothered to show her any sympathy. ""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone,"" says the Bible passage. (John 8:7) *tossing a jagged rock at Terry Farrell's face* Avoid this junk. It's not Star Trek.

Deep Space Nine has done its best to show us the warped Lifetime movie version of this future. We're given Worf, who is the very picture of nastiness, controlling behavior, emotional abuse, and childish lashing out. In the other corner, Dax, who, despite being hundreds of years old, can hardly work up the will and self-esteem to do more than vaguely chide her abuser. The story plays out as a redemptive (and barely, at that) fairy tale suited for small children who don't understand that the real world and its problems aren't so simply resolved. Any sane woman with even a modicum of self-esteem would have told Worf to go to hell and given him explicit directions on the quickest route. Instead, Dax plays the role of a battered woman, too insecure and too beaten down by her abuser to take a strong stand against his behavior and treatment of her. When a story somehow becomes even more hysterically unbelievable than the aforementioned Lifetime-style movie, you know you're watching a show hit rock bottom.I was especially fascinated by the way Worf managed to win Dax's unconditional sympathy back by telling an obvious lie about his childhood, where he learned to be completely controlled and restrained because of a horrifying incident in his past. Mind you, at the beginning of the episode, Dax had been to the infirmary several times just in the last month because of Worf's apparently violent and unrestrained Klingon lovemaking, yet she believes him when he claimed he was too traumatized by a childhood incident to let loose. It was clearly a lie on his part to win her back, another classic abuser trope where the abusive partner tries to gain forgiveness by appealing to his victim's sympathy by seeming to actually be deep and troubled rather than shallow and nasty. I'm sure the writers didn't intend for the story to be a lie, but the evidence is clear.Just an unpleasant story with unpleasant connotations written by the sort of unpleasant minds who would actually believe a relationship like this could turn out healthy in any way.",2
0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Things Past (TV Episode 1996)",Great Episode with one minor flaw,"Fantastic episode that gives us a look into how things were on the space station during the occupation while the Cardassians were running it. The episode has a fantastic cold bleakness to it and highlights a storyline that sheds more light on Odo. Character development episodes are some of my favorites, I always enjoy an opportunity to glimpse the main characters as they were before we officially ""met"" them. My only problem with the episode is that at the very end they make Kira Nerys seem like a judgmental hypocrite. I find it incredibly annoying to listen to a person who is a self-admitted terrorist pass judgement on the past actions of her associates/friends, right or wrong. I think it's a injustice to an otherwise wonderful character. Other than that small point, I thought this episode was one of the better ""darker"" episodes. And the guest stars make this episode a 9 instead of a 7.5",9
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Things Past (TV Episode 1996)",Odo's mistake in the past,"As Sisko, Dax, Odo and Garak return from a conference on Bajor something strange happens; instead of finding themselves back on DS9 it appears they are on the station seven years previously when it was under Cardassian control. It isn't a simple case of time travel though as everybody on the station sees them as Bajorans, it would appear that they are somehow inhabiting the bodies' of Bajorans. When they learn who's bodies they are inhabiting Odo recognises their names; they were all executed for an attempt on Gul Dukat's life when Odo was in charge of security and he later discovered that they were innocent. Clearly something is the matter with time as at this time Odo should be there but his predecessor is still there. Despite the differences it appears that history of repeating itself when Dukat is indeed attacked, they are arrested and must try to either escape or persuade the Cardassians of their innocence.After a couple of lighter episodes this one provided a real mystery; how did they get to the past, why are they occupying the bodies of people Odo wrongly convicted and why aren't things quite as they should be? The explanation came as a surprise but it was a good explanation and I won't spoil it here. When they get back and Kira learns of Odo's involvement in the deaths of three innocent Bajorans it looks as though their friendship might be damaged.",8

All dark and gritty and dirty, with Cardassians abusing Bajorans for the slightest mistake.Quark is also in his natural element here. We see him here as he was before, and makes us understand in some way how he is 'today' and how he has changed a bit since the Cardassians were kicked out of the station.The main cast in this episode does an excellent performance, especially Rene Auberjonois. He is of course always good, but here he is incredible.Our favorite recurring guest actors in the form of Gul Dukat and Garak also perform above par here. Kurtwood Smith - one of my favorite actors since the first RoboCop (1987) movie - also helps to lift this episode up a few notches.The reason I didn't give it a 10 is that I found it a bit confusing and hard to follow at times.Overall, a 'must see' episode for anyone following the story of DS9, in my opinion.",8

And, by the end of the show when you're given an explanation, it still doesn't make a lot of sense. In many ways, I'd consider this among the worst of the season 5 episodes--though the one that immediately preceded this one was even worse!The show begins with Odo, Sisko, Garak and a few others suddenly finding themselves on the station seven years earlier. The place is once again run by the Cardassians and the Bajorans are slaves. Inexplicably, the DS9 crew members (and even Garak) are seem by every one as just another group of slaves! And, instead of Odo being in charge of security, some Cardassian is--though they eventually realize this isn't right--seven years ago, Odo SHOULD have been in this role. What does all this mean? I dunno...well, perhaps the show explained it but it all didn't make any sense and just felt like the show could have used a re-write or two to make the thing more rational.",3
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Things Past (TV Episode 1996)",Very Edgy,"I have to agree with another reviewer that at times it really challenged my acceptance of events. First of all, the fact that the four of them are back in time at a critical moment in the revolution is suspect. I know Bajir tries to explain how it all happened, but I'd have to read his treatise to buy into that. There are questions about who is who and who is victimized and who Odo actually is. He ends up reporting the events and apparently, as chief of security back then, he sent three innocent people to their deaths. He tries to change history, but we all know how that goes. This is an extremely harsh episode. There is little or no lightness to it and half the time we don't understand the jumps. Surreal would be the best descriptor. I sort of enjoyed it, but have to admit my limited understanding.",8
0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Ascent (TV Episode 1996)",Can't we all just learn to get along?!,"This episode of ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" finds two pairs of folks stuck together who must somehow find a way to cooperate. The most important of these pairings is Quark and Odo. Both are on the way to some tribunal--but Odo won't tell Quark what it is. On the way to this distant planet, their runabout explodes--as someone has planted a bomb in order to prevent Quark from testifying about what he knows. Unfortunately, while they do survive, they land on a craptastic planet with no food and very cold--which is REALLY bad since their food supplies and replicator were destroyed in the crash! How can they possibly survive?The secondary plot involves Jake moving into an apartment on the station with Nog. The problem is that these old friends have changed--particularly Nog. Instead of the fun-loving rascal, he's now deadly serious and orderly as a result of his having such a strong commitment to Starfleet. As for Jake, he's a bit of a slob-- like most teenagers! Can two old friends share an apartment together without driving each other crazy?This is a decent but not especially important episode. The best part is that Quark and Odo are forced to depend on each other--and they NEVER let down their facade in front of the other. Less humorous than most Ferengi episodes but worth seeing.By the way, in an inside joke for old Star Trek fans, during their long trip together Quark suggests they kill time playing Fizbin. Fizbin is a fake game that Kirk created in ""A Piece of the Action"" in order to trick his way out of the hands of his captors.",7
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Ascent (TV Episode 1996)",Odo and Quark must climb a mountain,"This episode has two separate story lines; in the main story Odo is attempting to take Quark to face a grand jury on a planet which requires then to travel alone together for a week in a small shuttle. On the way they get on each others nerves until Quark hears a strange buzzing noise, at first Odo is dismissive but soon he can hear it too and a search leads them to discover a bomb. They managed to beam it off the ship but it exploded during transport causing enough damage to make them land on the nearest planet. The rough landing has left the shuttle's communication system damaged. It is unable to broadcast through the atmosphere so the two of them most carry the system to the top of a high mountain. It will not be an easy journey as the mountain is large, the planet is cold and they have limited rations. The secondary story involved Jake moving out of his father's quarters to live with his old friend Nog who has just returned from Star Fleet Avademy. Jake was expecting to have a fun time with his mischievous friend but after a year at the Academy Nog is now far more disciplined and expects Jake to keep the room tidy and get up at four each morning to exercise, clearly both of them need to compromise and meet in the middle.This was a decent episode with some thrills in the main story where it looks as if Quark and Odo won't make it as well as some character development for the main characters, particularly Quark and Odo, it is great seeing them bickering, it is clear that while they profess to hate each other they would miss then if anything happened to them. It was rather nice to see a planet that didn't look like the semi desert worlds they usually visit.",8
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Ascent (TV Episode 1996)",Equal Tiring One-upsmanship,"I guess that on some levels, this is entertaining. Odo and Quark must fight for their lives on a harsh planet. The problem is the constant backbiting. I know they have been adversaries, but if one thinks there is anything admirable about Odo's behavior here, think again. He shows a total lack of professionalism. It is perpetual sarcasm. Granted, Quark is a case, but he has more reason to feel persecuted than his friend. We have seen them spar over and over again, but this time it's life or death. I just got tired of hearing them complain.",6

Unfortunately, as I make my way through Season 5, another romp in the Bajoran mythos just kind of turns me off. The whole Emissary thing is a bit much. I remember when Ben went to the surface and again got zapped (sort of; he's been zapped on numerous occasions) and the Bajorans embraced him. As I watch them wandering around the space station, it's hard to believe that they ever started a revolution. Sisko gets caught up in the puzzle presented by an obelisk that is found in the Lost City. The results involve the contrived situation of Jake having to make a game-changing decision. I don't know. For me, the Bajorans are so tiresome.",6
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Rapture (TV Episode 1996)","Well, I liked it....","I noticed one of the other reviews on IMDb for this episode REALLY hated this episode--referring to it as 'mumbo jumbo'. Well, I can respect their opinion but I actually liked it. Perhaps this is because I've already seen all the episodes and know where it's all heading. The bottom line is that there is an odd religious angle to the series and it's probably something you'll either love or hate. And, I must admit that there is a lot of stuff that ain't exactly typical of other sci-fi TV shows!When the episode begins, Captain Sisko is looking at an odd obelisk that was discovered on Bajor. But soon he becomes VERY transfixed with the object--neglecting sleep, eating or his other duties. It turns out that he's having visions that are being given to him by the Prophets. In fact, one of these leads him to discover a previously hidden holy city--an astounding find indeed. But, it's also very bad because the visions are taking a toll on him and unless they can get him away from the obelisk and operate, he'll die. It's also very bad because the visions don't fit in with the Federation and its plans. This is a weird episode full of mumbo jumbo--but I liked it and the overall plot and LOVE where it eventually leads (the final few episodes are mind blowing, believe me). Watch it and try to withhold judgment until you see the rest.",8

Before he solves the mystery there is an accident and soon after he begins to have visions. This is happening at a bad time as Bajor is due to join the Federation and Sisko is meant to be taking a leading role in the ceremony. His visions do lead to the discovery of the city but they also start to make him ill but even though Dr. Bashir says it could kill him he refuses to be treated believing he has more to learn from his visions. Indeed his next vision tells him something that comes as a shock to everybody and will have profound implications for the future of Bajor.This was a fairly good episode which returns to a plot thread which started all the way back in the first episode, namely whether or not Bajor would join the Federation. I quite liked the fact that we weren't shown Sisko's visions, this helped maintain a sense of mystery.",8
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Rapture (TV Episode 1996)",Ridiculous Bajoran mumbo jumbo,"Seemingly all DS9 episodes that try to glorify Bajoran culture end up making them look more and more annoying. Largely, this is because all these efforts are based on ideas with gaping holes.Here for example, Sisko gets electrocuted and starts having prophetic visions (no reason why). With these he discovers an ancient Bajoran metropolis. By which I mean he discovers the ruins of one obelisk. In a cave. Because lost cities built on plains have huge caves growing around them. In just about 20000 years, which is how old this city is - at this point we are expected to marvel at the ancient civilisation of the Bajorans, who by the way, in a previous (also bad) episode, were revealed to have built (in fact dysfunctional) light sail spaceships with which they reached Cardassia. Now, these spaceships were 800 years before, yet they had already faded into the sphere of legend and Bajorans couldn't be sure of their existence. Yet this amnesiac people retains evidence of a prehistoric city.These are pretty large plot holes but not what makes this episode very bad. That would be the way in which Sisko turns into a ""prophets"" faithful, and stops Bajor from joining the Federation by warning them about locusts. Yes, locusts. What is really questionable is how and why the Federation would ever even remotely consider the application of a planet whose rulers can be swayed over by a delirious madman warning them about locusts. There have been bad Star Trek episodes over the years, but this one stands out, not as the worst, but possible as the most un-Star Trek like I have seen. Its logic goes against all things Star Trek. To put it simply, Cpt Picard wouldn't let this stand.",2
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Rapture (TV Episode 1996)",Faith in Star Trek,"I really liked this episode of Deep Space 9.It sets the tone & the importance of the Emissary even more. This is an episode about faith.Faith in believing in something that may surpass you (which is a good thing), and when you go too far for some things in the name of faith.Faith is one of the best traits of man and it shapes our very nature (faith in a god, faith in ourselves, faith in humanity etc).But like all things, but put too much faith and it may lead into zealotry. In this episode we see all kinds of faith.From the prophet (sisko) who is willing to kill himself for visions, to Sisko's family (belief in son/husband), to the simple believer (kira), to the scientific believer or non believer (dax, bashir), to the organized believer (kai winn) and to the neutral observer/non-believer (Admiral Whatley).And what a finale from Cpt. Sisko and a honest answer to the admiral.Once again, DS9 is dealing with a sensitive matter, and delivers.",10
5,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Rapture (TV Episode 1996)",Babylon 5 within Deep Space Nine,"Bashir's Uniform is ""A Little Brighter""- Obviously, because DS9 started using the new First Contact uniforms.Ironically, we have to remember something about Bashir, or rather, the ""Bashir"" who was wearing the new uniform in this and the next three episodes. Because Bashir is also still wearing his Old DS9 uniform- Maybe I should stop there, and wait until everyone has seen ""In Purgatory's Shadow"" - Then it will become clear how and why Bashir could be wearing a new uniform and an old uniform at the same time. And it is one of those typical things from this show that causes the jaw to drop.Now, it offends me when people unfairly pan episodes simply because they are exploring something about Faith. And Worf says it here: During a discussion about the Bajoran's Religion and The Emissary in particular, Kira is being ribbed by O'Brien and Dax. But Worf tells her to take heart, not because he shares the same religion with Kira, but because he believes in FAITH. And if you consider Worf for one minute, if you consider the character from all of The Next Generation, you will realize he is one of the most religious people in the Trek 'Verse. He rigidly adheres to his Klingon heritage, while at the same time religiously adhering to Starfleet's Principles- His Faith allows him to retain Personal Honour even when his own countrymen consider him a pariah.But that is because he is a man of Deep Faith and convictions, he never makes fun of anyone Else's religion, be it an Earth religion, or the religion of Bajor. But he won't put up with Hypocrisy, either.And the point of this episode is mainly ""The Sisko"", he has started to accept that he IS ""The Emissary"" of the Prophets to Bajor, but until now, he was maybe not willing to do everything they are requiring of him.Most people of real Faith struggle with this all the time, they question: ""Is Ghod/Buddha/Krishna/YWHW/Moroni/etc, really asking me to do this?"" - Most of the time, I can tell you from experience, probably not. If you have to think twice about it, it's NOT HIM. It's my personal belief that if Ghod wants something from us, we'll know it- There will be no question about it. The way to tell is that it will be something 180 degrees in reverse of what the person would expect to be asked to do.The thing about Trek is that it treats religion with RESPECT, Trek explores our Terran religions by these episodes which tell us about The Emissary, the Prophets and The Bajoran Religion. They even dissect the concept of hypocrisy, in such a way as to not pan any religions of Earth, but to simply ask people, if they are really doing God's Will, or their own, in Ghod's Name? This is something I ask people who wish to put restrictions on me, whose will is it? Gods, or yours? Usually it's their agenda only and God enters into it not.The Religion of Bajor also delves into the concept of Prophecy, which most people think has something to do with seeing the future. That's only part of it, Real prophecy is a bit more complicated.As far as the DS9 story goes, The Sisko is being shown some of the things that will happen soon, he just doesn't know what it all means. Yet. Some of the blanks are just not filled in. It was a clever way to foreshadow the last episodes of season 5, in the form of Visions from The Prophets.If there are any fans of the great J Michael Stracynski show ""Babylon 5"", you might see a parallel to when Ambassador Mollari is beaten up by G'Kar and sees a vision of ""The Shadows"" landing on his home world of Centauri Prime. The only difference between B5 and DS9 is that on B5, this is actually SHOWN ""as a Vision"" that Mollari has. It might have been more effective to show what The Sisko was seeing, but even without any visual cues we understand what will happen.Somehow, I felt that Babylon 5 and DS9 were telling a parallel story, many of the same things happen, The Centauri and The Cardassians: They both make the same mistake and both suffer similar consequences.",10
6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Rapture (TV Episode 1996)",nope,"While the episode may be fairly well executed and somewhat enjoyable (even if it felt like Close Encounters of the Third Kind), the territory it ventures into goes against what I feel Star Trek stands for. Unless these supernatural visions have a clear explanation in future episodes this does not bode well for the series. Confronting and discussing the idea of faith is not a bad thing if handled properly as done in previous episodes (especially with Kai Winn, who embodies the power hungry organized institution surrounding faith), but this one misses the mark and also really calls into question Sisko's character. 2/10 just so it's one better than the even worse Risa episode earlier in the season, which should never have been produced in the first place.",2

Odo manages to create a list of suspects and tells the Major that he will continue to narrow it down. She however decides to take matters into her own hands and steals the list and heads off to find the killer; an action that nearly gets her killed.This episode was pretty exciting; I had an idea who was guilty but it turned out I was wrong, not that it was possible to guess the killer's identity as there was no mention of him until the end. It was interesting to learn a bit more about Kira's time in the resistance and to see how brave she is when facing almost certain death. My only real complaint about the episode was that the killer was far to theatrical when he taunted Kira after capturing her, still it wasn't bad enough to spoil the episode.",8

His portrayal of Odo brought forth one of Trek's most unusual and interesting characters. In this we see a broken man stripped of his shape shifting abilities and how he sees the universe from human eyes. When he buys a baby changeling from Quark this gets moving. His affection towards it is touching but the real powerhouse in this show was Star Trek alumni James Sloyan as Doctor Mora, the scientist who discovered Odo. Another favorite of mine. His 'fatherly' attitude with Odo is brilliantly written. The birthing of the O'Brien's baby was real nice too but didn't detract from the Odo story. Near the end, when Odo finally comes to understand what Doctor Mora did for him we get to see an emotional side, not often seen in Odo.

It is the latter of these two that provides the main story. When Odo first gets the young changeling it can't change shape and none of his attempts to help it learn seem to work. When the Bajoran who raised him arrives on the station Odo is determined not to let the methods used to raise him would not be used on the baby. Eventually however he come to agree that perhaps those methods might not be as bad as he remembered. The youngster is soon mimicking simple shapes and even forms a crude approximation of a face. Odo is overjoyed and begins celebrating, he is soon interrupted however and told that there is something very wrong with the youngster. While Odo comes to terms with the impending death of the youngster it gives him a surprising parting gift. While Odo's story is fairly downbeat over all light relief is provided by the behaviour of those waiting for Kira to give birth; it was clear that Kira's boy friend wasn't too keen on the attention O'Brien gave her even though he was only doing it because she was carrying his child.This was a good episode where Rene Auberjonois did a fine job as Odo, showing a wide range of emotions from the joy of getting the young changeling, the frustration of having to use the methods used on him and the sadness of realising the youngster would not live. The story was perhaps a little too close to 'The Next Generation' story 'The Offspring' but as I really liked that episode too I didn't mind the similarities.",9

It seems that Bajoran women only give birth when they are totally relaxed (and it involves a lot of annoying 'music'). Soon, unfortunately, the tension levels rise and it looks as if she'll never have the baby for the O'Briens.In some ways this was a touching episode--at least the Odo portions.

But the writers have taken this too far by letting Sisko fight a very dirty fight, if you can even call it a fight. A Starfleet Captain would never do this and if he would his crew should refuse to cooperate. It's an exciting episode and i like the analogy with ""Les Miserables"" so i won't give it a one, but this is not something i would like to see more of in Star Trek.

But you know what? That doesn't excuse anything Sisko did this episode. He was wrong at every turn.But want I cannot accept, cannot forgive, is Benjamin launching two biogenic weapons at a planet inhabited by anyone. There is no tit-for- tat. The possibility that someone would die on that planet, that they would A} not believe Captain Benjamin Sisko of Starfleet capable of doing such an abhorrent act or B} Someone willing to intentionally sacrifice themselves to bloody Sisko's name is too likely.The true fact is, that all of the crew who could have done something to keep those torpedoes from launching should be ashamed of themselves. The plea that they were 'just following orders' always rings hollow to me. The show should've ended that season, with all involved being court-marshaled, including Eddington.",1

3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" For the Uniform (TV Episode 1997)",Sisko and the Great White Whale,"I have to agree with the reviewers who see Eddington as a pain in the butt, but whose life is trivial against the backdrop of mass homicides. Sisko is obsessed because he is so caught up in Starfleet rules that he sees Eddington as above everything. The Maquis are rebels and cause a great deal of trouble, impinging on the treaty with the Cardassians, but do their people deserve to die violent deaths because of the actions of an unbalanced Captain trying to do away with the little twerp who is beyond reclamation. His actions at the conclusion are reprehensible and show that he has made himself judge, jury, and executioner. In recent episode we have seen more and more instability with Sisko.",6
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" For the Uniform (TV Episode 1997)",Sometimes moral ambiguity....,"Is made even more ambiguous by the fact that certain aspects aren't actually ambiguous.The interesting thing about the Les Mis discussion is that nobody actually comes out and points out the most pertinent flaw in the analogy -- Valjean stole bread to feed his family while Eddington has resorted to mass murder. Over and above Sisko's obsession, Eddington is an extremely dangerous man, not only because he's convinced he's right but because he will gladly kill numerous civilians to achieve his goal. This is not some hypothetical game of who's morally superior or who betrayed whom or who has a legitimate grievance. This is a hunt for a psychopath.The morality of Sisko's actions is very much up for debate, of course, and it's interesting to see this episode being written and aired at a time before the ""War on Terror"" and its excesses (though it followed the Cold War, where the same issues by state actors were just as pervasive and just as troubling.) Though it seems clear that the colonists were not in any immediate danger of dying before they could be evacuated -- if they were likely to die, this would be an entirely different discussion -- Sisko's actions have clearly taken the show into a much darker place than the usual Star Trek franchise, a place it has already begun to inhabit anyway. And yet I don't really share the concerns of other reviewers here. The time had come for the Star Trek universe to explore the unpleasant realities of war and terrorism in a fashion that wasn't restricted to the ""other"" -- the inhuman Borg, the violent conqueror Klingons, the treacherous Romulans, etc were all easily put into a category of clear and unambiguous threats to the ""Federation way of life."" But the idealistic visions that permeated TOS and TNG eventually had to crack under the weight of the universe-building that ST had been engaged in since the 1960s. At some point, portrayals of utopian fantasies run out of steam and Monsters of the Week start to become repetitive. So this episode was a crucial juncture in the expansion of the ST universe. Out in the far edges of the quadrant, things stop being resolved with a brilliant technobabble exploit and a few pithy words about how things are back to normal. When we are shocked by the actions of a character on a TV show, and Sisko's actions were shocking and difficult to consider acceptable, we can move on with the realization that our belief that we understood the nature of the world we've been presented might not be quite as solid and predictable as we thought.",8

This leads him to a confrontation in the Badlands which should provide Sisko with an easy victory; unfortunately for him he hadn't realised that Eddington had left a parting gift when he left Star Fleet; a virus which scrubs the Defiant's computer memory. Left drifting Sisko has to get towed back to DS9, once back he informed that he is no longer responsible for bringing Eddington to justice as he is clearly taking things far too seriously. After an attack on a Cardassian colony Sisko decides to take the Defiant out again even though many of its systems are still down because no other ship is close enough to intercept Eddington. Following a signal into the Badlands Sisko is tricked once again and taunts him, comparing him to Javert, the police man in 'Les Misérables' who spends his life tracking down a man suspected of a trivial crime. After another attack on a Cardassian Colony Sisko realises that Eddington sees himself as the hero fighting for the needy so if he wants to defeat him he must play the villain. To this end he takes the Defiant to a Marquis colony and announces that he will poison the atmosphere making the planet uninhabitable to humans if Eddington doesn't surrender... surely Sisko is bluffing, or is he? This was an exciting episode which provided some good character development for Captain Sisko as the situation led him to take actions I didn't expect to see any Star Fleet captain would take let alone one who is the main character in a series. It was good that he did though, it means it won't come as a shock if he has to take drastic action in the likely war with the Dominion.",9

Now in ""For the Uniform"" Captain Sisko is out looking for Eddington in order to bring him for justice. However, again and again, Eddington seems to outsmart them. I liked this part quite a bit. Unfortunately, Eddington talks about this pursuit of him as being like ""Les Miserables""--with Sisko being Javert and Eddington as the innocent Jean Valjean. This part of the show seemed more forced--plus I think likening Sisko and his task to Captain Ahab in ""Moby Dick"".

This being Garak of course it was far from trivial but a message from his presumed dead mentor Enabran Tain. He attempts to steal a runabout but is caught by Dr. Bashir who takes him to to Captain. Garak manages to persuade him that the signal should be investigated as there are also Federation personnel missing in the Gamma Quadrant. Soon Garak is on his way accompanied by Worf. Approaching Dominion territory they enter a nebula to avoid detection, unfortunately the nebula contains a Jem'Hadar fleet which is so large that it can only be preparing for an invasion of the Alpha Quadrant. Before capture they manage to send a warning which while garbled is clear enough for the people on DS9 to know they must act fast if they are to prevent an invasion; this will entail blocking the wormhole which would trap Garak and Worf on the wrong side. These two find themselves in a Dominion prison where they learn Enabran Tain is alive along with Klingon General Martok, somebody else they know is there too, Doctor Julian Bashir and he has been there for two months, clearly the one on DS9 must be a changeling and there in no guessing what he may have done in those two months.This was a great episode, which wasn't a surprise as Garak played a major part in the story and Andrew Robinson is great in the role. I was really surprised when the Dr. Bashir was revealed on the station was revealed to be a changeling, it would be interesting to re-watch the preceding episodes to see if there were any clues, I certainly didn't suspect a thing.

The new enemies, the Dominion and their army of Jem'Hadar, were excellent baddies and meant that instead of slow and cerebral episodes, more violent and intense episodes would be to come. Here in part 1 of a 2 part series, the violence level increases, as hostilities from the Dominion seem about to break out once again.When the show begins, the station intercepts a faint Cardassian signal emanating from the Gamma Quadrant. When Garak is asked to translate the message, he says it's meaningless and unimportant-- which obviously means it's important! So, when Garak tries to escape the base to investigate, Worf is waiting to catch him and the two go on the mission together. Unfortunately, the Jem'Hadar show up and take the two prisoner.

In this first part, Garak talks the Captain into allowing him to search for his old mentor, who may have sent a message. Had they not gone, they would not have been able to warn the station that Dominion soldiers were coming, en masse, to the wormhole and, of course, bringing death and destruction to the entire Quadrant.

This is no surprise because what he did to the Bajorans during his reign is nothing short of sadistic. His daughter, whom he supposedly adores, is thrown to the flames at the first sign of rebelliion (I don't mean literally, of course).

The episode sees Bashir being selected by Lewis Zimmerman (the creator of the Doctor in 'Star Trek: Voyager') to be a model for the Mach II version of the Emergency Medical Hologram. Bashir is initially flattered only for his pride to turn to horror when he realises Zimmerman intends to interview everyone close to him, including his estranged parents. It soon becomes clear that Bashir has ever reason to fear this intrusion as he and his family are hiding a rather dark secret.It is fascinating to learn more of Bashir's background and see the character interact with his parents, especially his father who is so different from the staunch Starfleet doctor, as well as O'Brien. It was also a interesting to see secrets come spilling out on subject that is quite relevant in today's society (I won't say why in deference to those who haven't seen the episode yet). The acting in this episode from Alexander Siddig (who plays Bashir) and his supporting co-stars was top-notch and the story came together well. Definitely up there among DS9's best episodes.",9

Julian is not pleased and it soon becomes apparent that he has secrets that he does not want revealed. Unfortunately when is parents go to see him they don't realise that they are not talking to their son but to the new hologram; they promise not to tell a secret that could lead to them being imprisoned and Dr. Bashir forced to leave Star Fleet. While off duty Dr. Zimmerman takes a liking to Leeta and tries to persuade her to move to Jupiter Station with him to take over the running of the bar there; she nearly takes the job but at the last moment Rom finally plucks up the courage to tell her how he feels about her.This was an enjoyable episode which taught us something new about Dr Bashir. Robert Picardo, best known as Voyager's holographic doctor, makes a welcome guest appearance as Dr. Zimmerman; he is great in Voyager and was no less good here. Brian George was very entertaining as Julian's embarrassing father and Chase Masterson was delightful as Leeta, it wasn't surprising that Zimmerman fancied her and not just because she showed her impressive cleavage. The story had a good conclusion which saw Bashir's father take responsibility for what he did to help his son and Zimmerman clearly wasn't going to miss Leeta for long when a pretty Cardassian girl catches his eye.

What gives?This is a particularly poor episode for Major Kira, as her character seems so incredibly poorly written.

As good a general as he is, he had been a prisoner of the Jem Ha'Dar for two years while his Doppelganger set the Empire on a War-Tangent.Martok was rescued by Worf and Garak in the excellent two-parter ""In Purgatory's Shadow/By Inferno's Light,"" but this is the first Command given to Martok after that harrowing experience which they narrowly escaped. Is he up to it?Worf agrees to be Martok's first officer, and Jadzia-Dax tags along, as science officer. As good a Klingon Worf is, he does not recognize the danger signals brewing on the Ro'Tarran, it takes Dax to confront him with it, and now it is up to Worf to Assassinate Martok if Martok cannot command the ship. Can he do it, and will he do it?This was an excellent look into Life on a Klingon Ship. We saw a little of this in the Season 2 Next Generation Episode ""A Matter of Honour"" and a little more when Worf and Kurn pilot a Bird of Prey in ""Redemption"" and Kurn kills a flock of Bird of Prey using a sun.But those were just quick glimpses of Klingon Ships: We never got any elongated visits to a Klingon Bridge. Here, we begin as Worf accepts the Ro'Tarran's Battle Record and we stay on The Ro'Tarran while Worf and Dax learn to deal with the low spirits of the Ro'Tarran crew.Dax as Curzon was an ""expert"" in all things Klingon, Jadzia claims she has nothing but a passing interest. But here, it is shown she may as well have a bumpy forehead rather than Trill Spots, because she blends right in with the Ro'Tarran crew. She was the one who showed Worf the trouble the crew was in, and Worf eventually makes a decision designed to ultimately get Martok off of his passive bIng pItlh and into Battle!Worf succeeds brilliantly. Martok initially thinks Worf is a Traitorous Patak, but in pItlh-sight, realizes that Worf had given him incentive to properly command his Ship.Martok joins Worf to his own house in gratitude for this.This episode gives us something we had never before seen in Trek: Life on a Klingon Ship. This was done so well here, a show could have been designed around it.As Deep Space Nine progressed, we got to see several more shows which took place on The Ro'Tarran: Tough Little Ship.

After all, the new Cardassian/Dominion alliance is almost unstoppable and the Empire needs good officers. Unexpectedly, however, Jadzia Dax also wants to come along and serve aboard this ship. What follows SHOULD have been an honor-filled adventure where the ship blew the crap out of anything that came near it--it IS the Klingon way. However, unexpectedly Martok seems to be very hesitant to engage the enemy and the crew begins grumbling loudly. By tradition, it's up to the First Officer (Worf) to challenge his superior and fight him to the death--so what is Worf going to do?Like most of the Klingon episodes, this one is exciting and full of manly action and violence.

Realising that the crew is on the point of mutiny Worf challenges Martok for control of the ship; he loses deliberately but the taste of combat shows Martok what he needs to do and by the time they are back at DS9 they are covered in glory.This was a good episode, given that it was centred on a Klingon ship it came as quite a surprise that the leading character turned out to be Dax, she noticed the problems amongst the crew and alerted Worf, she even threw a Klingon out of the chair she wanted to sit in to show that she was capable of following Klingon traditions as well as those of Star Fleet... in fact I got the impression that she preferred them.

Opinions about what they should do are divided, some believe they must allow the crash to happen as 8000 people would never exist otherwise, others believe they have a duty to return to their families on DS9.This was an good episode which left the crew facing a interesting dilemma and when they must decide what to do it is surprising which people believe they should return to DS9 and those who think they have a duty to their descendants. While it was obvious that they would ultimately return to DS9 the way the ending happened came as quite a surprise which I won't spoil here.

But in this episode, there have been another 200 years (8-9 generations) with the full 8,000 person population all stemming from 40 or so people. There is just no way there would still be ""black"" & ""white"" people. (Don't even get me started on the redheads!) This would be one multi-racial group. And how there were still ""pure"" Trills, with only one to begin with, is a mystery. At the very least, the Trills would also be Klingon descendants.

As the missiles are cloaked the only way to disarm them is to go to the launch site and send the abort codes. The problem is nobody in Star Fleet knows where the base is, this means that Sisko must release the traitor Eddington and go with him to the Badlands. Here they must evade Jem'Hadar warships to get to the planet where they find that it has fallen to the Jem'Hadar already. While heading to the control centre they find a group of Marquis survivors and Eddington reveals that the message had been sent so that a mission would be dispatched and the survivors rescued and there were never any missiles.This was a gripping episode, until the end I didn't guess that the message was just a plan to get people rescued.

But with every other exchange between the Ben Sisko and Michael Eddington characters, my heart broke a little more. During the episode, it is confirmed that the Maquis (outwardly conceived as a story device for Star Trek Voyager) have been purged from their colonies on the Cardassian border. This was the last time the Maquis were mentioned during DS9, despite the Sisko character's expression of hope that several of them had survived the Dominion purge. In this writer's opinion, the Maquis were underused, and producer Ira Steven Behr's decision to terminate their involvement on DS9 is regrettable.

When the episode begins, there are indications that the Maquis are about to launch a last-ditch attack--one that will annihilate a lot of innocent Cardassians using a banned biogenic weapon. Why Sisko feels he needs to take the unrepentant Eddington out of prison to help him, I have no idea.

Garak has supposedly gone through 153 wedding dresses with Rom and Leeta. How does he know it's that many? And just how long have they been stood there? Five Hours? 3. Leeta, Rom, and Ziyal remember exactly which dress goes with which dress number. That means they know all 153 dresses that they discussed with Garak. They know it so fluently, as well. It comes as easy to them as 9 * 9 does to me. 81! There, I can do it too! Piece of cake.4. Having this wedding comedy going on at the same time as doom and destruction beckon for the Federation sets a conflicting tone in the episode. Mixing those two story lines is naive writing.5. ""That's the fifth convoy heading for Cardassia in the last five weeks"" And you have done nothing about it. Nothing at all. Talk about Adolf and the 1930s.6. Jake is a reporter, and reports on his dad. Another shoehorned storyline to give a useless character a reason to remain on the show. The whole thing is stupid anyway. Nothing has led up to this apart from some minor words and HEY PRESTO- Heeeeere's Jakey! We haven't seen any proper reporters in Trek. It hasn't been touched upon, because Gene and co eradicated this sort of thing- just like Rock music v Classical. This also brings up the whole problem with how careers would work in a moneyless society. But hell, there is enough crap here to deal with already.7. Is Sisko a genetic superhuman too? He can tell you what the 190th Ferengi Rule of Acquisition is on a whim.8. Nog is another worthless character who was given a new job to keep him on the show. Suddenly this brainless half-wit is good enough to join Starfleet. Again, it's another example of Star Trek's HEY PRESTO writing.9. Mining the entrance to the wormhole. Not a bad idea (maybe you should have started that five weeks ago?), but who have you got coming up with the method? It's Rom- another well established brain-dead character who then suddenly joined Starfleet. On one hand, acts like an idiot and, on the other, comes up with, and implements, a system of self replicating mines. And that brings up a further logical problem: This idea would have been devised a LONG time ago by somebody else. It's as if the writers thought ""Wow, good idea. How fun. Roll with it."" 10. Look at how this script: Rom: ""What if I can't make her happy!? What if this is the biggest mistake of my life!?"" O'Brien: ""ROM!"" Rom: ""...Self replication. That's the only answer."" WHAT is going on there??????????? And it doesn't stop. Go back and watch.I can do it, too: ""Balloons!"" ""E=MC2!"" 11. There is a gaping problem with the mine idea (well, several actually). Even nuclear weapons today would be able to wipe out thousands of them in one shot. And Trek weapons must be better than that, right? But again, the writers don't care, so shut off your brain, people! 12. ""You'll have to wait until the whole minefield is deployed before you can activate it."" They can't work individually? That's just nonsense. The explanation Rom gives as to why this is doesn't make any sense either. He then goes on about Leeta's clothes. This entire scene is like he's having some sort of schizophrenic breakdown. The writers want him to be a genius and a dumb-ass at the same time. Comedy has a place, but not in serious exposition of this kind. And no-one acts remotely like this unless they have a medical condition.13. DS9 would be long gone. It's right next to the wormhole and the Founders would have obliterated it. Especially given it has nothing substantial guarding it, except Starfleet's trusty ""Shields down to 10%"".14. An ambassador to the mortal enemy of Starfleet comes to discuss the minefield. A bit like that Nazi ambassador who came to discuss allied tactics with Churchill during WWII....Oh, and the ambassador knows about a minefield that hasn't even been deployed and to which there was no way an information leak could have occurred. The story doesn't even go into how he found out, because the writers didn't care about that. It's another HEY PRESTO moment.This list does go to 26.... But no space here.http://www.jammersreviews.com/st-ds9/s5/arms.php",1
0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Way of the Warrior (TV Episode 1995)","One of the ""big"" episodes of the series","The first episode of season four was a two-hour installment, bringing in Michael Dorn, reprising his Next Generation ""Worf"" character, now joining the DS9 cast. The plot itself involves a ""proactive"" strike by the Klingons against the Dominion by attacking Cardassia, much to the irritation of the Federation The show introduces J. G. Hertzler as ""Martok"" and features bug-eyed ""Gowron"" as brilliantly played by Robert O'Reilly.Andrew Robinson, as always, gets to scene-steal as the sardonic and crafty Garek. An encounter between him and some angry Klingons results in some spicy dialog uttered by the Cardassian tailor. Garek also gets to exchange ""pleasantries"" with Marc Alaimo's ""Gul Dukat"".Besides the superb acting of regular and guest cast members, the show has stunning special effects, especially the scene when the armada of Klingon ships ""de-cloak"", revealing that they surround the space station. Also, a fight between Klingons and DS9 personnel is well-choreographed Good writing, acting, and sfx makes this a landmark episode in the seven-year history of the show.",9
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Way of the Warrior (TV Episode 1995)","Finally, a reward for loyal fans, and a treat for casual SF watchers","This double-length season opener does many things well, combining some of the best elements of old-school Trek with more contemporary action sci-fi. It seems to me like a resurrection of the series, a celebration, and in some ways a reconciliation with the loyal fans who were becoming disappointed in the franchise, but who decided to give DS9 another chance.After a slew of boringly ""skippable"" episodes packing the end of the previous season, the rapid fire plot developments that fans get in this episode are refreshingly welcome. Of course, some ""slow"" Trek episodes are excellent too (a great example being the episode that follows this one), but fast, well-done *and* meaningful is worth embracing.Firstly, so many things happen in this episode that it could be overwhelming; however, it's not, thanks to the writers' compression of the dialogues into pithy character-exposing vignettes and pithy exchanges. Garak (Andrew Robinson) and Gowron (Robert O'Reilly), in particular, elevate their zingers nearly to the point of camp, but they're darned entertaining. Political discussions are kept to relevant points, and they're over before they get dreary.As for the action, there is more overall ass-kicking in this episode than perhaps in the previous three seasons combined. We can even foresee the re-thinking of action's role during the opening credits, in which the usually soporific score picks up a driving beat; the CGI artists add all sorts of things flying around, with little folks in space suits on the hull doing sparky things. As for the space battles in the episode, it seems like the CGI folks used up half a season's budget to make them happen. The station, for once, shows its teeth, and pretty much everyone gets to show off their hand-to-hand combat skills.And this is why I mentioned old-school Trek: Klingons, phasers, and fisticuffs. Didn't Roddenberry envision Trek as sort of a space western? Well, there's a good, old showdown in this episode which many Trek fans have been waiting for since the 60s. And speaking of Klingons, there are mobs of them, and as part of an apparent re-invigoration of the series, (no spoilers) a fan favorite rejoins the franchise. As for lovable villains (it's not a spoiler to mention this guy), Gowron makes a spectacularly bug-eyed, ""glorious"" appearance.The only minus that I could find in this episode, if I tried hard, would be that because of the pacing the characters come off as two-dimensional. In defense, however, for one, this is a season opener: for the sake of new viewers, a writer is often pressured to reintroduce every character in a quickly digestible manner. Secondly, this is Trek having fun, and the ""speculative fiction,"" head-scratching aspect of Trek is traditionally all about the situations, not the characters.A very satisfying episode for fans, and a totally decent watch for SF enthusiasts.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Way of the Warrior (TV Episode 1995)",The Series Hits Its Stride,"When I watch DS9 before, something came up and I stopped watching it. I wasn't driven to go back because while the third season was pretty good, it didn't grab me that intensely. This episode really brought me back into the fold. Here we are brought into a set of conflicts involving the Klingons, the Cardassians, the Bajorans, and others. The Klingons heavy handedly move into the station and begin pushing people around. They have decided to do battle with the Cardassians, assuming the Federation will join them. They seem to think that joining the Federation gives them privileges. Meanwhile there are beatings and confrontations, with Sisko having to stand up for the principles of Starfleet. The central figure that makes and impact and causes a great deal of tribulation, is our friend Worf, who served on the Enterprise with Picard. This is a sophisticated episode that follows political and philosophical motivations. Excellent.",10
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Way of the Warrior (TV Episode 1995)",Worf joins the DS9 crew,"As season four begins there is one obvious change... Sisko has shaved his head and his new appearance makes him look far more serious. When a fleet of Klingons arrives at DS9 it soon appears that they are going to illegally search any ship leaving Bajoran space in case they are transporting any founders. Needing a Klingon officer to help him deal with the local Klingons Captain Sisko contacts Star Fleet and they dispatch Lt. Commander Worf who had previously served on the Enterprise in ""The Next Generation"". His inquiries lead him to find out that the Klingons are planning to invade Cardassia, where the government has recently collapsed and the Klingons suspect Dominion involvement. Star Fleet decides not to get involved but Sisko thinks this could lead to further problems so lets Garak learn what is happening to he can warn Cardassia.This was a great introduction to season for, Michael Dorn's Worf is a welcome addition to the Deep Space Nine cast and he is thrown straight into the action and must decide whether he will side with the Klingons and Star Fleet. Even though he was only in for a little while Andrew Robinson did a great job as Garak, the high point being when, after being badly beaten by a group of Klingons, tell the doctor that he came off better as he was able to get off some particularly cutting remarks.",8
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Way of the Warrior (TV Episode 1995)",This is NOT CGI,"When I first heard about this 'sode, I thought, ""Oh, here we go, they just HAD to add Worf - They must be Slipping"". Maybe that was correct, but what happens here in THIS 'sode was just the tangent Deep Space 9 needed as a kick in the glutinous buttocks. It wasn't just the appearance of Klingons, adding a new threat to a situation that was already becoming untenable - But the producers injected the question: ""How do you deal with Klingons?"" The answer they postulated, was ""With Another KLINGON"" - And so they picked the RIGHT Klingon to do it. The Klingons harass Garak and Cassidy Yates and have some agenda that they are not talking about.WORF was, is, as Kehylar (Worf's original mate) said, ""The Perfect Klingon - The Ultimate Minimalist"" - Little did we know that Worf would save DS9. Not as a character in the series, but as a pivoting point that so many story arcs revolved around. So I am very glad Worf put on his forehead and Bat'leth once more.Of course right away we realised that eventually Worf would end up with Jadzia. It was as if, this was planned from the earliest revelations that the Dax symbiote, who was Curzon before Jadzia, knew more about Klingons than the Klingons did. Dax IS a Klingon, and the Jadzia host embraced the interest in the Klingon Culture that Curzon had developed over his lifetime. Unlike the next host Ezri, who had problems with Klingon Familiarity - Not even liking RaktajinoAnd so this 'sode is the exact middle of DS9, the Klingons break the Kitohmer accords merely as an excuse to go to WAR once again. The Klingons MUST Fight, they HAVE to provoke a situation and this is what Gowron did. Now Gowron is WITHOUT HONOUR: We put up with Gowron during TNG because Picard was his Arbiter of Succession. And perhaps Starfleet wanted to send Picard to deal with Gowron, but the Enterprise D had just been destroyed by the Tah-kecks Lursa and Be'tor! So with his succession so far in the past and the convenient lack of the Enterprise D to send, Gowron provokes this whole situation. The only thing Starfleet could have done was send Worf, there was no Enterprise E yet. And so this situation comes to a ""Klingon Forehead"", and Worf comes to DS9 as does General Martok - Who we find out later, is not quite Martok- who seems to be blindly following Gowron into the blazes of battle. And it is WORF who sacrifices his honour, ONCE AGAIN, ""For the Good of the Empire"" - Because he will NOT follow Gowron blindly like a Targ.The last portion of this 'sode has the best up to this point space battle ever filmed for a TV show - THIS IS NOT CGI! This was major... The Trek effects department overextended themselves to give us this gift. Although WAR was never in Gene's canon for Trek, the DS9 production crew had to give us this scenario. WHAT IF the Klingons were to invade a Federation-Held Territory- what would that look like? How would the Federation DEAL with it? So many beautiful Klingon ships, destroyed. DS9 special effects later used the same technique in several battles including Federation Starships, Cardassian Cruisers, Klingon Birds of Prey, and Jem'Hadar warships (which looked like beetles). So this Klingon Attack on DS9 was the first of many scenes in DS9 that mimicked and homaged ""Victory at Sea"" - The award winning commentary and documentary of WW-II Naval Battles. And since the Federation Command Structure is Maritime, it is a very apt homage.This is the battle that SHOULD have been shown in ""Best of Both Worlds"" which we did not get to see in TNG at any time. ONLY in Deep Space 9 could we go just beyond the borders of Roddenberry, to see what these battles looked like, and so, in The Emissary, we get a SMALL Taste of WOLF 359... But in Way of the Warrior, we get to see the whole thing.So watch this ep as the Klingons Attack DS9. In ""The Emissary"" Sisko creates an illusion of armaments on the station made of ""Thoron Fields and Duranium Shadows"" - But in THIS 'sode-- It is no illusion, much to the chagrin of the Klingon Fleet of Vor'cha class cruisers and Birds of Prey and even the Old Style TOS Klingon Battle Cruisers. Gowron has a bitchin new Battle Cruiser... When the Photon Launchers and Phaser emitters rise from the upper pylons of DS9 it's ""Where did those come from!"" - Well that PA'TAK Gowron finds out, doesn't he? And the Trek crew of extras and stuntees must have had a blast... We get to see Worf and Sisko handling Bat'leths and Mek'leths and there are phaser and disrupter blasts galore... Too bad nobody was ""waporised"" (As Chekov would have put it).Initially, this 'sode seems to veer away from the Founders/Dominion story arc - But as we watch the subsequent seasons of DS9 - The Involvement of The Founders becomes apparent.Enjoy this 'Sode, I certainly did! DS9 was probably the last show ever not to use CGI in humongous space battles, and it paid off in full.",10
5,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Way of the Warrior (TV Episode 1995)",Lots of stuff happenin' here--though I didn't think it was always logical.,"This is a double-length episode and like many of these lengthy episodes and season openers, LOTS of stuff is happening! The biggest change is Worf becoming a regular on ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" but Captain Sisko is now bald and once again pretty much ignores his commanding officers' orders. This isn't new but is at least the third time Sisko gets away with this!The show begins with Worf begin transferred, at least temporarily, to DS9 because some problems are now brewing with the Klingons around the wormhole. They have arrived en masse on the station and they are in a VERY argumentative mood. Why all the posturing and anger on the part of the Klingons? What is their goal? And how does this all fit into the wicked Founders' plans?This show is decent because LOTS happens and there is lots of action. On the other hand, the show is NOT especially logical and Sisko's intervention in the Cardassian-Klingon war makes little sense--nor does his risking everything to save Dukat and the Cardassian council. Sitting back and just letting things take their course would have made a lot more sense. Plus, how is it that Sisko wasn't taken up on charges for his latest insubordination?!By the way, in a tiny role aboard the Defiant you see Patricia Tallman--the same lady who would begin playing Lyta the telepath on ""Babylon 5""this same year. Several other Trek actors would also appear on ""Babylon 5"" and vice-versa over the years, such as Andreas Katsulas playing a recurring role as a Cardassian on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" as well as a regular role on ""Babylon 5"". So, for fans of both franchises, this is a particularly noteworthy episode.",8
0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Visitor (TV Episode 1995)",One of television's finest hours,"I met Tony Todd at a horror film convention yesterday. On the way there I decided that if he wasn't too busy I was going to tell him that of all the good, great, or terrible things he's been in, this single episode of Deep Space Nine is my most favorite. This episode made me cry like a baby. I only saw it once, back when it originally aired, but I still get choked up thinking about it twelve years later. I never knew my father and this story made me feel how acutely that absence has impacted my life. Silly, I know. But that's the true power of art; and yes, sometimes television is art.I didn't know if he would even remember being in it. I didn't know if it meant as much to him as it did to me. I didn't know if he would smirk at my trek-geekiness.When I stepped up to select a picture for him to autograph, I noticed one of the pictures was from an episode of Voyager that I'd forgotten he was in. He asked if I liked Star Trek and I admitted that I did.Then he said ""Have you seen The Visitor?"" I won't go into details because they're not mine to share, but as he explained his personal connection to the story, I realized that this episode may actually mean more to him than it does to me. And it means an awful lot to me.If you watch only one episode of any Star Trek series ever, make it this one.",10
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Visitor (TV Episode 1995)",One of the best of all episodes...,"A heart-wrenching, tear-jerking, performance driven episode that will not easily fade away from anyone's heart... Father-son relationship... It's just so good. I can explain the story and how it unfolds, but it's just not the same as viewing it. This episode is so wonderfully written and has such poignant, moving details that it soars to new heights of storytelling. Through this, we see many new things about Sisko and Jake--about their lives and their relationship. Above all, this episode stresses the bond between a father and a son, and contains family issues that many people can relate to.Michael Taylor has delivered one of the series' best stories, and David Livingston's direction is stunning, stellar execution. As I said before, the flashback elements are wonderfully done and the performances are about as perfect as they could be. The editing and music is all in place, causing scenes to flow terrifically together. Even if you're grabbing the tissues by the end of this episode (I was) there is no way you can call this story maudlin or melodramatic. It's completely absorbing from the first frame to the last; definitely one of DS9's finest moments. There is true magic working here.",
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Visitor (TV Episode 1995)",The Dangers of Obsession,"For those reviewers who are confused as to why this episode is beloved by so many (myself included), it is because it touches us so deeply. While several people point out that ""future Jake"" becomes so out-of-character from the character depicted on the series, what you are seeing is the effects of a Jake growing up without his father's guidance, and immense guilt over his father's accident. Obviously that experience, and him being part of it, changes the character in very dramatic ways.Ultimately, the story becomes one of loss and obsession. Once Jake realizes his father isn't dead and *may* be retrievable, he becomes a man obsessed to the point that everything else in his life falls apart: loves, friendships, career, etc. Jake's obsession basically destroys the promising life he had before him, and Tony Todd gives perhaps his best performance ever in depicting this. Although the ending resolves the conflict, this alternate timeline tells us so much more of the importance of Jake's relationship with his father than any other episode had to date. And ultimately, to see Ben's sadness at what his son's life had become because of the obsession...truly touching. The best stories in Star Trek are by far those that deal with relationships, and this is one of the top 5 in Trek cannon IMHO (""City on the Edge of Forever"" from TOS being number one).",10
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Visitor (TV Episode 1995)","The Best Of A Series, Among The Best Of A Franchise","Tonight, reviewing the episode history of Deep Space Nine, I was drawn to this episode because I remember it being the first time that a Deep Space Nine episode left me breathless and totally gobsmacked by such a perfect match of excellent performance and excellent writing.I'm not surprised to find myself in agreement with the reviewers here who utterly loved the episode. Tony Todd was a crucial part of one of my all-time favorite Next Generation episodes, where his Klingon captain reveals his brotherhood to Worf and urges him to claim the family birthright, only to have politics force Worf into banishment. Here, watching Mr Todd, you can plainly see that the material IS HIS, it's a masterful, deep and touching, even stunning performance.This Star Trek franchise has never gotten its due in my opinion. As a followup to the rightly successful Next Generation, it lived in the syndication shadows for most of its life, and unlike Next Generation which evolved from a mediocre start to an excellent middle and old age, Deep Space Nine was a non-stop victory lap for Star Trek IMO, even its least popular episodes were GOOD.Over all five ST franchises, there are a dozen episodes that hit me in the gut, and six of them are DS9 episodes. I live near Mt Rushmore, where (last time I checked) Avery Brooks' voice narrates the nightly video shown during the lighting ceremony at dusk. I feel the need to head out there again.",
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Visitor (TV Episode 1995)",Stunning,"Love this show and am a big fan of both Avery Brooks and Tony Todd. Since Tony's introduction to Star Trek in Next Generation's 'Sins of The Father', I've loved his work. Sisko's relationship with his son was a truly brilliant piece of both acting and character development throughout the entire series. Never in watching Trek have I been moved to tears until watching this. Some of the scenes between Ben and Jake are truly heart wrenching. The time shifting was handled well and both leads are truly stunning. DS9 has rarely been this good. Tony's emulation of Cirroc Lofton's Jake in older guise is terrific. One episode to keep you glued to the screen from start to finish",10
5,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Visitor (TV Episode 1995)",The one about fathers and sons...,"'The Visitor'~ Season four, episode two.This episode explores the love and devotion between Jake Sisko and his father when an accident occurs which sees Ben Sisko being lost in time. As Jake, now all but orphaned, struggles to cope, Sisko re-appears and continues to do so through his son's life. Sisko remains unchanged but Jake grows up and enters adulthood, becoming an obsessive man who is unable to let his father go and is determined to bring him back whatever the cost.This is a truly poignant episode that wonderfully depicts the bond between Ben and Jake Sisko, all the more touching because relationships between parent and child depicted in Trek are often shown to be turbulent and fractious (Picard, Riker, Bashir, Paris, Torres, Chakotay, Ezri Dax and Spock, to a degree, are such characters that this is a trend in). Cirroc Lofton and Tony Todd do an excellent job of portraying Jake through various points of his life, both as a grief-stricken teenage boy and as a single-minded, intense man who is unwilling to give up on his father. They interact well with Avery Brooks' Ben Sisko, as the father who is forced to watch Jake grow up without him and eventually realises just how far his son will go to save him. The very down-to-earth, human aspect to Jake is apparent in this episode and it is all the more clear why he always a Trek child who viewers could tolerate and identify with far more than the irritatingly perfect Wesley Crusher. 'The Visitor' is an episode which proves DS9 can do heavy emotional story lines with a flare often just associated with Patrick Stewart's Picard.",9
6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Visitor (TV Episode 1995)","What a wonderful, wonderful story!","Deep Space Nine, an excellent and powerful series in its own right, absolutely outdid itself in this episode. This is not only GREAT science fiction, it is astoundingly good visual storytelling and acting. If you only ever watch one episode of any season of Star Trek, watch this episode. It is positively masterful. The characters in the series I already love outdid themselves, and grew to something more personal and touching than I was ever aware could happen between myself and television. I have never been so moved and drawn into a tragedy, so tormented and enlightened, so joyous and amazed. What a wonderful, wonderful story.",10

I have a great relationship with my father and yet it still hit me as hard as those with father issues.I'm usually a hater of the ""human interest"" Star Trek episodes because they usually are just treading water until the producers can get enough budget for a good episode. THIS IS AN EXCEPTION.I bought the season four DVD just so I could have this episode and share it with my own son.Also, this would be a great episode to get your lady friend interested in the Star Trek franchise.",10
8,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Visitor (TV Episode 1995)",Phenomenal,"In my endeavor to re-watch the entirety of all three Start Trek series (TNG, DS9 and VGR), this one episode stands out in its refinement, sensitivity, emotional delivery, and substance. Philosophically it is up there with ""Tapestry"" from TNG, but stylistically flows a lot better. The storytelling, mood, and delivery are in the realm of art. I was amazed this was television. Flawless and exceptional performances.The story explores a parental bond that stands the tests of time; genuine and resonant. Brooks', Todd's, and Lofton's performance is so authentic and personable; it generates a lake of emotion that by induction we find our own inner world sway and careen in synchronicity with uncanny levels of fidelity. Rarely a story can deliver its message more accurately. It is probably what a Vulcan mind melt must feel like.",
9,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Visitor (TV Episode 1995)",It doesn't get any better than this,"Like so many of the previous reviewers, I find this episode to be among the best of any in the entire Trek franchise ... and more, simply one of the best episodes of any TV show, any genre, over time. And I'm frankly bewildered by the couple of negative reviewers who seem unable to empathize with the quiet power & beauty of this deeply moving father-son story.If you're reading these reviews, you already know the basic plot: young Jake Sisko loses his father in a bizarre accident that strands Benjamin Sisko in a timeless limbo, from which he emerges for a brief moment every so often over Jake's lifetime. The plot mechanics of this are unimportant -- what matters is the human story of a son losing his father, yearning for his presence, never quite whole because of that loss, and struggling to cope with it & set it right.I just watched it again last night, which makes it at least a dozen times since it first aired. My father was alive then; he died a few years later. So the wrenching emotional punch of this story has only grown over time for me ... and, I suspect, for the vast majority of those who have also watched it. Were there tears streaming down my face by the end, this time around? Oh, yes. Anyone who loved & lost their father understands.Next Generation justly takes pride in ""The Inner Light"" -- but ""The Visitor"" is easily its equal, and in many ways even more meaningful & rich. I'll definitely be watching it many more times to come in the future.",10
10,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Visitor (TV Episode 1995)",A heart wrenching must see episode of television excellence,"I've recently been re-watching all of DS9 from scratch and was working my way up to this episode, an episode I knew I was very much looking forward to watching again.Now normally I'm not a fan of what you might call the 'filler' episodes you get in Star Trek, you know nothing especially exciting happens its usually some basic moral story cause the writers were having a lazy week blah blah yawn.The very first time I saw this episode I got that impression from the first few seconds that this might be a filler episode so wasn't that excited... but then I watched, and kept watching, and became glued to the screen and so emotionally involved. By the end of it I had tears streaming down by face.There's a good reason why this particular episode of DS9 has so many reviews of it, because it really is THAT special, not just for DS9, but any television show ever made. It's such an incredibly moving script about the love between father and son that it seems to have elevated everyones A-game. The directing the acting cinematography, even music, the music especially felt far more raw and emotional than any episode before. I think everyone working on this particular one felt truly inspired by it.But especially the acting by Avery Brooks, Cirroc Lofton and Tony Tood just killed me. It's like they all drew from some deep personal experiences to deliver those performances. Just wow, honestly, if there's one episode of DS9 that is not to be missed, it is this one.If one really had to nit-pick, you could argue the older Nog wasn't so great, but it doesn't matter. Watching it again after all these years it still brought me to tears, and for it to move me that much emotionally and really cut right through me....deserves a 10/10 from me.",10
11,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Visitor (TV Episode 1995)",A beautifully directed story from DS9,"I am crying like a baby. This is an incredible episode and I'm sure my relating to Jake in the story helped to make me feel so connection. I was taken back by the wonderful story and direction of the episode. Appropriate, heart aching/warming and great. Father-Son connection at it's best.*Some spoilers* There is a part in the episode that sticks with me and it isn't necessarily the end, but some of the life choices Jake has to make through his life holding onto a piece of himself he was never able to let go and reconcile with. If there is one thing to do when watching is knowing this may seem like a filler episode, however it is a refreshing sad and heartwarming story from a series that started really bad and came such a long way by season 4. Worth watching",10
12,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Visitor (TV Episode 1995)",Why Captain Sisko is needed on DS9,"This episode is very different to other episodes of Deep Space Nine; it opens with a young woman paying a visit to an old man living in Louisiana, it turns out that he is an old Jake Sisko and she wants to know why he stopped writing. We see flashbacks of his life, starting at the day he lost his father in an accident in the Gamma Quadrant. He isn't dead though, merely caught in subspace and every so often he reappears in Jakes life for a few minutes, unlike everybody else however he is always the same age he was at the time of the accident. Jake can never really get over the loss and while he did write two successful books his main purpose in life was trying to get his father back. We learn that things soon changed on DS9, the Bajorans returned home and formed an alliance with the Cardassians and the Klingons are now running the station. Fifty years after the event that caused his father to be lost Jake reassembles the old crew and they take the Defiant through the worm hole to recreate the accident. Eventually Jake realises that there is only one way he can save his father... he must die while his father is with him so that he can return to the moment of the accident and thus prevent it.I thought this was a decent episode and Tony ""Candyman"" Todd did a good job as the adult Jake Sisko. The story was goods enough although I didn't find the regular cast, apart from Nog, convincing when they played themselves decades into the future. I was pleased with the way it was made clear that it was Captain Sisko's disappearance that led the later situation of DS9 so future episodes will not have to follow the future shown here.",7

I think genuine emotions should carry a lot of weight, but to capture its gravity one must see its connection to real life, not one specific, GREEEEAAAAT event. It must be seen through the mundane and the subtle, not lengthy speech. DIS failed, because it brought all emotions outside the skull, showing us too much loud love confessions and tears, so what should be moving, becomes smothering.Star Trek deserves better. Yeah, sure, this episode is proof that it has provided better. A man's whole life in three quarter hours? How is that possible?--Yeah, it is, when his whole life was just about one agenda, and all the heavy decisions he's made were about it.What would you feel if you have lost a loved one? Surely you would grieve, but in time you would get over it. That is the normal case. But what if you know who's gone is never really gone, and there is a possible way to save him, albeit it would take a lifetime? Your hope will hinge on this unlikely solution, which forbade you the ability to forget and move on.You are here, living, your love is gone, but somehow he still lives, and you know there exists a constant tether between you that transcends time and space. I say this is bad, far worse than death, because the fear of loss is so much crueler than loss itself. If you are ever to miss the chance to reclaim what's yours, you will live a life's regret. The prospect of that possibility constantly terrorizes you.This episode is no space drama, change the basic settings and it would have worked in any franchise, because human sentiments are universal. We earned a chance to see a developing character at his fullest, whose capacity to love allowed him to look beyond life and death.I did not cry, because I don't cry when watching TV.

Instead, I thought it was slow and boring.However, ""The Visitor"" isn't an action-packed episode. It is about Jake's love for his father and how far Jake would go for him.

As a boy who's butt heads with Weyoun more than once and fought against Jem'Hadar soldiers, you'd expect him not to be such a crazy guy who just can't get over his obsession, even after his father requests him to.This episode always struck me as a season filler, one of the bad episodes that were made so that a full season could be made.

22,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Visitor (TV Episode 1995)",Good but it's one that does NOT improve with repeated viewing.,"""The Visitor"" is a very, very good episode of ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"". However, unlike a typical episode, if you re-watch it years later, it really doesn't hold up so well. You cannot blame the show for this--it's just that MUCH of what you see in this one of the future are things you KNOW cannot take place--such as the presence of Jadzia Dax or the continued adversarial relationship with the Dominion. When the show begins, Jake Sisko witnesses his father disappearing due to a warp core accident. Then, the rest of the show is set much later--showing Jake as he ages (played by Tony Todd). And, how the future CAN be changed. But as I alluded to above, people who re-watch it will quickly realize that this future could NOT take place--so the ending comes as no big surprise. Still, Todd is a wonderful actor with a melodious voice--and seeing him in the show was quite nice. And, the material really is very emotionally charged and you might just find yourself shedding a tear or two as the program progresses.",9
23,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Visitor (TV Episode 1995)",Stuck in time,"This DS9 episode has a simple and powerful story that most people can connect to: Jake Sisko ""lost"" his father in an accident and he's wasting his life trying to get him back. I can see why it's highly rated by most of the other reviewers, because it addresses the loss of a dear family member, an event that leaves people with wounds that can be very difficult to heal.Apart from that, I am as shocked as others when seeing people comparing it to Star Trek TNG's ""Inner Light"" in terms of quality and emotional impact, or stating that they were brought to tears by this. I hate to sound cold hearted about it - considering that 'Inner Light' moves me to tears every freaking time I watch it - but this is nowhere that level, and I'll try to explain why.First of all, it's not the story of an episode that makes the episode great, it's HOW that story is written, produced and acted - basically how it's incorporated into the episode - that does the trick. You can have a simpleton story like the one in 'Groundhog Day' and make it great by producing it right, or you can have a great story that fails because it isn't efficiently ""told"" in the film. This episode belongs to the latter - apart from the clear feeling that it's a 'filler' episode with no connection to the story arc whatsoever, the fact that it's narrated by the aging Jake instead of being described by his actual life events makes it dull, almost boring, lacking any kind of potential dynamics associated with a person's life.Secondly, the acting (or, if you like, what the actors were told to do) is atrocious, really. This is a recurring issue in DS9, where apart from the actors playing Kai Winn, Garak, Gul Dukat and maybe Kira Nerys or Odo characters, there aren't any special talents put to work in that aspect. Avery Brooks (the actor playing Sisko), for example, might be ideal for shouting/barking orders in a war-like scenario, but is seriously lacking when pursuing more dramatic parts of his role, like this one. Same for the actor playing Jake Sisko, who might be great at playing picking up girls or ""hanging out"" with his father or Nog, but he's just not suited for deeper episode like this one. Another issue in this episode in particular is that there is just WAY TOO MUCH WEEPING, period. The key in having a great dramatic episode is not to make the characters cry every freaking time they mention their father's name, but to make THE VIEWERS do it. 'Inner Light' actors, for example, hardly shed any tears in their performance, but stole a lot from the viewers (myself included) - and that's one example of many. Unfortunately, this episode not only didn't stole a single tear from me, but it hardly kept me interested in it.Lastly, this episode failed to have any impact on me (and others as well, it seems), because, as someone else said, Jake is simply out of character. Not only because of his role as a regular teenager with other more important interests than hanging out with his father, but also because the charater is a secondary (I'm being gentle here) one. The viewers hardly got any chance to really connect with and care for the character, and even if they somehow did, it's hard to imagine a boy who has the most fun playing dom-jot, dating Dabo girls and playing tricks on people along with Nog ending up wasting his ENTIRE life pathetically crying and feeling sorry for himself, or even trying to bring his father back because ""it was his fault"" (really?) that he lost him. It just isn't consistent with such a light-hearted character as Jake is - plain and simple.All in all, this is an episode that relies too much on having an impact on viewers by overcrying and reminding them of their OWN personal experiences and too less on having that impact by good acting, making the story believable and caring for / relating with the actual characters. But then, what can I say? For some people, it works, for others it doesn't. The first season's ""Duet"" seemed like a much better made episode than this one, although this one had clearly so much more potential to be truly great. The difference between this episode's potential and what actually came out of it is basically why I rated it this low.",4

0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Hippocratic Oath (TV Episode 1995)",The one where Bashir is conflicted between being a doctor and being a Starfleet officer...,"'Hippocratic Oath'Season four, episode fourI was about thirteen when I saw my first episode of DS9 and I'm rather ashamed to admit Bashir was my favourite character mainly because he was the only young reasonably attractive male in the cast. Thankfully, I quickly outgrew this shallow behaviour and, in turn, found Bashir's arrogant boyishness quite irritating in the first couple of seasons where he was portrayed to be much like a hyperactive puppy the others had to rein in. However, mid-way through the series, the character began to change, becoming far more interesting in his own right proving the DS9 scriptwriters had a talent for delivering character development. 'Hippocratic Oath' is a hallmark episode in the character's progress from moving away from being the fresh-faced kid of the main cast.The episode sees Bashir and O'Brien crash-landing on a planet in the Gamma Quadrant where they are captured by a group of renegade Jem'Hadar who need a doctor to produce them more Ketracel White, the drug their bodies have been engineered to need for survive. But while O'Brien wants nothing more than to leave the Jem'Hadar to their inevitable painful deaths, Bashir feels that his duties as a doctor means he is obliged to help them.This is a great episode in terms of character development and in excellent Star Trek storytelling where Starfleet officers are caught between doing what is right and their human impulses for revenge. It portrays the chalk-and-cheese friendship between the hardened, war veteran O'Brien, who is falling back into soldier mode as war between the Founders and Federation looks imminent, and the more idealistic, benevolent qualities that contribute to making Bashir a good doctor, who is torn between the Hippocratic Oath and the truth that the Jem'Hadar are a deadly race.",9

2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Hippocratic Oath (TV Episode 1995)",A question of morality,"When Dr. Bashir and Chief O'Brien investigate a reading which suggests there may be a crashed ship on a nearby planet in the Gamma Quadrant they find themselves pulled down to the surface where they find themselves prisoners of the Jen'Hadar. These aren't normal Jen'Hadar though, their leader has overcome his addiction to the drug used to control them and is convinced the answer to how he overcame that addiction is to be found on this planet. He asks the doctor to help him find the cure and he agrees both because it is his duty as a doctor to help the sick and also because he believes freeing the Jem'Hadar from their addiction will weaken the Dominion. Chief O'Brien sees things differently however and believes finding a cure would be aiding the enemy and that a Jem'Hadar free of Dominion control could be even more dangerous. Meanwhile back on DS9 Worf is unimpressed with Odo's failure to arrest Quark who is involved in an obvious smuggling deal, despite being told to leave security matters to Odo he attempts to stop the crime and in doing so spoils Odo's plans to find the people higher up the chain.This was a fairly good episode which saw Bashir and O'Brien's friendship tested when they had opposite opinions on what their duty was. The issues were well handled and gave us a satisfactory ending where it was made clear that both thought their friendship would survive. The secondary story was also pretty good, showing Worf that he needs to realise he is no longer a security officer and that Odo is very capable in that job.",8

It also marks an apparent attempt to soften Major Kira, as Nana Visitor underwent some sort of makeover that seemed to feminize and soften her character a bit.When the episode begins, Dr. Bashir and Miles O'Brien are on a mission using the runabout. Interestingly, Miles tells the Doctor that he sometimes wishes Keiko was a man...when the ship is suddenly diverted by what might be a ship in peril. Unfortunately for their bromance, the pair are suddenly taken prisoner by Jem'Hadar soldiers--and many of them seem very content with just executing them. However, their commander isn't so hasty--he NEEDS the Doctor's help. It seems that these super-soldiers CAN exist without the drug given to them by the Founders--or, at least, HE can survive without it. What makes this possible is what he wants to know and he's willing to possibly let the Doctor live if he can unlock this secret. Surprisingly, the Jem'Hadar actually DON'T want to serve the Founders--but without the drug they seem to be unable to say no.This episode brings up a HUGE problem. As a doctor, Bashir cannot just ignore the Jem'Hadar's predicament. But, as a member of Starfleet, he really should NOT be helping. As for O'Brien--he has complete clarity and this clarity brings these super-friends into conflict with each other.In addition to this plot, there is a lesser plot involving Worf--who behaves like a total idiot. While he is NOT in charge of security, he seems to think that Odo doesn't know how to do his job!Overall, a pretty good episode with an interesting predicament. Worth seeing.",8

Bashir and O'Brien would normally have been disintegrated immediately if they didn't provide something of value to these guys. Perhaps the Jen'Hadar should have sought out scientific help from some friendly (to them) agency. Some seem to think that Bashir has a moral duty to give up his life to save another one. Nowhere in the Hippocratic Oath is a doctor expected to do such a thing. We knew what the fate of the Federation men would be right from the start. Yes, O'Brien is a bit of a macho man, but he has a family and a pact with the Federation. If reality were consistent in this series, Bashir would have been dead numerous episodes ago.

Back on DS9 their is a secondary story concerning Captain Sisko's potential girl friend has been offered a job on Bajor and might be moving on to the station... until his response isn't quite as enthusiastic as she would have liked.I really liked the main story, Dukat's determination of find and kill his daughter reminded me of the John Wayne classic ""The Searchers"" even if the motivations are different. Nana Visitor and Marc Alaimo do well as Kira and Dukat; while the characters don't like each other the actors work well as the two antagonists.

In my opinion episodes in this vein were what made DS9 great; rather than moving on to new problems every week like the crew of a starship, the characters and their cultures actually had to live with consequences of the past. This episode in particular does a great job of complicating Gul Dukat (and helps makes it especially annoying for the viewer when they turn him into a cartoon villain in the 6th season); by the end any viewer's opinion of him will drastically have changed. The episode is entirely driven by character development; there's no action and only one moment of real suspense (another reviewer criticized how easily they infiltrate the compound, but I'd argue this is actually a strength of the episode - with only so much airtime to work with they decided to focus exclusively on the characters rather than show a pointless ""gotta fool the bad guys"" sequence). Not to mention this is another Major Kira-centric episode, which at this point in the series is always a good thing.The B-plot has some minor character development for Sisko and is pleasant enough but doesn't really add much (but it doesn't get in the way of the A-plot either).",10

However, Dukat hides a secret--he wants to find the shuttle survivors because one could be his illegitimate daughter--one he fathered with a Bajoran! The Major, on the other hand, worries that Dukat might try to kill the girl in order to hide evidence of his indiscretions. This was a decent episode and establishing Dukat's predilection towards Bajorans will turn out to be very important later in the series. However, my problem with the show is that it was just too darn easy to infiltrate the complex in which the survivors were being held prisoner--way, way too easy.

In Trill society it is strictly taboo for new hosts to get involved if the symbionts have been married before. When they meet it is clear that they still have strong feelings for each other and Jadzia considers starting a new relationship with former wife Lenara even though it would mean exile from Trill and thus no new host for Dax when Jadzia dies. While the episode is overwhelmingly concerned with Trill prejudice about new hosts getting involved with spouses of former hosts there is some excitement when the experiment goes slightly wrong and Jadzia must attempt to save Lenara.While the episode was ostensibly about Trill prejudices they were clearly a metaphor for our own prejudices about other peoples choice in partners. This is done well by showing Jadzia in a relationship with another woman where nobody thinks anything about the fact that they are both women, clearly the creators wanted to show that this was perfectly natural and didn't need commenting on; now that seems fairly obvious but when this was new the idea of having two women sharing a passionate kiss was rather radical.

I think if you put it in context, this criticism is a bit unfair. After all, the show did feature some amazingly passionate kissing between the two female leads--more passionate than you'd normally find between heterosexual couples. Perhaps their dissatisfaction is because like too many plots, the subject is really not followed up on in any way. I can understand this--but the show STILL will likely shock a few in its depictions of homosexuality. Very interesting to say the least.",7
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Rejoined (TV Episode 1995)",DS9 never seemed to quite know what to do with Trills,"One of the oddities of this series is that the writers/creators managed to introduce a truly interesting concept, the Trill/symbiote relationship, but never seemed to be able to explore it in a particularly interesting fashion. Instead, we're given a slightly bland character (Jadzia never seemed to show any real nuance other than being a very attractive woman who was good at her job and was willing to slum it on occasion) with vaguely soap opera-ish storylines. This was a disservice to the inherent potential of the character because the concept practically screamed ""hidden depths."" While this was not the worst use of this tendency toward soap opera (that would be her ridiculous willingness to throw everything away for a man she barely knew on a transdimensional planet) but it hardly makes her character arc as interesting as those of the other credited leads on the show. Granted, there was some consistency -- she was willing to kill her symbiote permanently for an ex- she seemed to be fond of. But there was really no reason given that made the entire fatalism credible. Nothing in the series or in this particular episode suggested any reason her passion for this particular ex- was so overwhelming as to lead to such an end, and, ultimately, this episode, like the aforementioned transdimensional planet one, was vaguely insulting to the character. They had this concept with such enormous potential and spend much of their time making her an irrational and shallow creature. We should expect better from a Star Trek series.Incidentally, the whole ""exile from Trill, permanent death of symbiote"" plotline was simply ludicrous in light of everything we've been told about the Trill and their adulation of the symbiote. They don't want to encourage the symbiotes to fall back into old patterns. I get that. But presenting it as a reason to kill off a symbiote when they clearly revere symbiotes is irrational in the extreme. Discouraging such relationships, making it difficult and outright unpleasant for joined Trills to engage in them? That makes sense. But killing them off permanently for such an indiscretion? Ridiculous. The relationship wouldn't be causing actual harm, and the society would not be in danger because of them. It's very much throwing the baby out with the bathwater, and doesn't fit in with anything we've been told about Trill society and its relationship with the symbiotes. This particular plotline therefore sounds incredibly contrived just to give the episode a source of tension. It's just bad writing and someone should have said something when the story was pitched. A good writer could have introduced the idea as simply something that was actively discouraged and had social repercussions without diminishing the resultant tension.",6

From that point on it gets all soap opera on us. I understand that we need to see the implications of these relationships, but it's just so strange. By the way, the homosexual angle never occurred to me, other than the kiss, which probably was rather novel. It was the husband in Jedzia's body, not another woman.",7

Then Quark fixes them, and despite Nog's warnings, proceeds to screw around, looking for business opportunities in selling technology to the Americans.But then Odo appears~! Turns out he hid on their ship, then morphed into a dog before ambushing Quark and placing him under arrest for smuggling stuff on his transport. Quark and his Ferengi antics lead to far more problems than them simply returning easily, as he seeks to financially dominate Earth and bring Warp technology to the Ferengi centuries before any other species.Humor and spiffy character development ensues.As an added bit of continuity nodding, a special treat that serves no real purpose except to show how much smarter and witty the DS9 crew is compared to the Voyager crew; While looking through Earth history briefly, Nog finds a picture of Gabriel Bell, famous for the Bell Riots, and shows Quark, noting how Gabriel Bell looks exactly like Captain Sisko, which is exactly who it is---a nod to a previous DS9 episode where Sisko ended up forced to take Bell's place in 2024 to instigate the Bell Riots.",10

However, instead of just sending him on a transport, Quark volunteers to take him in his new space craft. Is this some sort of big-hearted gesture on Quark's part? Nah...he just wants to use this as an opportunity to do some good old fashioned smuggling! However, the plan goes awry when the ship turns out to be booby-trapped and the only reason they aren't killed is due to Rom's quick thinking. However, while the ship DOES make it back to Earth, it's Earth circa 1947! And, it just so happens to be at Roswell!! Yep...these Ferengi are the mythical 'little green men' that supposedly were taken into military custody back in the day!This show is jam-packed full of laughs from start to finish. It also FINALLY explained how everyone knows what the others are saying, as the folks in the future apparently have universal translators installed in their ears.

Quark has acquired a new ship and thinks Nog's trip to Earth to attend Star Fleet Academy will be the ideal time to test it, especially if he can sell some contraband on the way back. Unfortunately the ship has been sabotaged and Rom's attempt to stop them being destroyed throws them in to the past. When they wake up they find themselves captive in a US air base in Roswell in 1947. At first they can't communicate with their captors as their universal translators are malfunctioning due to radiation from recent A-bomb tests. Once they have fixed the translators Quark tries to make a fast buck selling 24th Century equipment to the US military, they however are very suspicious of the three Ferengis' motives. It turns out the Ferengis aren't the only ones there from the 24th Century; Odo was on their ship too as he was sure Quark was up to no good.This episode was a lot of fun, Quark's reaction to everybody smoking was great, ""If these people will pay to poison themselves they'll buy anything"". It think this was a better than average Ferengi episode as it only featured the regular characters rather than having characters like the Grand Negus feature. Interestingly the paranoid military personnel of 1947 seemed more alien than the Ferengis, although the keenness of one of the military to resort to torture seemed to predict behaviour that was unthinkable when the episode was made but happened less than ten years later.",9
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Little Green Men (TV Episode 1995)",One of the best...,"I've often despaired a little at Deep Space Nine. It often maintained a fairly bland story without enough key episodes to get your blood going but I have to admit I've always enjoyed the Ferengi episodes.Its a very old story of wily cop (Odo) vs lovable rogue (quark) and both actors clearly enjoy playing it to the full. Its Armin Shimmerman as Quark who raises the.bar on character acting though. He plays Quark as a floored career swindler who is cursed with a moral centre. He hates the fact he can't be as ruthless as other Ferengi and we love him for it.Throwing these characters up against 1950 America really brings home some resonant messages. The Ferengi as a race are vile profiteers who'll stop at nothing for some gold pressed latinum but even Quark is horrified when he realises ""they irradiated they're own atmosphere!! They're insane!"". Time travel plots can be very clunky. See ""times arrow"" in TNG for how not to do it but get the right characters and set them against the right time period and your onto a winner.This is also an episode that will please trekies and non-trekies alike. Highly recommended watching.",

Unfortunately, the ship has been sabotaged and in trying to save it, Rom inadvertently sends them back to Roswell in 1947. It's all great fun and the Ferengi observations about 20th century human behavior are both pertinent and funny. Quark sees wonderful business opportunities as humans are crude and greedy but his plans go awry. Rightly suspecting that Quark was using the trip to smuggle contraband, Odo hid himself aboard the ship. Fortunately, a couple of the humans come to their aid when one of the soldiers resorts to torture (this was the one distressing bit of the episode). Interesting that Rom who in an early episode Odo referred to as being so dumb that he couldn't unbend a straw now has become quite the rocket scientist.

The Ferengi had a rather uninspiring debut in Trek, the TNG Episode ""The Last Outpost"" and I doubt much would have been mentioned if that was their last episode also. In DS9 however they really come to life Quark and Nog being two of my favourite characters.I do not wish to give too much away other than recommending watching the episode, even if you are not a DS9 fan, the only thing I would say is prepare for the line ""We're helpless, we're harmless we just wanna sell you things!"".Take 45 minutes out your life, you will never get it back...not even if someone offered you 100 bars of gold-pressed latinum for it!",10

So far, a nice idea, and kudos to the designers for an absolutely magnificent ""first bat'leth"" - no kidding.What follows though is not that smart though. Apparently the writers wanted the major symbolism of the sword in Klingon culture to be a dangerous thing that generates conflict between any Klingons that get a hand on the sword, and were baffled by the fact that the viewers thought the sword was either carrying a ""virus"" or had some ""magical powers"" that caused the whole aggresive behavior. Ok, maybe most viewers don't bother that much to get the underlying message of an episode, but then, what do you expect if you - aka the writers - don't explain things properly (not to mention that the strange behavior is simply illogical even for the brutal Klingon culture)?If the sword was such a cause of conflict between Klingons, why on Earth (pardon, Qo'onos - the Klingon homeworld) was it just a harmless artifact that caused unity among Klingons before it was stolen by the Hur'q invaders? Sorry to say this, but the writers' idea to make the sword provoke division was pointless and absurd, really. No wonder the viewers came up with a more logical explanation for the strange behavior exhibited by the Klingons touching it - it makes much more sense to see it as carrying a ""virus"" or some sort of ""magical powers"" (the Hur'q factor, maybe?) than its mere symbolism causing friction... especially considering that the whole myth about it was that it would lead to unity (not division!) between Klingons. And, of course, the whole idea in this episode had to be eventually discarded (you'll find out how after watching), since it would have solved the Klingon - Federation conflict too easily, and make the Dominion threat less dangerous.",7

1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Our Man Bashir (TV Episode 1995)",The Name's Bashir...Julian Bashir,"Star Trek has proved adept in its nearly fifty year history of managing to make various genres fit into its futuristic framework. It's incorporated time travel and comedy into countless episodes and has even found time to pastiche and parody everything from gangsters movies to westerns with the latter being thanks to the holodeck. A good example of the holodeck being used to pastiche another genre comes from 1995 with Deep Space Nine's fourth season episode Our Man Bashir which took the James Bond films and other 1960s spy series and brought them into the twenty-third century.The basic Trek premise behind the episode of a holodeck malfunction was old hat even in 1995 when this episode first went out and, indeed, the powers that be behind the series had deliberately avoided such an episode as a result. Bob Gillan (who receives a ""story by"" credit here) came up with a unique twist on the cliché that impressed the show's production team. Ronald Moore, then a producer on the series, is credited with coming up with the 1960s setting and would write the eventual script. What Moore created is a wonderful pastiche of not only Bond but the entire 1960s spy craze. The episode's title echoes the 1966 film Our Man Flint while eye-patch wearing hit-man the Falcon calls to mind not just Bond film characters like Red Grant but also Marvel's own comic book spy Nick Fury. Numerous other elements echo Bond films throughout its then thirty year history from a card game at a French club to the villains lair and plot echoing elements of the Roger Moore era Bond films The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker. Indeed the episode was broadcast just days after the US theatrical release of the 007 outing Goldeneye. The episode proved not only to be timely but has also been well remembered by fans of Deep Space Nine as well. Looking at the episode, it isn't hard to understand why.For one thing, there's the performances and the chance to see familiar characters in a different setting. Julian Bashir is the most unlikely James Bond style secret agent that you're likely to meet but one of the joys of the holodeck is that things like that get to happen. One of the fun things about the episode is watching Bashir have to keep the holodeck program going while trying to balance both the fun of playing out the 1960s spy fantasy while also trying to keep his crew mates from getting killed. It isn't just Bashir as a character having fun as actor Alexander Siddig clearly is relishing the chance to play the role that one imagines every British actor imagines playing at some point. He clearly isn't the only one relishing the chance to essentially play a role in a mini-Bond film. Five of his cast mates get the chance to do just that in this episode and all seem to enjoy themselves, especially Avery Brooks playing the villainous Doctor Hippocrates Noah which gives Brooks the chance to play a role very much removed from Benjamin Sisko. It's also highly amusing to watch Worf walking around in a white tuxedo, smoking cigars and playing cards against Bashir or seeing O'Brien walking around wearing an eye-patch and waving a gun about. Of course, what would this scenario be without the Bond Girls which gives Nana Visitor and Terry Farrell the chance to play those very roles with Visitor playing a KGB agent and Farrell a scientist (something that has made the episode one of Nana Visitor's favorites according to DVD extras). Joining in is Deep Space Nine reoccurring character Garak played by Andrew J. Robinson who, as a ""real"" spy is a great source of comedy as he comments on just how unlikely the events taking place are. While Farrell in particular is underused, everyone does get their moment and everyone is clearly enjoying the chance being given to them.The cast aren't the only ones it seems either. There's some impressive work being done both in front of and behind the camera as well. The sets and costumes do a wonderful job of creating the 1964 setting that the holosuite is supposed to be portraying with period costumes and technology on display throughout. Production Designer Herman Zimmerman's work on Doctor Noah's lair in particular is an impressive piece of work that pastiche the iconic Ken Adams designed sets from the 1960s Bond films on a fraction of the budget. The icing on the cake though might be the Emmy nominated score by composer Jay Chattaway which rides the fine line between pastiche and copyright infringement rather nicely by creating a score that nicely echoes the John Barry style of Bond music (and arguably is a better Bond score that Eric Serra's score for that year's Goldeneye). All of which goes to show how inventive the show's makers could be when they were given the chance.Perhaps as a result of all that, Our Man Bashir remains a joy to watch. For a series best remembered for darker themes and a larger emphasis on ongoing plot-lines, the episode stands out from the rest of the series due to its tone and its pastiche nature. For fans of both the Bond films and Star Trek it's an essential piece of viewing for a chance to see two of the biggest icons of popular culture of the last fifty years getting the briefest of chances to interact.",8

That is the least the doctor's problems though; as a runabout returns to the station with Sisko, Kira, Dax, Worf and O'Brien it falls victim of a sabotage and they are beamed out at the last moment. They don't rematerialise and before they are lost their patterns are stored in the ships computers. Their physical patterns are put in to the holosuite and characters in the story take on their appearance but not their characters.

Bashir and Garak must play the program to its conclusion without letting and of the five get killed even though some of them are in the roll of dangerous enemies. While things are going on in the holosuite Nog races against time to retrieve the crew members before anybody gets hurt.Although I'm not usually a fan of holosuite set episodes this one was a lot of fun as it was always fairly tongue in cheek as it spoofed '60s spy thrillers.

The episode sees Sisko and Odo arriving on Earth where Starfleet Command has asked for their expertise in helping Starfleet Security prepare contingencies to protect Earth as they believe the Founders have have infiltrated the Federation.Aside from seeing more of Sisko's personal life in the form of meeting his chef father Joseph, what made this episode so good was watching as Federation Earth seemed to crumble as they prepared to face this new threat from within. After nearly four centuries on peace on the planet, I imagine the high levels of paranoia, fear and anxiety as people began to distrust even those close to them is exactly how humans would react despite claims they have moved passed such immature behaviour expected more from a 'barbaric' twenty-first century human. It also has hints, which link to how the Federation would eventually win the war, over why unity is more important than division.

A peaceful society is turned upside down by an act of terror, and the government uses the fear that the act of terror creates in its citizens to further its own agenda.

My guess is they had enough content for 1.5 episodes and needed to pad out the length with the ""no evidence"" detour. I just wish they could have come up with a better way to do it.

The problem now is that Sisko might not be up to the task of stopping them--especially since their leader appears to be Sisko's old Captain and friend, Admiral Leyton (Robert Foxworth).This episode was super-paranoid--even more than the first one. It also shows some of the worst parts of human nature--which I love. This is because all too often, the Star Trek future seems way too rosy and sweet. Here is evidence that people are still people!

However, there are rumors that someone will be making an attempt on this new Bajoran leader's life--and so it's up to Odo and Worf to protect the guy. There are BIG complications, however, as Odo is extremely distracted. Instead of his steady and efficient demeanor, he is silently pining for Major Kira--and the only one who seems to realize this is Quark. Much of this distraction is because apparently Kira is a Bajoran hottie.

He has been demoted after returning to Cardassia with his half Bajoran daughter. When they get to the site of the conference they find that the site has been destroyed by a Klingon bird of prey which is still in the area. Gul Dukat attacks it but the weaponry on his ship is so feeble that it not only fails to damage the target but the Klingons just leave thinking it isn't even a worthy target. This turns out to be a mistake as under Major Kira's guidance they take the base's superior weapons to increase the freighter's fire power before hunting down the Klingon ship which during an audacious attack Dukat and Kira seize the bird of prey and transports its Klingon crew to the freighter which Dukat then destroys. With access to the Klingon database they learn where all Klingon vessels in the area and Dukat is determined to use that information to counter attack against the Klingons... even though his Government wishes to pursue only diplomatic efforts. As he prepares to wage war alone he returns Kira to Deep Space Nine along with his daughter.This was a great episode which had plenty of action although that was secondary to the banter between Nana Visitor and Marc Alaimo as Kira and Dukat as he tries to recruit her to his cause.

Third, just an episode ago, she began a relationship with Shakaar--the new leader of Bajor. Now in ""Return to Grace"" we have a new and extremely odd romance of sorts beginning. Here, the Major is paired with Gul Dukat for a mission-- and it sure looks like Dukat is yearning for some good lovin' with the Major!The episode begins with Kira complaining about having to go to some joint Bajoran-Cardassian conference. Before she leaves, she's instructed NOT to give any human or Klingon technology to the Cardassians--a no-brainer, right? Well, perhaps not. When her ship (commanded by Dukat) nears the conference, it seems that all the participants have been blown up--presumably by the Klingons. Dukat wants revenge but it seems unlikely, as now he's only a lowly freighter captain--demoted due to the embarrassment of having a Bajoran as a daughter. However, Kira also wants revenge for the attack and she helps Dukat to go on a mission against the Klingons-- and there is a HUGE prize ahead--one that might just violate the Major's orders.This is a pretty good episode and once again establishes Dukat's strong attraction for Bajoran women--something that got him in trouble long ago and which will become a HUGE problem later in the series.

The Klingon Captain is much like the Germain Captain... arrogant and not considering the smaller trade ship as a threat. It's an enjoyable episode with only two of the regular cast having any real screen time. The fun is watching Gul Dukat try to undermine Major Kira relationship with First Minister Shakaar.

For a while, he was ostracized by the Klingons when his father was accused after his death of begin a traitor. When Worf FINALLY redeems his father's good name and becomes a trusted friend with the new Klingon leader, this wonderful period is very short-lived. When the Cardassian-Klingon war occurred, he refused to fight for the Klingons--siding with the Federation. And, as a result he was once again ostracized!

This has little effect on Worf as he had little to do with the Empire but Kurn can't live with the dishonour and insists Worf carries out a Klingon ritual and kills him. Reluctantly Worf agrees but he is interrupted by Dax and Odo and Kurn survives. Odo offers him a job with his security team but has to let him go when it becomes clear that he still has a death wish. While this is happening on the station Kira and O'Brien have a run in with the Klingons on the Bajoran border, they claim to be on routine exercises but the evidence suggests that they are in fact sowing a minefield. When one of the Klingon ships accidentally triggers a mine it is towed to DS9 and Worf and Kurn go aboard to discover the locations and detonation codes of all the cloaked mines. With this information it is possible to destroy the field which would have cut Bajor and DS9 off from the Federation. Kurn still wants to die but Dax come up with a way for him to live without the dishonour; it does mean Worf will still lose his brother though.This was a good episode with both action and good character development. As has happened before Worf finds himself divided between his Klingon heritage and his loyalty to Star Fleet and its laws. Tony 'Candyman' Todd did a good job as Kurn even though I didn't recognise him under his Klingon make up.",8
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Sons of Mogh (TV Episode 1996)",An absolutely despicable episode,"I always liked Klingon episodes in Star Trek TNG, because they had depth, great character development and offered great insight into the Klingon culture. Sadly, in DS9 the writers destroyed everything good that was built in TNG regarding Klingons, and their role as 'strange aliens' was largely taken by the Cardassians. Now I don't have a problem with focusing on the Cardassians, as most DS9 episodes involving them are really good, but it makes no seanse to negatively affect another race while doing that. ""Killing Kurn without killing him"", as Dax put it, is a simplistic way to cut the remaining ties with the Klingon world, eliminate one of the few Klingons (if not the only one) who was truly authentic - i.e. Kurn, Worf's brother - and artificially develop further the pathetic romance between Worf and Jadzia Dax. The fact that the Founders (i.e. the Changlings, the Shapeshifters) managed to seed distrust between the powers of the Alpha Quadrant - especially between the Klingons and the Federation - could have been much better and more realistically achieved than making Gowron turn his back on the allies that provided him with his Arbiter of Succession, making the Federation treat Klingons like ""allies"" that should better keep the distance (despite them coming to help DS9 against the Dominion in the previous episodes) or arbitrarily discarding Kurn's character because he was temporarily 'persona non grata' in the Empire. After all, Worf endured a greater dishonor for decades until he briefly restored his family's pride - why couldn't Kurn successfully face the same problem using his brother's guidance?Anyway, all these illogical choices of the writers pale in comparison with the abomination of erasing a sentient being's whole memory because, aparently ... ""it's better"" than physically killing that being. Excuse me? How is erasing someone's memory (I'm not talking about one particular piece of memory here, but the ENTIRE memory and experiences of that person) different from killing that someone, apart from the issue of terminating his biological body? The whole concept of life in the case of sentient beings (even more so for intelligent life) revolves around their memories and experiences - without them, that particular person is non-existant. Resequence a person's DNA and erase that person's memory, and he's a different person altogether - his or her old self is dead, period. It's still a crime, and the perpetrator is still a murderer, albeit not in a 'standard' fashion. That can go for real life too, not just for a TV series character.Also, what's funny is that of all people, the one performing the procedure is ... a Federation doctor. You know, the same Federation that swore to respect intelligent life (which is fundamentally based on a person's memories and experiences, as explained earlier). Another funny thing is why they couldn't erase just the problematic memories/experiences to solve the issue (maybe even planting a fake memory to help the process), instead of the whole memory. We know that in TNG that was possible, when dr. Pulaski SELECTIVELY erased the problematic memories of Sarjenka, a girl character from TNG's season 2 episode 15, 'Pen Pals', instead of wiping out her entire memory. But then, it seems that the Federation scientific research (and most importantly, its application) not only did not progress throughout both series, but actually regressed between TNG and DS9 - that's probably why the Defiant had to use limited Romulan cloaking technology instead of taking advantage of the MUCH superior cloaking technique from TNG's season 7 episode 12, 'Pegasus'. Granted, there was the Treaty of Algeron that prohibited the development or use of cloaking tech by the Federation, but that was already broken in that TNG episode, not to mention the existential threat that the Dominion posed to the Federation which should logically take precedence over any limitations enforced by an Alpha Quadrant treaty. But then, as I mentioned, logic doesn't seem to be the writers strong point - they mostly decide to do things in the series because, and I quote... ""it's fun"". Yuck!",2

Of course, in doing so, Worf throws his own life away; but he tries anyway. Worf must find a way to try to keep his brother alive.

And, in both cases, seeing them change and grow was a delight.When the show begins, as usual Quark is treating his employees like dirt. However, after hearing Dr. Bashir talking about the benefits of a union, Rom decides to lead a strike and force Quark to allow a union. Not surprisingly, this sort of thing is 100% non-Ferengi-- and the Ferengi government is NOT pleased to hear about this. What will become of this unprecedented strike?!

Soon an enforcer comes in and threatens to do whatever it takes. Except he has no real interest in Quark and his interests, only in breaking the union. Rom is courageous here. Generally, he is a much better man than Quark and multi-talented, to say the least. This is a bit preachy at times. Deep Space Nine did get at social issues at times.

What happened to her? She must have been alive on that Moon throughout the entire Dominion War.It's a mystery, that was never ever resolved to my satisfaction, and this is not just a loose end, it was a tear in the whole fabric of the DS9 story arcs.A Light-Sale craft emerges from the Celestial Temple, containing Akorem Laan (Richard Libertini) - A Poet from 200-plus years in Bajor's past.This person, claims to be The Emissary, and due to the regular twisting of Prophecy that occurs in this series, it actually looks like he MAY be the ""real"" Emissary.So, Sisko steps down - Which immediately causes a bunch of problems- So it takes Kai Opaka to step in and make The Sisko think about what the hell he has done.Maybe the writers of this 'sode were showing us, Opaka maybe had joined the Prophets and could appear to The Sisko like they do - But whether her appearance was really her, or the prophets, it took Kai Opaka to settle this mess!

The Bajorans happily accept their new emissary but when he says they have lost their way by abandoning their caste system they are less pleased although they agree to return to their old ways believing it must be the will of the prophets. This means Major Kira must resign from the military and become an artist as her family were from the artists' clan... even though she has no aptitude for it. Sisko is not pleased with the way Bajor is going and points out that having a caste system would make it impossible for them to join the Federation. After he is visited by the prophets he wonders if he was wrong to give up his role as their emissary and confronts Akorem, suggesting that the two of them go into the worm hole to determine who the prophets have really chosen. In the secondary plot Keiko returns to the station and tells Chief O'Brien that she is expecting another child. With his wife back the chief thinks he must totally give up his previous bachelor lifestyle although this leads to him getting under Keiko's feet so she arranges for him to go off to the holosuit with Dr, Bashir; telling each of them that the other is depressed and needs company.While not packed with action this was a decent episode which explored the strength of the Bajorans' faith and Captain Sisko's opinion of his role as Emissary which changes over the course of the episode. Richard Libertini did well in the guest role of Akorem, until the end I was unsure if his character would turn out to be misguided, a fraud or truly the Emissary, I was pleased with how he ultimately turned out.

0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Rules of Engagement (TV Episode 1996)",One of the bad ones....,"I am about half-way through the entire Deep Space Nine series, and some of these 'filler' episodes are agitating to watch. Don't get me wrong, I understand that to enjoy most Star Trek materials, there needs to be some suspension of logic (especially the time travel episodes). Deep Space Nine is prime-time TV science fiction from the 90's, it can't be measured with the same yardstick as more mature and sophisticated productions like Battlestar Galactica: Re-imagined. This is where Ron Moore cut his teeth, and I always felt that many of Deep Space Nine's episodes were quite impressive and demonstrated his writing talent. But having made that disclaimer, I have to say that the script for this episode stands out as particularly bad.The Klingons have declared war on the Cadassians. Since the Federation refused to support the invasion, Chancellor Gowron declares the Federation-Klingon peace treaty/alliance to be null and void. Worf, while commanding the Defiant on a convoy escort mission in a 'combat zone', is harassed by Klingon warships. After a number of 'shoot-then-cloak' attacks against the Defiant, Worf decides to adapt to the strategy and fires on a ship just as it de-cloaks, destroying the ship. As it turns out, the ship is actually a Klingon civilian transport with some 400 passengers on board. So the Klingons are apparently outraged and demand Worf's extradition to the Klingon Empire where he can stand trial for ""murder."" The premise for the story is virtually nonsensical. It is inconceivable that the Federation would even consider extraditing Quark under such circumstances, let alone one of their own officers. That the Klingons would make such a request is suspicious enough, but what's worse is that none of the obvious questions were asked during Worf's extradition proceedings.Why would a Klingon civilian transport ship be equipped with a cloaking device? Why would you install classified military hardware on a civilian transport ship to begin with, then send it to a combat zone? What conceivable reason would there be to cloak a run-of-the-mill civilian transport ship? Are there cloaking device dispenser booths on every planet in the Empire to ensure that every Klingon and their grandmothers owned a ship cloaking device? Why did the civilian transport ship de-cloak in the middle of a battle between Federation and Klingon warships? It seems the answers would be obvious, and one hardly needs to rely on Odo's contacts in the Klingon Empire to dig up some incriminating evidence that would indisputably establish this extradition as a farce (speaking of which, for someone so anti-social, Odo seems to have a lot of social 'contacts'....). I would not have taken this episode so seriously if it didn't take itself so seriously (I don't care to run the premise of the Ferengi episodes through a fine comb, because they are just plain fun to watch), and as I said, this one stand out as particularly bad.",

While the hearing is going on Captain Sisko has asked Odo to use his contacts in the Klingon Empire to see if he can find any possible motive for the Klingon ship to have deliberately decloaked in the middle of a battle.This was a decent episode and Ron Canada did a good job as Ch'Pok, the Klingon advocate seeking Worf's extradition. In an break from the usual for the series we the people giving evidence explain what happened while we see a flashback of the events; so, for example, we see Dax giving evidence while she is engaged in combat training with Worf.

This particular episode shows us a different side to O'Brien. His mental anguish at being imprisoned for over 20 years is excellent. This is one seriously overlooked Irish actor. With all this focus on other hotshot Irish actors this guy is superb. When Miles arrives home his family rally to help him as do his friends. But, the damage to his psyche is evident and his slow rehabilitation is sad to watch but compelling viewing. Nice to see Colm stuck with Trek even when his movie career was in the running",10

But enough of that... I never knew there was a DS9 Ep I missed during it's first run.Upon watching the DS9 4th Season DVD Extras, it mentioned this Episode, and I realised, I had NEVER seen Colm Meany with a huge mane of Irish Hair, in a prison.

It relates to the TNG Ep ""The Inner Light"". But whereas Picard has a life-enriching experience, O'Brien has just the opposite.And so this show deals with how O'Brien deals with his friends and family upon his release. And Dr Bashir cannot help O'Brien out as a ""friend"" - Only as His Doctor.I'm not going to say more - This one ep, is so good, that I will NOT put a spoiler in here. I've seen Colm in Feature films like ""Con Air"" and ""Layer Cake"" - ""Int5ermission"" was another of Colm's dark films. He's as good a crook as he is an O'Brien character. This 'sode reveals the darker side of O'Brien.After season 2 of TNG, I missed NO TNG or DS9 Eps, ever again- Not by choice. This one slipped through the cracks of Syndication.Had I seen this Ep First Run, I would have reacted the same way a lot of people reacted to TNG's ""The Inner Light"" - to this Deep Space 9 Ep ""Hard Time"" - It is Meany at his Irish Best!

He has a very long beard and tattered clothing and it's obvious he's been there for many years. However, soon you realize that this prison was a virtual prison and instead of being for 20 years, it actually only lasted a few hours. So what gives? Well, it seems a planet's government think that O'Brien was involved in espionage and they sentenced him to this 'humane' treatment-- implanting very, very clear memories in O'Brien. However, despite being released, it soon becomes obvious that the alien world did TOO GOOD a job on him--and they left him with horrible post-traumatic stress disorder and he's only a shell of his old self. This episode is truly amazing. The idea is very novel and it really gave Colm Meany (O'Brien) a great chance to act and even further expand his character.

As he is taken from his cell he wakes up and learns that in reality only an hour has passed since his sentence began; it was all an implanted memory, although to the Chief it will always seem as though he served those twenty years. Not surprisingly when he gets back to DS9 he has a hard time readjusting to his old life, strangely he also keeps seeing his cell mate even though he knows he is just a figment of his imagination. After an indecent in the bar he is suspended from duty and instructed to see a counsellor until he has come to terms with what happened. The problem is he isn't just dealing with twenty years away, he is also effected by the guilt of what he did to his cell mate even though he knows that in reality the memories are false. He also knows the memories are based on his own personality so the things he remembers are what he would have done if he'd really been there. Eventually he is left contemplating suicide and tells Dr. Bashir what happened.This episode might not have any real action scenes but it was great; Colm Meaney really shows his acting chops as the Chief, both as he readjusts to life on DS9 and, under a heavy beard, dealing with life in an alien prison.

4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Shattered Mirror (TV Episode 1996)",Enjoyable...but only if you suspend your critical thinking,"First, let me admit that seeing characters act differently from their main story line can be fun, and can make a decent time watching it. That being said, that's where the good part of this episode stops. The rest is just pure junk in terms of intelligent construction of 'Shattered Mirror', and I'll explain why:
the idea of parallel universes is ...erm... problematic as it is, to say the least (any number of parallel universes would require space-time-matter-energy duplication that is simply absurd scientifically), but even if you go past these problems the idea that easy travelling between these universes allow the same characters from different universes to coexist in one of the universes is even more absurd. A character from an universe shouldn't be able to exist in another ""parallel"" universe (i.e. outside of his own universe) - not to mention alongside his replica from the parallel universe - because all the space-time-matter-energy that he's made of belongs to a single universe: his own. That's why they're supposed to be ""parallel"" universes: because they coexist, but DON'T intersect...otherwise we would be talking about the same universe, now won't we?travelling to this parallel universe has been, as other reviewers mention, overused in DS9. Sure, it can be fun, but it becomes tiresome and boring after a while. After all the characters don't have any interest in involving themselves in the other universe, support an alliance or another, care for a person or another, for the simple reason that...duh, it's not their own (not to mention the apparently obsolete Prime Directive, regarding interfering in the matters of another 'world'). Which leads me to my next point...how the heck could Sisko and, even more stupidly, Jake, care deeply for the Jennifer from the other universe is beyond me, really. Hello, Sisko slowheads, it's NOT your wife/mother - it's an entirely different person. How could Jake, a Starfleet Captain son, be so charmed and easy to kidnap by someone who is clearly not his mother and bears no connection to him whatsoever is illogical, to say the least.the dumb plot doesn't stop there however. Get this: a Starfleet officer, a Captain in the Federation forces, the almighty Sisko, the first man tasked with stopping the Dominion's advances, makes a rookie ""mistake"": he falls into the same trap twice. Not only did Smiley (O'Brien's 'alter ego' in the parallel universe) easily captured him the first time in one of the previous episodes, but poor Sisko is incompetent enough to let himself being taken AGAIN to the parallel universe, this time along with his son. Now I don't know about you, folks, but this character is not the best father at all letting his son being taking away from him like that, and he's not worthy of being a Starfleet Captain if he, a hardened officer in one of the greatest millitaries in the galaxy, falls in the same trap twice. Imagine making such foolish mistakes against the Dominion - you're already conquered. I couldn't believe my eyes when he so easily bought Jennifer's claim that she was ""just visiting"" him... knowing the major problems in the parallel universe, he's fool enough to believe those folks may need a ""vacation"" in his own universe, hahaha!simple question: what do you do if a person who's the deadly enemy of your father points a gun at you and wants to know who you are? You lie, of course, because it saves your skin - you don't tell the person with the gun that you're the son of his enemy, inviting death, being taking hostage or being kidnapped... twice in a row. What does Jake Sisko do? Guess what: the exact opposite. Not smart at all, especially coming from an aspiring writer. Sure, Sisko being indebted to her was convenient for the alternate Kira and, of course, for a future (equally dumb) plot in the parallel universe, but made no sense if Jake wanted to survive and return home with his father.the Defiant, the station's shields and Bashir's ship was all that it took to make an ENTIRE fleet of angry Klingons to retreat and run back to their empire at maximum warp. I get it, the Defiant is a nasty ship and all (even though it seems to be on the brink of collapse in every battle it's involved in, at least visually), but to defeat Worf's entire imperial fleet that came to punish a handful of rebels? The writers must be joking, really.lastly, the nonsense that concludes all the previous nonsense above: since when Klingons (and Worf, alledgedly the most Klingon of all), retreat and run away from battle like cowards? I thought they were living under the motto that ""It's a good day to die"" and that ""Victory is life"", not to mention the honor they would throw away by leaving the battlefield. Ok, it's a ""parallel universe"", but Klingons are still Klingons if I'm not mistaken, and so far it all looks more like a parallel plot to logic and realism than a parallel universe episode.It was midly fun, but I have a big problem with stupid plots and unrealistic life and death decisions from the characters - hence the rating. The writers can make the story suit their desired outcome all they want, but for me, the outcome should be a consequence of the story, not the other way around.",3

The first plot involves Lwaxana Troi. She's come to the station for sanctuary, as her new husband (Michael Ansara) is a Tavnian and despite their agreement, he's decided that when their child is born, he'll be raised in a traditional Tavnian manner--with zero contact with females until he's 16. In other words, once Lwaxana's little bundle of joy pops out, it was be forcibly taken from her! She is not thrilled and seeks help from her old friend Odo. But what they have to do is pretty drastic! What exactly will they do?The second plot is uber-creepy to say the least. An older alien woman (Meg Foster) is VERY interested in Jake and seduces him. While the relationship isn't exactly sexual, it sure seems creepy and wrong-- and she also seems like a succubus. While her presence as a muse does stimulate Jake to write great things, she's also killing him! How can she be stopped and will it be too late?!This is a rather tender and sad episode. While the one involving Jake left me rather indifferent, seeing Odo professing his love for Lwaxana was very, very touching and is among the finest moments in the show. So, despite two okay plots, there are some wonderful moments in this one which make it underrated and well worth seeing.",8

Odo offers to help her and eventually finds a way to solve her problem which will be acceptable to her husband under his species' laws... Odo will marry Lwaxana! In the second story Jake meets a strange woman who takes an interest in his writing skills. She takes him to her quarters and encourages him to start writing; the words seem to flow from his pen but whatever she is doing to him to help him write appears to be having a detrimental effect on his health.This was a fairly average episode; neither of the two stories were that exciting and there was little real action.

But Sisko isn't about to just accuse her and he and his folks keep tabs on her and her space voyages. However, it turns out that this is all a ruse--and Eddington has ulterior motives. But what exactly is he up to?!In addition to this plot, Mr. Garak has taken time away from his bromance with Dr. Bashir to may a lot of attention to Dukat's daughter, Ziyal. But this relationship, if there is one, is obviously fraught with problems since Dukat and Garak are sworn enemies.Overall, this is a pretty exciting episode--mostly because it isn't stuck on DS9. Unfortunately, Eddington's behaviors were telegraphed in many ways, so none of this came as a huge shock--he obviously was never intended as a regular or one of the 'good guys'--a serious weakness of the show.*Oddly, near the beginning of the show when Worf talks about the Maquis, he refers to them as the 'Marquis'.",7

When Odo goes to search her ship Kasidy tells the Captain that she must be allowed to go as she is transporting medical supplies to a race who insist on punctuality. The captains lets her go but without telling her he dispatches the Defiant to follow her. As feared she deviates from her course and transports her cargo to a Marquis raider in the badlands. Sisko decides to personally follow her on her next run to catch her in the act and establish what she is giving to the Marquis. While doing this he leaves Commander Eddington in charge of the station so he can supervise the shipment of some industrial transporters to the Cardassians. Once again Kasidy goes into the Badlands but no Marquis come to meet her; after waiting to see what will happen the Captain realises it has all been a distraction to keep him away from the station. When he gets back he discovers that Eddington was working for the Marquis and the transporters have been stolen. In a secondary story Garak is getting closer to Dukat's daughter Ziyal even though he suspects her interest in him might be so she can do him harm and Major Kira has warned him to keep clear of her.This was a pretty good episode with a couple of surprises, I didn't expect Kasidy would have been smuggling to the Marquis nor did I expect semi-regular character Eddington to turn out to be a traitor. The secondary story was enjoyable, Andrew Robinson's Garak is always fun, especially when he is being paranoid and Tracy Middendorf put in a good performance as Ziyal, making her a likable character.",8

However, in pursuing the attackers back through the wormhole, Sisko finds a Jem'Hadar ship-- stricken and on the verge of implosion. The surviving Jem'Hadar soldiers are beamed aboard and that is when they learn that the ones who attacked DS9 are renegades--Jem'Hadar who are independent of their overseers and who COULD take over the entire quadrant. So, to prevent this, the new passengers on the Defiant and the Defiant's crew must work together to stop the renegades.Much of the show consists of the Federation and Jem'Hadar learning from each other. The Jem'Hadar are clearly super-arrogant and consider humans, Klingons and the like to be wimps--and they cannot understand how these inferior begins could be of any value. Jadzia Dax is surprised to learn how incredibly efficient the Jem'Hadar are. They never sleep, never eat, have no need for procreation or women BUT it comes at a price--they only live to be, at most, about 15! What follows is good but surprisingly easy. After all, these Jem'Hadar are supposed to be the greatest warriors in the universe and you'd think the battle with the renegades would be a lot tougher!

Sisko immediately returns to the Defiant along with Worf, Dax, Odo and O'Brien and heads back to the Gamma Quadrant in pursuit. They soon find a Jem'Hadar ship, this isn't the one that attacked DS9 however, indeed it has been attacked and is about to explode. The crew are beamed to the Defiant and their leader, a Vorta called Wayoun informs them that they were attacked by the same renegade Jem'Hadar group that attacked DS9. When Sisko learns that the renegades are in control of an Iconian Gate which they are trying to repair. These gates were constructed millennia ago by a long extinct species which allow the users to transport across the galaxy. If the Jem'Hadar were to gain control of such a gate they could use it to instantly transport millions of troops to any planet they wish to invade. As they prepare to attack the renegades' base it is clear that the Jem'Hadar have a very low opinion of the fighting abilities of the Star Fleet officers but after fighting side to side on the raid the develop a grudging respect.This was a pretty good episode which is notable for being the first to feature Weyoun, played by Jeffrey Combs who had previously appeared as the Ferengi Brunt. The raid while exciting was over quite soon but the build up was interesting and gave us plenty of good scenes showing the interaction of the two groups. The only scene that was a little weak was the holodeck simulation which was introduced as if it were the actual raid, this seemed a somewhat clichéd trick, I'd rather the viewer knew it was a simulation from the start, still that is a small gripe about an episode which was of a high quality overall.",8

What isn't mentioned are the numbers of bodies lying on the ground, many of them young soldiers (red shirts, so t.o speak).

What I will say is this is a good performance from Alexander Siddig, in Bashir gradually finding out over the series his strengths, but also his limits, as a physician and researcher. DS9 cast member Rene Auberjonois directs, and I think does a fine job in steering what could be a melodramatic or by the numbers episode into something with genuine emotional gravity. Ellen Wheeler also deserves considerable applause for her great guest star acting - she does much of the legwork in relating to the audience the depths and pains the Quickening disease holds for her people.This episode however is most memorable for me overall for what it says indirectly about the Founders' prejudiced and sociopathic stance towards other races, at this point in the series. It's interesting to imagine Odo being in this episode, and what that would have been like, but then the subtlety would have been lost. How paranoid and fearful the Founders are, that they have lost track so completely of the suffering of others, being blindly and tragically obsessed about control and order over others.

The Dominion, for whatever reason, exacts cruelty. They really have nothing to fear from the galaxy but when offended, ""punish"" those who offend them. They are anything but random. It would be like killing off all the cats in our world for no reason other than watching them die. Julian comes to a world where this ugly force has put a curse on the people. They contract a plague that they are born with, live with, and then die, Not in a simple way, but rather in agony. Bashir's efforts involve his best technology and it fails, until there is a ray of hope. This is an incredibly moving piece. For a kind of parallel, try reading or watching ""Children of Men.""",10

However, when they land the see that the place has been a hellish mess for a long time. It seems that this once- great civilization offended their Dominion overlords and as punishment, the Dominion released a horrible virus upon them. This virus doesn't kill the people instantly but causes lesions. Eventually, and there's no predicting when, they proceed to a phase called 'the Quickening'-- with intense pain and death. However, the folks on the planet, despite the automated distress call, don't seem terribly concerned about finding a cure--they just accept that they are all going to die and that is that. In fact, instead of doctors, they have folks like Trevean (Michael Sarrazin) whose job it is to help expedite their deaths...peacefully. Can the landing party manage to come up with a cure--especially when the disease is so incredibly resistant to treatment?This is an incredibly sad episode--certainly not what you could call a 'feel good' show.

They learn that up until two hundred years before it was an advanced civilisation but all that changed when they defied the Dominion and the Jem'Hadar introduced a disease that effects everybody. When they will die is uncertain, some die as children others survive until adulthood but ultimately all are doomed to die in agony. When Bashir takes a woman to the hospital he is shocked to discover that instead of trying to treat the illness people are just offered a quick death. Determined to help he tries yo work on a cure with Dax and a pregnant local woman called Akoria. Things don't go well and most of his patients die screaming. Dax returns to DS9 with Kira but Dr. Bashir is determined to stay with Akoria, trying to keep her alive until her child is born; trying to find a cure all the time. When the child is born he happily announces to its mother that it doesn't have the illness, shortly after however she dies.Even though there is little action in this episode I really enjoyed it. I was sure that bye the end we'd get a clichéd ending where the doctor would find the cure for all the sufferers. The fact that he found a vaccination which would stop babies being born with it meant that in the long term the society should recover but all the current sufferers were doomed just as they were before his arrival, this gave us a bitter-sweet conclusion. Alexander Siddig put in a fine performance as the doctor and guest star Ellen Wheeler was good as Akoria.",9
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Quickening (TV Episode 1996)",Good episode.,"Just now watched it, and I can say it will be worth it 20 years from now. I don't normally write reviews. Odo would not have been interesting in the episode because he has already rejected his peers, the founders. What is interesting is the human doctor, Bashir, having compassion for another species (although alarmingly humanoid, OK this IS Star Trek). This is a sad episode, a tearjerker, but worth watching to renew your faith in humanity to get the job done. Bashir risks life, remember the threat to kill him, to save the people he encountered. He delivers on his promise, but only to the surviving children. In my opinion, this was an excellent episode because it was not a complete solve, everything hunky dory. People died, but Doctors try, and I'm not a miracle worker, I'm a Doctor, damn it! (Bones was my favorite(for personality), but Bashir is good too). It would not mesh completely with Ayn Rand's Objectivity (Atlas Shrugged, or Fountainhead) or maybe it would. The good doctor's one track obsession with curing the people is his own objective. Each person to their own objective. Read Atlas Shrugged about a year ago, just finished Fountainhead. At least now you know what influenced my review. It's only a show, but it also might reflect how you regard life in general. I personally prefer to see life flourish in all its forms.

Just as he is celebrating he hears that a mistake has been made and he will not die after all. When he learns that the person who bought his remains was Brunt and that he has no intention of letting Quark out of his contract he is in trouble. He has too choices; he can break the contract and be both ruined and shunned by all Ferengis or he can have himself killed so Brunt can get his merchandise. Being a good Ferengi he opts for the latter and asks Garak to kill him in a way that is painless and that he won't see coming. As he sleeps he he finds himself in the Ferengi afterlife... or at least he thinks he does, he is in fact dreaming and what happens in his dream persuades him that it is better to be broke than to be dead. Brunt is quite pleased to be able to shut the bar and take all of Quark's assets but soon after Quark learns that he has other assets; his friends who give him the items needed to reopen. In a secondary story Dr. Bashir, Kira and Keiko return from the Gamma Quadrant after a shuttle accident. Keiko was injured and the only way to save her and her baby was to transfer the baby to Kira, something which is a shock for Chief O'Brien.This was an enjoyable episode, Armin Shimerman did a fine job as Quark, he portrayed his quickly changing moods in a believable manner, Jeffrey Combs also did a good job as Quark's nemesis Brunt.

Major Kira is on hand and agrees to carry the O'Brien spawn. This was done, incidentally, since Nana Visitor (Major Kira) was pregnant in real life and this strange plot was contrived to explain her girth through a few episodes. I think this resulted in Quark's heart growing two sizes that day.The other plot involves Quark--meaning it's the 'funny' plot. It seems that he's been told by a doctor that he's dying (that AIN'T the funny part) and he's got to make arrangements soon, as he only has about a week to live.

Why is he like this? Well, no one is sure and the only answer seems to be heading to the Founders' world and asking them. Fortunately, instead of destroying the Defiant, a representative of the Founders meets them and offers them safe conduct. However, she then informs Odo privately that the Founders are responsible for this supposed illness--and it's all been orchestrated to bring him back. But why?

He isn't pleased with Garask's interference in his private life but before he can leave his shop Odo collapses, unable to maintain his form properly. Dr. Bashir tries to help but can think of no way to save Odo, this leaves just one chance: go to the Gamma Quadrant and take Odo to the Founders to see if they can heal him. Not long after passing through the wormhole they are intercepted by several Jem'Hadar ships and boarded by several Jem'Hadar and a Founder. The Founder explains to Odo that he has been deliberately infected to force him to return home to face judgement for killing another changeling. After a while in the Great Link Odo emerges and he has changed, he is no longer a changeling. Normally one would expect this to be the end of the episode but the story continues when they get back to DS9 and see a recording of the Klingon Chancellor Gowron threatening war with the Federation. As he watches Odo recalls something he saw in the Link: Gowron is a Changeling! This was a great conclusion to the season providing and interesting story with moments of both danger and humour. Rene Auberjonois does a great job portraying Odo's suffering both from the illness and coming to terms with the fact that he will have to live as a solid from now on. Andrew Robinson also puts in a good performance, his tales of plotting and intrigue designed to keep Odo's mind of his illness were entertaining and his attempt to destroy the Founder's home world were as surprising as they were exciting.

Odo is nearly dead and when he talks to the female shape shifter, she tells him that he is the only one who ever killed one of his own and he needed to be tried. It's interesting that these Dominion people are so self-righteous about their own kind and have no problem sending the Jem'Hadar to wipe out total civilizations. Garak plays a significant role after talking Sisko into letting him come along. He wants to know what happened to his fellow Cardassians after they were defeated in battle. The answer from the Dominion woman gets his blood boiling.

Shortly after finding after learning where the station sends its messages a shield activates and captures O'Brien and Dax. The mission is so important that Sisko abandons them, heading onto the coordinates they found, unfortunately here they are intercepted by the Jem'Hadar despite being protected by a Romulan cloak. As the Jem'Hadar board the Defiant Odo escapes in a shuttle with an injured Major Kira and heads to the Omarion Nebula, somewhere he felt drawn to ever since shown it on charts earlier in the episode. Here they find a planet on which there is a strange lake, a lake made up entirely of beings like Odo.This episode was a good introduction to the series and a great introduction for the Defiant even though as the episode ends it looks as if the ship might be lost before the mission is over. It was also nice to finally meet Odo's species even though we learn nothing about them at the conclusion of the first part of this two part story.

So, when season three begins, there are some big changes in store in order to meet this awful threat. Commander Sisko is away doing briefings with Starfleet. When he returns, he has a HUGE surprise for everyone...a new ship! The USS Defiant is a very small but insanely powerful ship designed to meet the threat of the Borg. But, now that the Borg threat seems to have gone, it's to be based at Deep Space 9 in order to help protect it. But the biggest surprise is that this super-ship has a cloaking device--and a Romulan officer to serve on her!! Obviously the Romulans now consider the Dominion to be a greater threat than the Federation. Plus, over the last few seasons of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", the Federation has done a lot to improve relationships with their old enemies.This two-part episode concerns the Defiant's first mission into the Gamma Quadrant. The plan is to sneak through the wormhole and take the attack to the Jem'Hadar and hopefully find their masters, the Founders--who are the real force behind the Dominion. Unfortunately, the ship, though powerful, fairs VERY poorly and Odo and Kira escape in a pod...seemingly before the ship is destroyed.Chock full of excitement and violent--that's what I like in this series.

Things are not going well; The Romulans are threatening war as they have not been invited to the treaty talks and the Jem'Hadar are acting with impunity, in fact those assaulted by them are more likely to be in trouble with Star Fleet security than they are.

One evening there is only one customer in the bar; Kozak, a drunken Klingon who doesn't have the money to pay for the drink he is demanding. When refused service he lunges at Quark with a dagger but is so drunk he falls over and lands on the blade. Sensing that it would be good for business if people believed he'd killed a Klingon he claims to have killed him in self defence. When the Klingon's brother turns up he is prepared to tell the truth but is told that if he does that he'll be killed; dying in combat is honourable for a Klingon, falling over drunk and killing yourself is not. It turns out that the brother's motives weren't honourable though. Had Kozak died in a dishonourable way his wife could have inherited his house but because it is believed he died honourably his brother has claim to everything. There is one solution for his widow Grilka; she can marry the man who killed her husband and keep his estate. Quark is shocked when she kidnaps him and takes him to the Klingon home-world and marries him and she is unimpressed when he asks to look at the financial records of her former husband as such things are beneath Klingons. She changes her mind however when she learns that Kozak's brother had been financially undermining him for years, something totally without honour. When Quark exposes the brother he is forced to face him in combat, a seemingly impossible task.This was a great episode which showed that even a money grubbing Ferengi like Quark can have more honour than a Klingon warrior. Mary Kay Adams did well as Quark's new wife, it was nice to watch her respect for him increase as he helped her even though it meant risking his life.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The House of Quark (TV Episode 1994)",To paraphrase Quark; this episode IS a 'gift' for the viewers.,"Armin Shimerman, who plays DS9's barkeep, Quark, is worried. Business is down - way down. Just when all seems lost, a (very) drunk Klingon - the sole customer at the bar - demands credit, and as all Klingons are wont to defend their honour - even, here - when it's not necessary - and falls upon his knife, in Quark's arms.That's the true story, but, sensing theirs potential for a big uptick in business, Quark tells Odo, and loud enough to all in attendance - that he actually killed the Klingon (D'Goth), in self-defence.But, then, appears 2 people; the first, is the dead man's brother, Kozak, to whom Quark perpetuates the lie. The second - is Grilka, the dead man's wife.But, partially fearing her wrath if he doesn't come clean with her, and partially because, it's readily apparent, Quark is entranced by Grilka, he tells her the truth (a he gushingly says to her, after she's listed all those he's lied to; 'it's a gift').Armin Shimerman is one of the best actors in an ensemble cast, which is full of very talented actors, but, what sets Mr. Shimerman's performance(s) apart, is when one realises the limitations he has, working underneath the massive amounts of prosthetics are doing, it's even more amazing.I give the same 'bravura' to all the cast members, who do so much, with so little - facial expressions, that is.The prosthetics these folks wear covers their foreheads, down past their eyebrows - so, one of the most expressive parts of a face (human, and otherwise!) - are not seen.This means they're left to rely on nothing talent - something he, and the others do, with aplomb.This episode is a tour de force for Mr. Shimerman, as well as Mary Kay Adams (Grilka) - the object of Quark's affections.These 2 characters - who seem so mis-matched, are, in fact, perfect for each other.As DS 9 is single-handedly the most dark, sombre of all the Star Trek series, each year, there's always a couple of episodes which is played strictly for laughs - which given some of the 'heaviness' the actors (and, us the viewers) allow a chance to relieve some of the tension.This episode's about love - both the main, 'A' story, as well as the 'b' (Cheif O'Brian's attempts to help his wife Keiko). Additionally, it's also about the very deep love Rom feels for his brother.The House of Quark is a fun take-off on (several) Shakespearean works - as it involves people pretending to be what they're not, and 'forbidden love', i.e., a Ferengi, and a Klingon, and all-in-all, it shines a funny, well-written terrifically acted light on one of DS9's best characters, and the actor, who embodies him.",
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The House of Quark (TV Episode 1994)",Mary Kay Adams - The best Female Klingon,"...Well, next to Kehylar, Worf's original mate - But she was half ""Hooman"".This ep explores things that were initiated in Next Generation Klingon 'Sodes. The Production even uses Matte paintings and Sets created for ""Sins of the Father"" and ""Redemption"". But this 'sode goes a bit farther, revealing more about Klingon Family Traditions.In the same way Mary Kay Adams (Grillka) acts to save her house, there is a B-Plot in this 'sode that shows the O'Briens dealing with some difficult changes. So... the common element of both plots are Family Ties.Of course, as this sode is Quark-Centric, it begins and ends with Quark. This 3rd season Ep brings Quark to the front, and he becomes a lot more dimensional than his initial portrayal as the Ferengi ""Barkeep"" with eyes only for Gold Pressed Latinum. Armin Shimmerman gives the character more dimensions than a Fringe Alternate Universe plot line - So from this ep on, the Ferengi are treated with more respect than they originally got in the whole 7-year run of Next Generation. And even Gowron gives Quark one of the best compliments ever - Which actually created a tie between the Ferengi species and the Klingon species.Mary Kay Adams created Grillka - Yes we know her character was created by writer Tom Benko for this ep in a Teleplay by the great Ron D Moore, but Mary Kay Adams - Best known as the Narn ""Na'Toth"" in Babylon 5 after taking up the role from Julie Caitlin Brown - created an image of a magnificent Klingon Woman - Proud, Powerful and even unattainable by Worf in a later 'sode (Looking for Par'mach in all the wrong places). I admit, I wish she were real - And as Brian Thompson/Klag in the Next Gen ep ""A Matter of Honor"" states, regarding Will Riker and Klingon Females - ""They are inquisitive, they would like to know how you would endure... Them!"" and my response is the same as Riker's ""One? Or Both?"" - But that would only apply if there were two Klingon Women as magnificent as Grillka, and there is not - Because Martok's wife Sirella (Shannon Cochran) is of course, married to Martok.Of the three Klingon Women explored in Next Generation and Deep Space Nine - Kehy'lar, Grillka and Sirella, Grillka is the best... But there is a 4th, Kahlest - Worf's ""Nanny"" played by Thelma Lee - Who also was memorable, for a ""Klingon Bag Lady"" (She tells Chancellor K'mpek he's still too fat).Klingon Women, got to love 'em!",10

And something is not quite right in Jadzia - Or is it DAX?At first, she picks up Jake's electronic Piano and starts fiddling with a melody. She quickly becomes obsessed with it, humming the melody and not remembering. Then she starts acting very Un-Jadzia-like, snapping at The Sisko and accusing him of cheating in 3 Dimensional Chess.And she begins to have hallucinations of Masked figures who have even more masks underneath... and some unknown Trill Security Guards. So The Sisko and Doctor Bashir decide to bring Jadzia back to Trill, a visit to ""The Symbiosis Commission"" where they run some tests.The tests confirm that Jadzia is low on a particular kind of Symbiote-Goop, dangerously low.

His only concern is saving Jadzia. And the threat of The Sisko broadcasting this information on a planetary scale is enough to make the Commission see reason and let Jadzia be fixed, or rather Dax be fixed.The memory of something bad had been erased from the Dax Symbiote.

Perhaps he was so small and unimportant to the gestalt of the Fellowship of Dax Hosts that he could be easily forgotten with no Harm done.

The core mystery and its resolution bring many classic Trek themes into play, such as how identity affects a person and how decisions reflect what truly matters to a person, but we also get the deep personal significance for Major Kira that's possible due to the ongoing development of her character and the Bajoran & Cardassian cultures throughout DS9's early seasons (TOS and TNG could almost never do an episode like this because the characters don't have the history and every week they'd move onto a new culture; the only comparable sequences I'd argue are from Worf's character arc in TNG).Another reviewer criticized how this is similar to TNG's ""Face of the Enemy""; that entirely misses the point of the episode. ""Face of the Enemy"" was an espionage suspense thriller - there were no personal stakes for Troi really, it was much more a ""will they succeed or won't they?"" type of story. This episode is entirely about the character - what would it mean for Major Kira if her entire life was a lie, if she really was part of the enemy that destroyed her culture, the enemy for which she'd given everything up to help defeat? And how do the events of the episode complicate her (and the viewer's) view of Cardassians? The central uncertainty of the plot perfectly mirrors the moral uncertainty of the DS9 universe, and really harkens back to the brilliant first season episode ""Duet"" (the central plot device in fact is practically the exact inverse of the central plot device from ""Duet"").If you're looking for suspenseful action you'll find this episode dull; but then again if that's the case, why are you watching Star Trek at all?",10

Actually, it was the Bajoran Central Archives- basically, the planetary Mainframe. It amazes me how EASILY the Cardies invaded those Bajoran PCs, we'd think that in the future, they would not use the same Puter conventions we use - Local storage facilities and independent operating systems in workstations. Even Windows 8 is now veering toward an ""Appliance Based"" system, where the user's files will be stored not on the local, Mechanical Hard Drives, but on a remote server. We know that federation uses some kind of ""Data Crystals"" - This is similar to storing info on Flash Drives. Soon, we will have Hard Drives that are wholly non-mechanical - As a matter of fact, there are many Solid-State storage devices being sold today - Eventually the prices will drop and more people will use them.But on Bajor, it has been three years since the Cardies left the planet in ruins... So we must imagine that the Bajoran Techs have ""Paper Clipped, Taped and Glued"" together many Systems out of the wrecked systems the Cardies left.Kira is way too easily tricked into leaving the station, and she is then kidnapped by a Cardy Agent- One that looked like the same species as Ty Kajada (Julie Caitlin Brown) from the season one ep ""The Passenger"" - So the Cardies are using 3rd parties to infiltrate DS9.This ep explores the intricacies of The Obsidian Order and we learn now, that ""Plain Simple Garak"" is neither Plain nor Simple, he's a former member of the Obsidian Order.A great 'Sode, but wracked with various statements that will come into question in later 'sodes - Kira's father did of course get killed fighting the Cardies, but her Mother had a fate different than the fate Kira tells the Obsidian Order agents. We do not know at this time what Gul Dukat reveals to Kira about her mother... So table that for a later (6th Season) 'Sode.What is of import here, is that it is revealed that the Cardies have photographic memories, and also that the cardies use Intrigue more than Brute Force to obtain objectives. So in fact we learn a LOT about Cardies in this Ep and especially Garak.Ultimately, Kira herself is not the target for the Obsidian Order. Who is? Watch this Ep and find out! But when you do it, you will have to take all of the 20th century computer-isms for granted. Take it from me, it is NOT so easy to gain entry to computers on a network!

Secret force fields and emitters left without comprehensive investigation? Direct control of the station auto-destruct sequence linked to some unnamed malicious security program that goes undiscovered? Nobody tried to initially contact Gul Dukat or cardassian central command? Gul Dukat getting trapped in his own web and willing to destroy the treaty over a space station? Granted I think it's plausible that there would still be several unknowns taking over this station (although a security program of that size interconnected with so many systems is an impossible stretch for me), combined together this was all a little too much. After building up the efficiency and ruthlessness of the Obsidian Order over the seasons, this episode made the cardassian security protocols seem comical and prone to error.I think the replicated AI disruptor drone is probably the best example of incompetency in that it makes the federation seem sloppy for missing a replicator capable of producing energy weapons and the Cardassians inept at creating an autonomous and highly advanced targeting drone capable of distinguishing between lifeforms and then making it stationary, reducing its effectiveness and also preventing more from being replicated on the pad.Despite the ever entertaining Dukat and Garak and a few other interactions which were enjoyable, this episode seems like a miss due to the level of suspension of disbelief. If the federation/bajorans don't do a major sweep of security/protocol after this incident then the station deserves to blow up after the next little unknown that pops up.

He plays Tiron, a wealthy creep with a thing for Major Kira, and he tries to lean on Quark to obtain her. Of course, Quark can't make her do anything she doesn't want to do, and the results are hilariously disturbing in a ""Windowlicker"" kind of way. This storyline, while somewhat weak and silly, is way better than the A plot, wherein Jadzia Dax falls quickly and conveniently in love with the handsomest, ruggedest resident of a planet that only exists in this dimension every sixty years. It's almost romantic, except that Terry Farrell and her supposed paramour Brett Cullen have absolutely no chemistry.

Whoever wrote this episode should be ashamed. Whoever greenlit it should be ashamed. People who happened to be standing near the set when it was filmed should be ashamed. It was just hack writing and a hack episode.I'll give it three stars because of the B-plot, and that's stretching credulity too. The B-plot wasn't bad, per se, but it was also lazily done. It had so much untapped potential for hilarity that the writer never attempted to explore. That one joke at the very end wasn't nearly enough to make the plot worth it, especially when a better writer could have turned the entire sequence into a really funny farce.

Tom Riker, the clone created in a transporter malfunction. As soon as Kira deactivates the security systems to show him the bridge controls he stuns her with a phaser before simulating a warp core malfunction and offering to take the Defiant to a safe distance from the station. Once the docking clamps are released he takes the ship to warp and heads to the Badlands along the Cardassian border. Realising they are dealing with the other Riker, Sisko heads to Cardassia Prime to help them prevent a war. Once Riker has beamed a Marquis crew aboard he heads for the Orias system deep inside Cardassian space. Here they are intercepted by Cardassian warships which comes as a surprise to Gul Dukat who thought Orias was just an uninhabited rock. With the Defiant facing impossible odds Sisko suggests a deal to Dukat; spare the ship and its crew and he can have the sensor logs showing the activity of the Obsidian Order in the Orias system, if Riker accepts the offer he will have to agree to a life sentence in a Cardassian penal colony.This was a good episode and it was nice to see a guest appearance from Jonathan Frakes as Riker, this was made more interesting by the fact that he wasn't playing the better known Will Riker. I liked the fact that this episode provided Sisko with quite a dilemma; does he help an enemy destroy his ship and in doing so kill Major Kira or does he let Riker get away with his actions and risk a war? It also gave us a further insight into the Cardassians showing us that the Obsidian Order clearly operates outside the law.",9

Night Shyamalan plot arc; great buildup, then disappointing finish. spoilers followDespite some fairly unbelievable breaches of security when Tom takes over the defiant, this episode has some exciting movement to it. My favorite parts of the episode were in the Cardassian command center and illuminating the power and structure of the Cardassian governement and Obsidian Order.The ending was a big letdown. Felt like a cop out and was very abrupt. The showdown between the Obsidian ships and central command war ships was cool, but the Riker change of heart was not well played out and the good bye kiss and kira swoon were weak. I thought that moment took away from Kira's character, especially seeing as how she mentioned earlier in the episode that she was seeing someone.However, the worst part was how the maquis crew responded like starfleet officers and not like rebel/terrorist members. They just take the reassignment to a bajoran militia major like it is no big deal and resign themselves to the fact that they have been captured and are going to have to face trial. Not saying that they have no honor, but they outnumber the major and are still in possession of one of the most powerful ships in the quadrant. To hand that over and surrender when there is still a chance of escape seems out of character for how the maquis have been portrayed in previous episodes.",5

However, it turns out that it's NOT William but his identical version, Thomas (to see more about this, see ""Star Trek: The Next Generation: Second Chances""). Years before, due to a weird transporter incident, two Rikers were created and one was left alone on a planet for several years. This stranded one is different--and perhaps has a strong need to differentiate himself from his identical counterpart. While he says he's there for a visit, Thomas is actually there to steal the defiant for the Maquis. After all, he IS exactly like William down to his DNA, so it should be easy for him to obtain the craft for his co-conspirators. What's next? See the show.All in all, this is a pretty good episode though the resolution to the problem seems to come too easily and too quickly.

The problem is they had all these pieces in place, all moving towards this massive conflict... then nothing happens. Nope Tom Riker pussyed out and decided not to go through with it. He'd rather spend the rest of his life in a prison camp then go out in the blaze of glory. What?! Why take the time to build all this tension then have no conflict. It's like a woman who teases a penis but does not finish. It aint right. That's what this episode did to me. Don't get me wrong, it was fantastic in the beginning but in the end I was alone with massive blue balls. 5 stars out of 10.P.S. Like Michael J. Tobias said, they should've made this a two parter.

Otherwise, it's a pretty far departure from the show's norm. The story is about a big festival day with a lot of lovers reuniting. But for some funny reason, love runs amuck, and many unusual crushes and flirtations appear. I chose to watch this episode for Majel Barrett, who proves she is still one of the best TV actresses from 1960's, if you like that exaggerated style. Majel's character (Counselor Troi's vampy mother) has a romantic fixation on Oto. Many other characters get fixations, too, and things get topsy-turvy as love goes out in all directions. Love, love, love—too much love, and none of it quite right. There are a lot of fun twists in this Midsummer's Night Star Trek, and some viewers will like it while others will hate it.

There is another passenger of great interest on the transport - the Betazoid Ambassador Lwaxanna Trois has also come to the station to attend the festival. She immediately latches on to Odo - much to his resigned chagrin. Things start going oddly awry as many of the characters seemingly fall madly in love - Jake with Kira, Bareil's with Dax, Kira with Bashir and most amusingly Dax with Sisko. Brooks does a wonderful job in the scene where Dax first comes o to him. The side story is, in this episode, the serious one as O'Brien and Keiko have a serious disagreement regarding the issue of her staying on Bajor with the science expedition much longer than originally planned. Chao and Meaney are great in this as we see two people who truly love one another get into a potentially a relationship destroying argument. It's the kind of argument that's easy to relate to. Well done indeed. The second good part of the episode is Majel Barrett as Lwaxanna Troi. So often irritating in TNG, in this one she is more amusing and in her final scene with Odo, surprisingly sympathetic. It is quite a touching scene of self awareness and regret. The resolution to the strange goings on is satisfactory. All in all, an entertaining episode.

The worst moment was when Keiko dropped a bomb (so to speak) on Miles and when he rightfully got upset, she told him he was acting like a child (oooh...low blow time). The bottom line is that by the end, EVERYONE is pretty miserable in their relationships! It almost seems like someone has spiked something on the station!!!

1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Past Tense: Part I (TV Episode 1995)","Twenty years later, this is disturbingly familiar","I'm a Star Trek fan from its beginning, and I know that one thing they do poorly is time travel. This story is not an exception to the general rule, but today's viewer can be distracted from the flaws by the jarring effect of seeing what writers in 1995 considered fiction.The ""sanctuary"" district in San Francisco interns the homeless, the unemployed, and mentally ill people. The government processes them and hands out food stamps. Welfare is not merely accepted, but an enforced one. The writers call the Bell riots a watershed moment of the 21st Century as a harbinger of change for the better. Today we can look at this fiction and see how much closer we are to it now than we were twenty years ago. I've always admired Arthur C. Clarke for his vision of the future. He was startlingly accurate in his depiction of online media, but we lack only extraterrestrials to drive us forward into his vision. ""Past Tense"" doesn't require its writers to look so far ahead. They only had to extend a trend line of poverty a few years out. But, while it might have seemed far- fetched in 1995, today's viewer can see that the trend line is no longer fiction.The only real requirement is that the writers not let the characters get in the way. There is little in the way of character development. Sisko, Bashir, and Dax are observers, even when Sisko has to take part in the action.Still, I'm not convinced about the writer's view of neckties in 2024...",7

These districts are used to enclose all the homeless, unemployed and in some cases mentally ill. It is a dreadful place with roaming gangs of thugs; people do not have adequate food or housing and medical attention is nonexistent. Bashir is appalled at the conditions and simply cannot understand how such conditions can be allowed to happen. Sisko, by an incredible plot coincidence happens to be a student of this period of history and knows that soon there will be riots, the resolution of which will change the course of history. A man named Gabriel Bell will protect hostages and the world will learn the truth about the Sanctuaries. Unfortunately, Bell is killed when trying to protect Bashir from thugs. In the meanwhile, Dax, with the help of a wealthy protector tries to find out the whereabouts of Sisko and Bashir. I am a fan of time shift stories but I did not find this one particularly interesting even though the acting throughout was convincing. Given this show is from the mid nineties, it was quite striking that the view of 2024 was of a period of massive unemployment and distress. A thought that is now too close for comfort.",6

As for Jadzia, she's is a heck of a lot smarter than her companions and soon she ends up finding herself with the HAVES-- living life among the rich elite. It's easy to admire her ability to think on her feet and figure out that she's in the past much faster than the guys. Regardless, the two guys turn out to be REAL stupid, as they turn out to be responsible for killing a guy who is important to history--and as a result, the timeline is seriously destroyed and the Federation doesn't appear to be affected.This is a decent episode but I also marveled at how clean and very well groomed these homeless folks often were!

4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Past Tense: Part I (TV Episode 1995)","Deep Space 9's Version of ""Future's End""","It's not that Time Travel stories are *explained* well in the Trek Universe, it's that they are *performed* and Produced well.Every time travel tale has a gimmick or a gadget. I should say, every ""Unwanted Time Travel"" tale because in Trek, these are all accidents. Twice in the Trek Universe has time travel been done deliberately, in 1968's The Original Series episode ""Assignment Earth"" and in 1986's ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home"".As far as I can recall, these are the only two instances that were deliberate, maybe The Original Series ""All Our Yesterdays"" - Which had Kirk deliberately setting up a time portal for Spock and McCoy. Although, the original time travel was an accident because Mr Atoz (Ian Wolf) accidentally let Kirk jump into the ""Atavacron"".Whether in TOS, TNG (Time's Arrow), Voyager or on DS9, Trek has a style when it comes to Time Travel stories, there is always some gadget that caused it, be they the Walls of the Cave on Dividia II, or in this case, a malfunction of the Romulan Cloaking Device which had been installed on The Defiant.What interests us here, is that in our world, this story almost happened - In Los Angeles, where creation of something like what we see here, a ""Sanctuary District"" almost happened, by bean-counting reactionary politicians in that city whose solution to the Homeless problem is to not see them and then refuse to acknowledge their existence. One thing I will say, is that this so-called ""Forced Welfare State"" will never happen, it is always the choice of the Citizen to use Welfare, or to not use it. Most people who are on it, don't like the necessity of being on it. But it is better for it to BE there so we CAN choose to use it or not, I won't have someone else ""Choosing For me"", by denying me the right to choose it - By Eradicating it.Fortunately, this concept was shouted down by the public in our world, it never happened. However, in our Trek story, this is going to happen in 2024, about 9 years from now.What is great about Trek is that they can foresee future technology, sometimes getting it right - We already have communicators (iPhones) and things like Tricorders. What I like here are the Future ""Internet Terminals"", which look like a cross between a 1980 Dynagraphyx Dumb Terminal and a 80486 or maybe even a Pentium system, with extra displays and a Stylus. One thing was done right, the security cards used to access the terminals, I don't think USB had been put into use back when this was made, but today we have security chips flashed into USB drives, I use one for Pro Tools to enable my Plugins, it holds my I-Lok User ID and my Account Info. This is not the first Trek episode involving Time where something got changed and our Principles must needs change it back, Harlan Ellison wrote ""City on the Edge of Forever""- Which is the same as we see here, future is changed, something very bad has to happen to change it back. Or rather, something bad did happen, was accidentally prevented, and it changed the whole future.These episodes are basically iterations of ""The Butterfly Effect"", or in Fringe science, ""The Firefly Effect"", but it is all the same thing, the idea that if time travel can occur, would changing very minor things result in a drastic change in our history?

Actually, the ""Riot"" portion of it did occur there, in 1992, and in 1995, the aftermath of those riots were still visible. Writer Ira Steven Behr took something basically from his newspaper and wrote it into what we have here. What I will say is I love that guy, he was not afraid to hit the nail right on the head and he is even a fan of Iggy Pop, who was supposed to be in this episode. Iggy of course appears as the Vorta ""Yelgun"" later in ""The Magnificent Ferengi"".Mainly, nobody wants a ""forced welfare"" state, but they don't want a ""No Welfare State"" either. In the 24th Century, Earth is an alleged Paradise: There is no need for money, people work for pleasure. It occurs to me that this is not explored much in any of the Trek series, we get a small glimpse of how Life on Earth was in the 2nd Season Voyager Episode ""Non-Sequitor"", but we've never had a good long look at how this ""Perfect Society"" will appear.But this episode sits in the aftermath of those 1992 Riots, and can be revisited today with the Baltimore Riots. Which makes this a difficult episode to talk about, The Sisko is basically holding several people Hostage and incites a full scale riot, even one that will be named after him in a way.The ingredients of the Riot are already mixed. There is always that one incident that pushes people over the edge. The Sisko, Bashir and Dax had landed on Earth right at the moment one of these incidents was about to ignite. The Sisko tries to avoid becoming involved in it, but in true Trek fashion, he becomes practically the central figure of the whole incident.Mostly this episode deals with the issues of Homelessness and Repression, several characters are shown who ""don't care"" - As long as ""they don't have to see it"". Jadzia confronts several of these people at a 2024 ""Party"" in her rich savior ""Chris Brynner's"" Office (Played by Jim Metzler who was, appropriately, the City Councilman in LA Confidential). She is able to show Chris Brynner *why* he should care and this becomes an important plot point later.On a humorous note, O'Brien and Major Kira (with a ""Broken Nose"") have to visit a San Fransisco Alleyway through several historical periods as they search for what era the Away Team had been spirited off to, in one era, it's the entrance to a Speakeasy, in another, they confront stoned Hippies, in each case the decor is perfect, especially the 60's- Ironically, I used to work in the Print Shop on Dore Alley where those 60's Rock Posters for The Fillmore were printed.Regardless of how I feel about Trek Time Travel episodes, this pair of episodes are a nice mid 3rd season distraction from the upcoming and developing Dominion storyline. One thing I liked about these 90's Trek series, was that most of the seasons had a full 26-episode contingent, which gave plenty of time per season for all kinds of tangential stories. Most series these days are only allotted 22 episodes per season.",10

They only have enough chronoton do check a handful of possible times and when they are down to their last attempt they must make an educated guess as to which it the most likely time to find them.This episode was a decent conclusion to the story with plenty of tense moments and rather more deaths than I'd come to expect in the later series of Star Trek, these were justified as the event had to be significant enough for us to believe it could change the policy of the day.

Sisko and Bashir are faced with having to recorrect historical events that they damaged in the first place. The whole second half involves a hostage situation where it is absolutely necessary that these people be kept alive. One trigger happy young man is a loose cannon.

The best part of the episode is Bashir' interaction with the hostages, especially with the scared and ill social worker; I'm finally getting to like the Bashir character who has fortunately finally outgrown his gee whiz adolescent character. Also good was the brief scene where one of the residents relates how he happened to end up in the Sanctuary - it was a powerful scene. The final resolution is logical and satisfying, particularly the former hostage security officer's assistance in helping Bashir and Sisko get away and preserve the myth of Bell's heroism.

I must say this episode has a very good premise and good set (though the 2020s tech looked too primitive lol) but what troubled me is the characterization of BC, a scoundrel who does not hesitate in killing in the first part but gives in too easily to Sisko in the second. He seems to have too much ""reason"" in him. The riots and him all seem a bit too civilized. (budget limitations I presume) Perhaps a more violent riot would not fit in the Star Trek persona of the show. And I think the result that no history except Bell's face was changed is really unconvincing. Won't some minor events be altered and trigger bigger changes? I would like the reset button of history finally be pressed, but the characters uncovered some new truths to history that nobody has known so they deepen their comprehension on history, and the time trip would still be worthwhile without tampering with temporal paradoxes. If you don't understand what I am suggesting, you can refer to how Discovery dealt with the tragic fate of Capt. Pike.",7

6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Past Tense: Part II (TV Episode 1995)",Poignant and Powerful,"Anyone seeing this episode in today's late-stage capitalist society can really connect the haunting parallels between what this episode predicts and where society is headed. Sadly, even this dystopian depiction of where things lead us to may have too optimist of an idea as to how we'll ever get kicked out of our mindset (if ever). Things have already been in the state they are in this episode with refugee camps and homelessness reaching epidemic levels, and nobody's been galvanized into doing anything about it.Regardless, this episode and the one before it touch upon classicism and the lack of empathy between the lower and upper class divide, worsened by the upper class making themselves as remote from the lower class as possible. This is a real concept that exists, and what this episode does better than most others is it doesn't depict all of the homeless people as sideshows in a circus with a human interior-- but rather humans first, and their downfalls next.Anyone who says this episode is ""preachy"" is either likely not in the demographic the message is intended for, or sadly is lacking the empathy to consider the message delivered (which, frankly, I'm surprised they're watching Deep Space Nine at all, as it's all about considering things from other points of view).Once this message is delivered and taken home to the heart of society, only then can we ever hope to get anywhere near what Star Trek as a whole hopes to take us to.",

As Dr Bashir is watching a monitor he notices there is still some neural activity and after some radical procedures he manages to revive him although he is still far from well and if he is to be able to assist in important treaty discussions between Bajor and Cardassia he will need a treatment which could cause him to relapse after a few days. Bashir counsels against it but he insists after Kai Winn says how much she needs his help. In a secondary story Jake and Nog have a falling out after a double date goes horribly wrong due to Nog's beliefs about how woman should be treated being different to the others.This was an interesting episode in which Alexander Siddig did a good job as Dr Bashir who must provide treatments even though he advises against it. Nana Visitor also put in a good performance as Major Kira who must deal with what is happening to the man she loves.,7
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Life Support (TV Episode 1995)",Performance Driven and Thought Provoking,"In the Star Trek tradition, this episode attempts to wrestle with, in this case, the weighty philosophical issue of vitalism -- the dualistic notion that their exists both a physical process as well as an additional ""spark of life"" (as Bashir called it in this ep) separate from the physical processes of chemistry and biology, that somehow is needed to essentially provide that ineffable and vital quality that makes a living being, especially a human being, fundamentally different from the more rote processes described in science texts. For the Trek vision of reality, at least, this ""spark"" cannot be simulated with any kind of advanced technology. Roddenberry, despite his nontheistic personal beliefs, always seems to embrace this notion of vitalism in the Trek universe, which always manifested as the human spirit being triumphal over the highly advanced thinking machines of his future; a world in which machine intelligence is never quite capable of achieving a level comparable to that of human beings no matter how advanced technology becomes. Whether or not one appreciates Roddenberry's original notion of mind vs machine is another matter altogether, but this episode stays consistent with the canonical vision of vitalism and spiritual duality long established in prior Trek story lines and, in that way, provides a good foundation upon which to build this episode's story.As to the story, this is definitely a performance driven episode, namely for Nana Visitor and Alexander Siddig with some good support work from Louise Fletcher (Kai Winn) and Philip Anglim (Bareil). While Siddig's performance was strong as the compassionate doctor the writers did not challenge Siddig in this episode much; his role was very straight forward. Visitor, on the other hand, who plays the head-strong reactionary ""Che Guevara"" role very well, was given a chance to portray her character's more tender and emotional side. Unfortunately Visitor continues to struggle in her portrayal of this side of her character, a feature of her acting style that is apparent throughout this series.The secondary story in this episode between Nog and Jake, too, is overshadowed by the gravity of the primary one, making it an odd story pairing, as well as a fairly forgettable one too. Also, given the earlier episodes where Odo's affections for Kira were firmly established, this rather blatant ""write out"" of the Bareil character from the story was a transparent and simplistic choice. An opportunity for exploring the far more interesting and realistic complexity found in love triangles, for example, was lost by this choice.Criticisms aside, however, this was still a fairly enjoyable episode. It goes a long way in further establishing the psychopathic character of Kai Winn, whose wonderfully ambiguous portrayal by a grandmotherly and overly polite Louise Fletcher is both an acting and writing highlight throughout the DS9 run and no less of a joy to watch in this episode.",6

Two Cardassian scientists have figured out how to send messages through the Wormhole/Celestial Temple, they are assigned to share it with The Federation and Bajor. But The Cardassian Obsidian Order is also assigned—To foul things up.There is a lot going on in this pivotal DS9 Episode. The Sisko, still uncomfortable in his role as Bajoran ""Emissary"" to The Prophets, is approached by Vedek Yarka (Erick Avari) to send the three Cardassian ""Vipers"" packing back to Cardassia. But there are only two scientists? But Yarka says there will be a third, and there is. A Third ""scientist""/""Viper"" appears at the last minute, but she is not what she appears to be.Yarka tells The Sisko about an ancient Bajoran prophecy, regarding the ""Three Vipers"" which are going to toss the ""Sword of Stars"" through the Celestial Temple, Burning it. This Prophecy appears to be coming true in front of The Sisko's eyes. At first, The Sisko rejects his role as Emissary in this, and intends to act simply as a Federation Officer regardless of Prophecies, and rejects the Prophecies as nonsense. The Experiment will continue.When the Defiant gets to the other side of the Celestial Temple, a rogue Comet is going to pass within close proximity to The Temple/Wormhole. As Kira sees the Comet she mutters ""The Sword Of Stars"" - Which was the way the ancient Bajoran prophet worded it. And so another part of the Prophecy comes to pass-The Sisko has to start taking this into account-He has no longer any choice.Meanwhile, O'Brien has to work with one of the Cardassian Scientists - Who likes to eat ""Hooman"" food-""Gilora"" played by Tracy Scroggins, who is a gorgeous, traditional Cardassian woman. When the two take to arguing about every system on The Station that O'Brien had to repair or change, Gilora takes that as a kind of sexual pursuit by O'Brien: Apparently Cardassians flirt with each other by arguing all the time.This fits into the Theme of misinterpretation which this episode is exploring. Vedek Yarka is interpreting the prophecies the wrong way, O'Brien and Gilora are misinterpreting their social actions the same way.What this episode explores, is the fact that ancient prophecy is not necessarily incorrect, nor has no place in a modern scientific society: The Bajorans have places for both Technology and Religion, the problem is, the Federation has no place for it.But The Sisko cannot do his job simply as a Federation Commander: He also has to do it as The Emissary as well. He must Protect The Celestial Temple.This episode has some of the best exterior graphics: The ""Sword of Stars,"" ""The Tree Vipers"" and The Celestial Temple are given some radical shots which make this episode worth watching. Most important, we are made to think. In Our ""real world,"" Ancient Bible prophecies are not necessarily wrong, but sometimes they are incorrectly interpreted, causing all kinds of problems. Faith actually has a place in a Scientific environment. They sometimes work together.This is the first episode where both aspects: Scientific and Religious, are used hand-in-hand to solve a conundrum, once the Bajoran Prophecy was taken into account, it gave The Sisko a course of Action with which to save The Celestial Temple, thus allowing The Prophecy to fulfill itself. This is normal, as prophecies go.And so the prophecy is totally fulfilled, and a relay station to The Gamma Quadrant is made, because ""The Three Vipers"" burned The Gates of The Celestial Temple, leaving a trail through the Wormhole.O'Brien and Gilora also leave with a healthy respect for each other, without some of Gilora's input, O'Brien would not have been able to do what he needed to do. But it was also Gilora's exposing of the Obsidian Order Agent, ""Dejar"" (Jessica Hendra) - That was an act of Bravery, exposing who she was and what she had done, allowing The Sisko to pilot a shuttle-pod through the Celestial Temple while dragging ""The Tree Vipers"" - The Three Broken Shards of the Comet.This episode, in the middle of the series, is a kind of ""Calm before the Storm"" - We know The Dominion is out there, but at this time we do not know what they intend to do. There are also Klingons being stirred up into an agitated state.",10

Not surprisingly, Sisko is very skeptical-- especially when his being the Emissary is brought up again and again in light of the prophecy about the wormhole. At the same time, some Cardassians are on the base...and folks are very suspicious of them.I appreciated how the Bajoran prophecies are NOT superstitions on the show.

Of course the prophecy is full of metaphors but as they come closer to testing the system more and more things happen that could be seen as the prophecy coming true. Sisko refuses to believe that an ancient prophecy could come true but Kira isn't so sure. When they turn on the relay it effects a comet making it head for the worm hole, if it enters it is indeed likely that it would destroy the wormhole.This was a decent episode with plenty of tense moments as well as some humour; I laughed when one of the Cardassian engineers through Chief O'Brien was making a pass at her.

Ethan also wrote the DS9 episode ""Children of Time,"" and so it looks as if this writer has a good handle on writing stories where there are little ""Time-Hiccups""— His other DS9 episode has similar conundrums: And what makes these stories interesting, is that they ""Make it never happen"" when it comes to future events witnessed by our principle cast, in this case, Miles Edward O'Brien.In this episode, our writer uses the gimmick of the Forced Quantum Singularity: Which was introduced in an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and according to that episode is the power source for a Romulan Warbird (TNG Ep ""Timescape"" s6e25).This episode begins and ends with O'Brien's Dartboard: O'Brien had been shocked by some Ionic radiation while working in Ops. After Bashir fixes him up, O'Brien sets up his Dartboard in Quark's. As O'Brien tosses a dart, he is brought five hours into the future, where he witnesses Quark complaining to a future O'Brien that Klingons are destroying his Holosuites again. The original O'Brien is brought back to the past, right at the moment his Dart hits the ""20"" mark (The ""20"" mark is an actual target in a typical Dart game).At first these little time jumps are just an interesting irritation for O'Brien, until he starts seeing himself killed in various ways. Each time he is able to ""Change the Future"" and prevent himself from being killed, only to have something worse happen the next time he has a jump.Is O'Brien fated to die? Is he being prevented from preventing his own death? That's part of this puzzle: While this time-jumping thing is happening to O'Brien, there is a contingent of Romulans on the Station who are trying to dredge information about The Dominion from the crew of The Defiant who had been captured by The Founders. At the same time, there are three apparently drunk Klingons who are not what they appear to be, they are actually spies for Gowron: They plant a snooping device into the wall of the habitat ring, which O'Brien sees killing his future self when he tries to futz with it.In the background of all these disparate events, there is always an invisible something, orbiting the station: It has qualities of a Black Hole, but it is orbiting the Station in an elliptical Orbit: Each time it passes O'Brien at a certain place in its orbit, it triggers his Time Jump—Every Five Hours like Clockwork. Now as I had seen every Next Generation episode, I knew what this was, but I had to see how it played out in the story at hand.What makes this an outstanding Trek Time-Episode was that ""The Future"" that O'Brien was seeing, kept changing according to how O'Brien dealt with it, eventually he has dialog with his Future Self and Future Bashir which offers solutions for his present self and Station.Using the solutions offered by those future versions of himself and Bashir, he prevents something insidious from happening to the whole station: But at the cost of his past self. And so, the O'Brien that is left at the end of this episode, is not the same O'Brien that began this episode. Or is it? So O'Brien gains about 3 extra hours of Memories, things that never happened: Until he gets back to The Bar with Bashir, and it happens again, this time without being shoved five hours into the future.This episode is also similar to the Next Generation episode ""Cause and Effect"" (s5e18).",10

Using the knowledge he has gained in the future he manages to avert that fate but it seems he may just be destined to die as the next jump shows that he has died because the doctor missed something in his scans and the jump after that shows the destruction of the station.

0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Through the Looking Glass (TV Episode 1995)",Commander Sisko visits the mirror universe.,"So far I've enjoyed all of the mirror universe episodes of Deep Space Nine and this one is no exception; they tend to be slightly tongue in cheek, usually restrained female characters become sexually provocative and because it is the mirror universe their counterparts of the regular characters can get killed. This story sees ""Smiley"" O'Brien come to Deep Space Nine and kidnap Commander Sisko so that he can take the place of Captain Sisko, who was killed, on a mission to extract a human scientist who is working for Intendant Kira. The complication is that the scientist is his wife who doesn't like him in this universe.This episode was a lot of fun, the cast were obviously having fun playing their less restrained mirror-selves. The mission was exciting and had a nice conclusion which left the key mirror characters alive so we can look forward to seeing them again. The only thing I was left wondering at the end of the episode was did Commander Sisko tell Lt. Dax and Major Kira just how much he enjoyed the company of their mirror counterparts when he got home? Somehow I doubt it.",9
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Through the Looking Glass (TV Episode 1995)",Decent but perhaps they should stop these sorts of episodes.,"""Through the Looking Glass"" is the second follow-up episode that ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" has done which was inspired by ""Mirror, Mirror"" from the original ""Star Trek"" series. I adored ""Mirror, Mirror"" and didn't mind one follow-up--but by the time this third episode debuted, it all started to feel a bit overdone. Unfortunately, more of these ""Mirror, Mirror"" inspired shows would follow. Imitation is not necessarily a good thing.When the show begins, Mile O'Brien kidnaps the Commander. Soon, Sisko realized this isn't the REAL O'Brien but one from the parallel world who plans on using him in the new Terran rebellion. It seems that Sisko's counterpart in the parallel universe has died--and Sisko is needed to finish his double's job. Why? I have no idea.Apart from the lack of originality, the show also suffers from an improbably resolution that comes too easily. Not great but at least it's fun watching the hornier and deadlier Major Kira.",6

The episode allows more development of the space station's Cardassian tailor, brilliantly underplayed by Andrew J. Robinson, revealing that he has more up his sleeve than threads and needles.Responding to a request from his mentor, Enabran Tain, superbly performed by stage and film veteran Paul Dooley, Garek is forced to interrogate a captured Odo in order to find out information that can quell the movements of ""The Founders,"" the shape-shifting race to which Odo belongs. As the story develops, Garek pulls out all the stops in his questioning of security chief Odo, prohibiting Odo from reverting to his liquid state. This makes for some intense banter between the two.Also in the cast are Juliana McCarthy, late of ""Sisters"", as Garek's housekeeper who is more to him than just a former employee of his parents.Besides the expert acting from all concerned, the two episodes provide the first glimpse of major space battles to be seen on the series. It is obvious that the budget for this episode, along with ""The Die is Cast,"" was significantly higher than previous ones.These two are must-sees for fans of great science fiction drama.",
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Improbable Cause (TV Episode 1995)","Tinker, Tailor, Cardassian, Spy","Avery Brooks helms this episode which highlights Andrew J Robinson as ""Mister Elim Garak.""Garak's daily discussion with Bashir is about Literary Works: Some of the finer concepts of Cardassian Writing are looked at, primarily that in a Cardassian Mystery Novel ""All of the Characters are Guilty, but the Mystery is, which Character is guilty of what, and when."" Bashir counters with the Bard of Star Trek, William Shakespeare. Garak is unimpressed that Caesar did not guess that his best friend Brutus would betray him.This episode and the next are reflections of both of these Shakespearian and Cardassian concepts. A Bomb goes off in Garak's shop and The Sisko assigns Constable Odo to find out why/how/who.Odo does indeed find out why and how, but the ""who"" is another matter: After a suspect is blown into microscopic kibbles and bits by the Rihannsu (aka, Romulan) intelligence organization the ""Tal-Shi'Ar,"" It becomes evident to Odo that Garak blew up his own shop. Odo meets with his secret Cardassian ""source"" who tells him that Garak's assassination attempt is part of a larger picture that involves Romulans somehow: And several Obsidian Order agents that Garak knew were also killed, or, rather, they suffered unfortunate natural deaths or accidents all on the same day.Garak had actually known this, which was why he ""blew himself up."" It certainly appeared as if somebody was targeting members of The Obsidian Order, and Garak is worried about his ""Mentor"" Enaubrin Tain (Paul Dooley). Tain's housekeeper/confidant Mila (Julianna McCarthy) confirms this: Tain had left suddenly and she charges Garak to find him.And so what promises to be an ""interesting trip"" begins: Odo gets a Runabout and with Garak in tow they set out to find Tain.But when they get to the planet where they may find Tain, a Romulan Warbird De-cloaks and tractors in their Runabout. And they are greeted by none other than Tain himself, who was the one responsible for cleaning up all of his own ""loose ends,"" one of which was Garak.Tain is actually pleased that Garak has survived, and offers Garak the opportunity to join him: The Cardassian Obsidian Order along with the Romulan Tal-Shi'Ar have secretly created an invasion fleet, to go into the Alpha Quadrant and wipe out The Founders.As Tain says, ""The Federation has shared the location of The Founders home-world with The Romulans, and they have shared it with me.""Odo immediately becomes a prisoner, and Tain assigns Garak to interrogate Odo: And so we know what it going to happen, but we will have to wait until the next episode to find out.This episode clears up some hints that were dropped: In the episode ""Defiant"" Thomas Riker in the stolen Defiant attempted to destroy the Omekla III Shipyards in the Orias system: We now know what they were building. But it is the interaction between Odo and Garak and then Garak with Tain that keeps us glued to this: If the goal of a series is to make us care about the characters, then this Deep Space Nine episode was a smashing success: In fact, the characters of Odo and Garak were so well-conceived that we had no choice but to become involved in their stories. And I myself was intrigued by this Enaubrin Tain fellow, and why was he so important to Garak? We begin to find here in this episode which is planted at the exact center of the series Timeline.The noted Character actor Leland Orser is Lovok: An interesting Romulan Commander- And a Romulan with even more secrets. And so, we already begin to see the connotations of Bashir's and Garak's discussion about literary works: The Cardassian reference was this episode, coming up is the Shakespearian reference.",10

As always Garek says that he can't have been targeted due to his past in the Obsidian Order as he was never part of that organisation... although nobody believes that of course.

The ships De-cloak as they pass Deep Space Nine and enter The Celestial Temple.The governments of Cardassia and Romulus promise The Federation that ""something will be done about this"" but The Sisko knows, that both of those governments will do absolutely nothing to stop this fleet. And neither will The Federation, as they secretly hope that it will be successful. The Sisko is ordered by Starfleet to sit around at The Station and twiddle his thumbs: But Odo is with that fleet, and The Sisko is not about to sit on his own hands. So he orders everyone to The Defiant. With them goes Lt. Cmd. Eddington, Starfleets ""Non-Odo"" Security Officer.Odo and Garak had been involved with ""A Simple Investigation"" to find Enaubrin Tain: They have found him, or rather he has found Odo and Garak, and now Odo is Tain's prisoner.The Moment Odo's runabout was Tractored in to the Warbird we knew he would be imprisoned, but what we did not know was that Tain has charged Garak with his interrogation.Garak tries to get Odo to cooperate willingly, but even Garak knows, ""Fat Chance."" Garak even tries to tell Tain that Odo knows nothing, but it is either Garak interrogates Odo, or someone else does.It is up to Garak. Tain gives him a machine, which Odo initially scoffs at: But what Odo does not know is that this machine will prevent him from changing shape, even to his liquid state.So Garak begins to ask Odo questions. Meanwhile, on The Defiant, the cloaking device suddenly shorts out, leaving them exposed to The Jem Ha'Dar: It was Eddington. Since we never liked Eddington that much, because he was ""The Quisling."" When The Founders and The Vorta had the crew of The Defiant in the Device during ""The Search part II,"" Eddington was the only crew-member who was actually co-operating with The Founders and The Vorta. This was not explained then, but it becomes apparent now that there is something not quite right with this guy: Why would he uphold The Dominion's interests during the simulated reality interrogation? In this episode, he reveals himself to be a legalistic bean-counter, which makes his upcoming role in the DS9 story a strange reversal, from legalistic to anarchistic in one easy step.Odo absolutely refuses to cooperate in any way, but Tain's machine is keeping him from reverting to jelly. Odo is degenerating into a rag doll, and it is apparent that Garak is revolted by having to torture him, he hates doing it. Eventually Garak gives Odo a way out: ""Tell me anything, any fact I don't know, lie if you have to"" and this is where Odo finally decides he can trust Garak, he knows, Garak will never repeat anything he says to Tain or anyone else. I was expecting him to tell Garak about his attraction to Kira but instead he admits to Garak that he wants to go home: To The Great Link.The Romulan Commander Lovok (Leland Orser) tries to press Garak for why he was protecting Odo, this is Garak's famous line: ""I've never been psychoanalyzed by a Romulan before, this is a fascinating experience"" and Lovok tells Garak: ""You are a practiced Liar but I am a practiced Observer."" This immediately shows that Lovok is more than he appears.The Romulo-Cardassian Fleet reaches Odo's Home Planet and they begin to bombard the place, but it was a Trap: The Dominion knew all about it, all along, because Lovok was a Founder and he even encouraged Tain. 150 Jem Ha'Dar ships attack the fleet and blow them to bits. Garak quotes Shakespeare to Tain, ""The Fault was not in our Stars, but Ourselves."" The Cardassian and Romulan intelligence forces were efficient organizations and a definitive threat to The Dominion, now disposed of.The Defiant arrives just in time to save Odo and Garak's runabout - Lovok had allowed Odo to leave. Because No Founder has ever harmed another.So Ends a pair of episodes which set the tone for the next three and a half seasons of Deep Space Nine.

As the invasion fleet goes past Deep Space Nine on its way to the Gamma Quadrant Sisko request permission to go after it in an effort to rescue Odo and Garak; permission is refused but he goes anyway taking the rest of the senior crew with him in the Defiant.This was an exciting episode with plenty of thrills and a few surprises, the highlights however were the scenes between Garak and Odo, Andrew Robinson and Rene Auberjonois put in great performances. It was interesting to see that Star Fleet would be happy to see the invasion go ahead even if they officially disapprove.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Die Is Cast (TV Episode 1995)",A follow-up to the prior episode...,"At the end of the last episode, Garak rejoined his old 'friend', Tain, with the Obsidian Order. Now, at least, the audience knows exactly who Garak was--and they learn his real name as well as his old status as the #2 man of the Order. In addition, the Order is able to take Odo custody--and they want to cross-examine him to learn more about their enemy, the Founders. Why do they need this information? Because some rogue Cardassians and Romulans are planning on attacking the Founders and, hopefully, ending any threat to their empires.When the show begins, Tain pushes Garak to interrogate Odo--though Odo is less than helpful. Additionally, though the Federation is against the attack on the Founders in principle, they have a wait and see attitude--and order the Commander to stay put. Naturally, however, the Commander chooses to ignore this and he proceeds into the Gamma Quadrant with his ship, the Defiant. This is an action-packed episode--with lots of explosions, bravery and betrayals. I like this sort of episode--especially since ""Deep Space 9"" was so often cerebral. Well worth seeing--and a shade of evil Founders action to come.",9

The first half ended with his joining forces with an evil man with whom he once had an alliance and to whom he owed a huge favor. He must save face and is forced into torturing Odo. I thought for a moment, he was in spy mode, but his allegiance to Tain turns out to be genuine. The writing here is excellent as is the non-stop action.

Meanwhile back on the station Doctor Bashir is upset when the student who beat him to the top place in medical school visits Deep Space Nine and totally ignores him; this leads to a night of drunken singing with Chief O'Brien.While the main story wasn't the most exciting in the series it had some exciting moments and although it was not really surprising it was nice when they accidentally proved the ancient could have got to Cardassia. This episode is notable for a couple of things; it was the first to feature Leeta, played by Chase Masterson, even if all she does here is make a pass at the doctor and impress him with her ample cleavage, secondly Jake tells his father he knows a woman he might be interested, while we don't see her here she is destined to be an important part in Sisko's life in later episodes.",7

It introduced the character of Leeta, the Bajoran dabo girl who would become a major part of the Ferengi arc. It was the first episode where Commander Sisko wore a goatee. The subplot really cemented the friendship of Bashir and O'Brien, as the two Brits sang ""Jerusalem"" while getting drunk together. In addition to that, Jake for the first time reveals to his father that he wants to become a writer. He also told his father about Kassidy Yates, who was later to become Sisko's wife. Although these are all good reasons for liking the episode, it is simply a fun stand-alone that glows with good feeling and gets better with time.",10
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Explorers (TV Episode 1995)","An apt reference to Earth history, with great character development.","In the three first episodes of Deep Space 9 there are many stand-alone episodes, but this one may just be my favourite. To the untrained eye or uninformed it may be difficult to see why, so I shall try to explain the reference.The story references, by drawing a parallel to ancient Bajoran early interstellar achievements, the Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdal who battled against an entire world's academia of disbelievers to embark on a journey to prove that the indigenous peoples of South America crossed the Pacific ocean on rafts to settle on the south-east Asian islands.Until that expedition, called Kon-Tiki, the world believed the indigenous people of South-East Asia originated from Asia itself. But Thor Heyerdahl knew otherwise. He set out to disprove those assumptions, and against the odds managed to scrounge funding somehow against all the odds. He made it to Tuamotu Islands in 1947, proving his theory.In this episode, Commander Benjamin Sisko takes on this role, setting out to prove that ancient Bajorans, from before humankind even dreamed of the stars, could sail to Cardassia in rudimentary ships propelled by simple solar sails, a theory that has never been proved, nor has it been particularly widely believed to be possible.The episode is a feel-good reminder of what Star Trek is all about. Even the most simple exploratory mission can lead to dispositional changes between cultures, respect can be found through plain passion alone, and that you shouldn't take what you have for granted.The character development is evident within, with Sisko and his son bearing the focus of the story.",9
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Explorers (TV Episode 1995)",A wonderful Star Trek episode,"There isn't any episode of ""Star Trek"" quite like ""Explorers"". It is at heart a character study, with excellent scenes between Sisko and Jake. A little creative license is taken with the solar sails, although that didn't stop the episode being given an award by the Space Frontier Foundation for its creativity. The inside of the solar sailing vessel is also very interesting looking and quite evocative of a Jules Verne novel.The episode also has an excellent ""B"" story with Bashir facing a competitor from Starfleet Academy and features Bashir and O'Brien together singing when drunk.",10
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Explorers (TV Episode 1995)",Scientifically horrendous,"The episode itself is passable, neither very good nor terrible, but it's hard to look past the enormous flaws in the design. Solar sails are an old idea, which means the writers are not justified to not realise they would need to be kilometers' wide to function. The steampunk feel of the ship may be aesthetically interesting, but space travel with astrolabes and sextants is pushing it too far. And the concept that one man can build such a spaceship in his backyard in a few days borders on laughable. Not to mention that 800 years in the past is hardly such a long time for an interstellar journey to pass into the sphere of legend. Other problems, such as the inability of the ship to take off from the planet surface or to land, or return, are secondary.All in all, I think the series goes to great lengths to establish the Bajorans as possessors of some sort of admirably rich culture both technologically and spiritually, like they went through an idealised Earth past - but for me, such exaggerated and unrealistic (even in Star Trek terms) plot devices make them more and more annoying as a species.",5
5,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Explorers (TV Episode 1995)",Lightweight and Dull!,"While it's nice to have a father bonding with his son, the episode was like watching Ozzie and Harriet. There were no villains. Even the conflicts as the spacecraft sailed on were uninteresting. After such a couple of outstanding episodes, this one just sat there. Bashir's meeting with his former classmate was even duller than the main plot. Hopefully, we will get to something of some substance. Oh, we have to remember that Sisko will be meeting some woman who is a freighter captain.",5
6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Explorers (TV Episode 1995)",Totally out of order,"This episode does not belong to any of the star trek series.It's script has way too many incoherences not only to any sci-fi logic, to the entire star trek universe, to DS9 series, but even to it'self. Those flaws are too many to describe but i would suggest to those that pay too much attention in the series coherence to skip this episode in order to avoid getting frustrated.The only thing that i would say you could find interesting is the first appearance of Sisko with a goatee which may stand for the turning of him to a more serious character for the rest of the series (like he wasn't a stiff already), he also shows some interest in galactic archeology and history (a futile attempt to come closer to the character of Picard) and the first (unreasonably) friendly gesture by the cardasians towards him, without any gain for them.",1

Obviously some time elapsed between this and the prior episode and it's odd no one mentioned this in any way.The plots of this one are incredibly slight. First, just like Thor Heyerdahl and the Kon-Tiki, Commander Sisko decides to fly some sort of space sailboat across space to lend credence to a theory that the Bajorans were great outer space explorers during ancient times. He takes Jake along with him and the two do some bonding. And, second, speaking of bonding, the bromance between Dr. Bashir and Miles O'Brien is going to a greater level of intimacy. When an old rival of the Doctor's comes aboard and doesn't seem to recognize him, he's bummed and so he and O'Brien decide to get drunk and get to know each other better. Overall, I'd rank this one rather low--simply because nothing of any consequence happens. It's a filler episode and did little, if anything, to enhance the overall plot or themes of the show.

While Quark is having family problems on Ferenginar Sisko is being set up by Jake who is playing matchmaker, setting him up with freighter captain Kasidy Yates. It looks like their date will end without them finding a common interest till she mentions she is expecting a message from her brother featuring a commentary on a baseball game played recently on the other side of the quadrant.While there was no action to speak of this episode had a good if rather obvious message about the stupidity of sexual discrimination. The story about Sisko meeting captain Yates isn't particularly interesting but does introduce somebody who will become an important character.",7

Quark is beside himself with frustration because she won't recant of her evil ways--and it's even worse when he learns she's actually earned FAR more than the Ferengi government realizes! The other plot is much less important--at least in this episode. It seems that Jake Sisko is trying to set up his father with a captain named Kasidy.

This is punishable by serious retribution and a huge financial burden to the eldest son. The byplay in the home between Rom and Quark is quite hilarious. Rom really grows a backbone and the two of them actually get into a fist fight. There is also a boring moment where the Captain of the freighter meets Benjamin and they, of course, hit it off.

Kira persuades him to enter into negotiations with the Kai but she betrays them by sending police to arrest him. Kira helps him escape and joins the former rebels as they head into the mountains to avoid the security forces sent after them. When Kira and Shakaar surround their pursuers but instead of attacking they approach the leader and talk him into helping insure that the Kai never takes political power.While this action in this episode was entertaining enough I don't find the episodes centred on Bajoran politics to be the most interesting.

3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Shakaar (TV Episode 1995)","Another one of ""those"" episodes","Kai Winn (Louise Fletcher) is, as always, deliciously detestable as a villain, and that's worth 3 stars. Nana Visitor and Avery Brooks earn another 1 star for this episode, just for doing their best with the lines given them. And that's where the positives end.This is another one of those DS9 episodes that would be embarrassing to show to a non-Trekkie, let alone someone who isn't into science fiction. Ninety-five percent of the main plot of this episode is explained through long, tedious dialogues about Bajoran politics, which, in and of themselves, are really hard to care about. Likewise, the sub-plot is about a game of darts, which is something that very few people can get into unless a) they are themselves playing darts, and b) there are pints of ale involved. The fact that this game of darts is ""on a space station,"" and that there's wagering involved, does nothing to make it interesting.Whatever (abortive) action there is takes place in the those boring southern California hills that I instantly associate with cheap production, and this ""action"" basically involves a bunch of walking and talking, culminating with some limply un-suspenseful, highly unlikely conflict resolution. On that note, plenty of things in this episode are unlikely.Avoiding spoilers, the charismatic rogues in this episode who we're supposed to root for are far from charismatic, but, regardless, they end up wielding great political influence; of course, everything important happens behind the scenes. This is one of two political shifts which occur abruptly, and their feasibility is explained only through dialogue. The sub-plot also resolves itself in an unrealistic and abrupt way, and unlike most other DS9 sub-plots involving Quark, it's boringly unfunny to boot.I guess this episode is OK to play as part of a series marathon if you're a hard-core Trekkie ""completionist"" like me who has it on in the background while cleaning his room.

Those Trill totally engulfed the Host personality, burying it. But the Trill, as well as a Makeup Facelift also get a ""Hostlift"" as their whole Species is re-defined in ways that make Jadzia and then Ezri in the 7th Season a lot more acceptable.And so Jadzia, and us by inference, get to meet all seven of Dax's Previous Hosts. When speaking to the Original Trill from TNG, you were speaking to the Symbiote only, and not the host. It is much better to have a Joined Species where there is actually a real Joining between each Host the symbiote has been implanted into: It shows that the Symbiote is not just using these bodies like old discarded clothing, but there is a real respect and care between the Symbiote and each subsequent Host.There is a slight problem when Jadzia has her tete-a-tete with ""Joran"" the host previous to Curzon who murdered someone from the Symbiosis Commission when they tried to extract the Symbiote from an unstable personality. Using The Sisko's body, he tricks Jadzia into lowering the security field so he can try to choke her to death. Fortunately for Jadzia and Sisko as well, Jadzia is schooled in the Martial Arts of Qo'noS, so she beats ""Joran/Sisko"" black and blue until Joran releases his hold on The Sisko.But then another problem erupts when Curzon is let into Odo's ""Body""- Odo Joins with Curzon, and starts acting like Curzon, fleecing a ""Tongo Shark"".Initially, Odo and Curzon want to stay joined, but that would mean Jadzia would not have access to the 80 or so years of Curzon's memories which give Jadzia her Unique Edge.In the end, Jadzia gets her Curzon back, with the added experience of being Joined to Odo, and she realizes what Joy Odo gets from being a ""Changeling."" Odo ""Became"" Curzon, who did have a Tongue, Nose and digestive tract. And one Host was forgotten: Verad from ""Invasive Procedures""-As we recall, in Season 2 Episode 4, DAX was accosted by a sniveling, bean counting pencil pusher named Verad who tried steal DAX and to escape to the Gamma quadrant.

The first few meetings go well but when Sisko hosts the murderer Joran Dax things go very wrong and he attacks Jadzia... this isn't the meeting that causes the most trouble though; when Odo hosts Curzon Jadzia must face her insecurities about why Curzon initially blocked her application to become joined. To make matters worse he and Odo announce that they plan to stay together which would leave Jazia without Curzon's memories. In a secondary story Rom is taking an exam to get onto a course that should help him get into Star Fleet.This episode might not have had much action but it was still pretty good as it gives us a further insight into Jadzia and her previous hosts. It was amusing to see Quark hosting a female Trill but the stand out performance was from Rene Auberjonois who played a combined Odo/Curzon; the linking had, unlike the others, led to a mixed personality and a change in his appearance.

Terry Farrell- who has not a thought in her hollow little head- once again commits a crime against acting with her typically vacant dissociative presence. Much more interesting is watching young and spunky Nog in his attempt to qualify for Starfleet Academy.Note to DS9 writers: enough hypothetical, imaginary, spiritual fantasy horse diarrhea.

They agree and the results vary quite a bit. One is an evil murderer and he only inhabits Sisko briefly (because he's so nasty), my favorite is a female host who inhabits Quark (it's pretty funny) and then there is Curzon Dax--who turns out to be quite the character.The other plot (and there are almost always two in every episode) involves Nog working hard to get into a special training program for folks wanting to get into Starfleet. While a minor plot compared to the one above, it was quite touching seeing him and his father-- especially with Rom being so very proud of his boy.All in all a very inconsequential episode since nothing earth-shattering occurs and it seems like filler, BUT it's also quite fun and great when it comes to character development.

Around the same time The Circle's activities start Major Kira learns that a Bajoran war hero Li Nalas, who was presumed dead, is in fact still captive on Cardassia Four despite Cardassian assurances that all prisoners have been released. Kira goes to rescue him along with Chief O'Brien, they have a little trouble with the Cardassians but manage to rescue Li Nalas. Once back on the station he is not ready for his fame and confides in Sisko that his fame is based on an event which wasn't half as heroic as his supporters believe. Sisko tries to persuade him that sometimes the myth is more important than the truth... this leads to Li Nalas getting an appointment that could have major implications for a member of the DS9 crew.This was a good season opener with good action scenes on Cardassia Four even if the planet was of the standard Californian desert variety. There was some nice humour too, Li Nalas's tale of how me killed an under-dressed senior Cardassian was both plausible and very funny.

But now one can watch the whole story in one sitting. In the first part of this story, Kira and O'Brien rescue a Bajoran resistance hero, Li Nalas, from a labor camp on Cardassia Four. Gee, the Cardassians lied when they said all political prisoners had been released; Gul Dukat extends to Sisko how appalled he is that the terms of the peace treaty were not honored. Concurrently, there is increasing political unrest on Bajor and it is believed that the terrorist sect called The Circle is behind it. The Circle becomes active on DS9 - at first it's just graffiti but it escalates to a physical assault on Quark and other acts. When Li Nalas boards the station he is immediately recognized by the Bajorans on the station and their adulation of Li Nalas makes him very uncomfortable. And he soon tells Sisko that his status as a hero is really unearned; he came a hero by a freakish accident and not by a display of extraordinary courage as the Bajorans think. The political leader of the Bajorans arrives on the station and warmly greets and welcomes Li Nalas. A good start to a fascinating story of political intrigue.

But Sisko gets more than he bargained for when Li is named his new liaison officer, leaving Kira's status uncertain as the episode ends.This is the first part of a multi-episode story arc to start the season. As such, it plays out more like the first act of a movie, with a ton of exposition and not much of an actual story. It ends up being pretty boring on its own. Li Nalas isn't a very interesting or charismatic figure, and the plot moves at a snail's pace throughout, with a decent action scene during the prisoner rescue as the only real excitement.THE GOOD-By far the biggest and best action sequence of the show so far. The shots with the squad of Cardassians charging over the ridges as O'Brien provides covering fire for the fleeing prisoners are well done.-O'Brien is great, as always.-The next episode in this arc is actually quite good, and probably part of that is getting the exposition out of the way here. As such, this episode has to be given some credit for the quality of the episode that follows it.THE BAD-I find it hard to care about Li Nalas or Bajoran politics-Bajoran/Kira ep-Slow plot with too much exposition and no payoff.THE UGLY-Rule of Acquisition quoted: 76th -- ""Every once in a while, declare peace; it confuses the hell out of your enemies."" 5 rules quoted for the series so far: 1st, 6th, 7th, 9th, and 76th.-The Boslic freighter captain comes back in several later episodes.-When escaping the prison camp, the runabout wouldn't be able to outrun the Galor-class warships. Danube-class runabouts have a top speed of warp 5, Galors have a top speed of warp 8. Due to the exponential scale of warp speeds, warp 8 is about five times faster than warp 5.

And, many of the Bajorans are now raring to kick EVERYONE out of the base and their planet!As I mentioned above, one of the huge problems is that two folks EASILY enter a prison camp and rescue Li Nalas--something that just doesn't make sense unless the Cardassians WANT Nalas to be rescued--yet NO ONE questions this!

Back on the station Li Nalas is feeling out of place as Kira's replacement knowing that he is only there because the politicians back on Bajor don't want a popular war hero there who might unify the people behind him. Odo is investigating The Circle and gets a lead concerning their arms supplier from a rather unexpected source... as he follows the lead he finds that the weapons are coming from Cardassia, at first it seems strange that they would be arming Bajoran nationalists but it makes sense; if the Bajorans expel all non-Bajorans they will lose Federation protection. When Kira is kidnapped from the monastery by The Circle Sisko mounts a rescue mission where he is accompanied by Li Nalas who is glad to get a chance to do what he does best.This episode does what DS9 does at its best; successfully combining action, character development and political machinations in one good story, it also foreshadows later episodes as Vedek Winn manoeuvres for a promotion to Kai, the Bajoran's spiritual leader, I'm not sure if it was planned at the time or just because Louise Fletcher did so well in the role that the show's creators wanted to use the character a lot more.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Circle (TV Episode 1993)","Bajor-Side Story, Part II","This episode as well as being great Political Intrigue is also important social commentary as to why Vigilance should ever be our lot: Ever since an unpopular regime in the United States was toppled in 2008, there have been those who would arm themselves and use domestic terrorism to cause a new Administration to Fail: On Bajor, this is The Circle which is plotting to overturn the Provisional Government. On Earth in 2013, it is the Tea Party, a powerless Political Party who unfortunately has powerful Cardassian-Like weapons providers backing them up. A Party which is just like Vedek Winn-Ratchet (Louise Fletcher) in their obsessive religious conservatism. And if we continue to watch DS9 - She actually does Gain Power. This frightens me as it should frighten every sane and educated American in the US- And so this Episode is a STARK reminder of what WILL happen when a person of too strict of conservative beliefs gains power over a whole Nation or Planet of free thinkers and insists that every person in their sphere of influence and under their governance take on similar beliefs - By LAW and GUNPOINT. If not for the counterbalance of The Sisko, the Emissary of The Prophets, Bajor would have been doomed.And so the question for both this episode and the similar events in 2013, becomes ""Where are these weapons coming from"" - As a SMALL group of ""Bajor-For-Bajorans-Only"" sect - Maybe even the Kon-Mah- Have suddenly been given the power to pull off an ARMED COUP. How? These events had their beginning in ""Past Prologue""- Why would The Cardassians in a Galor-Class Warship even ALLOW Tana Los to get near DS9? Because as we see here, they wanted him to get back to Bajor- If they had wanted to destroy his ship, then his ship would have been destroyed. Consequently, they knew that Tana's return to Bajor would in fact cause his reclusive beliefs to spread to more of the population.It is not the The Cardassians actually agreed with Tana Los - On the contrary. Their goal was always the return of Bajor to Cardassian Rule: In all Seven Seasons of DS9 and the last 2 Seasons of TNG.This episode was not immediately politically relevant in 1995-1996 when it came out, but even back then the seeds of this type of discontent had been planted. In 2013, these seeds have bloomed into an outbreak of Poisonous Weeds.The Solution is of course what The Sisko does here - Counter-Coup, Counter-Insurgence. The Sisko has to deliver the proof he needs to show what is left of The Provisional Government that The Cardassians gave The Circle the ability to pull this off, so that The Federation would retreat from Bajor, leaving Bajor and it's Prize, The Gamma Quadrant Wormhole and Celestial Temple of The Prophets unprotected and all Cardassia has to do is come back and take over again.But first two things have to happen: The Federation actually has to leave, which they have not done, and the Station has to be appropriated. Not on The Sisko's watch and certainly not while Li Nalas is the new ""Mavek"" - This is his chance to actually earn the glory he has been given, which he does.And the Military Governor who comes to take over the station, he is simply a Military Governor, doing what he is being ordered to do - But his immediate Underling is a member of The Circle - His Circle agenda interfering with his ability to see what is good for Bajor.On the Station, it is Miles Edward O'Brien who has to pack up every last bit of Federation Tech. And Non-Combatants must be shipped out, but many Loyal Bajorans - Those who are intimately connected to the Humans they work with - Agree to stay as does Li Nalas - And some stay not out of Choice but because Rom sold his Runabout seat- Like Quark.In the end, the evidence of Cardassian Interference must be given to the Assembly in time to Prevent Jaro Nixon from taking power and then giving Winn unprecedented religious POWER- But this First Minister Nixon/Jaro has blockaded the planet, which Leaves it to Dax and Kira to get through.So what we have here, is a scrambling, Odo scrambles to find evidence, The Sisko must get that evidence to Bajor at all costs.

The plot moves a much better clip and ends on a more suspenseful note than the first part.THE GOOD-I really like Odo and Kira's friendship. What they become later, not so much. But their friendship is really nice.-The scene where the members of the crew come in to Kira's quarters one-by-one and are having overlapping convos is great. It feels a little scripted and might have been better if the actors had been allowed to ad lib their dialogue more, but overall it's a fun scene with both funny and touching moments.-Watching the crew try to unravel the web of conspiracy and intrigue is suspenseful and holds your interest well.-The addition of Winn to the plot.THE BAD-I don't feel that the scenes of Kira in the monastery were necessary. Maybe it's because I don't like her romance with Bareil, of which the seeds are planted in those scenes. But I found the intergalactic political intrigue way more interesting than watching Kira stand awkwardly in the middle of a pond talking to people.-Jaro is way too cartoonish of a bad guy. Winn and the Cardassians make the plotting interesting, but Jaro does not.-Even without him knowing that the Cardassians were supplying him, I still find the stupidity of Jaro's plot to be too much to swallow. In season 1 it is stated repeatedly that if Starfleet left, the Cardassian would immediately reoccupy Bajor.

4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Circle (TV Episode 1993)","The annoying Bajoran saga, part two.","This is the second episode in a three-part series about the Bajorans and their power struggles. It is also the first three-part series in Trek history.When the show begins, Major Kira is spending time with Vedek Bareil. She hates meditating and he introduces her to the 'third orb' and she has some goofy visions. Then, the scene switches back to DS9 and Quark, oddly, is quite helpful in uncovering a plot by someone to arm Bajoran dissidents and help perpetuate chaos on Bajor--and considering how annoying and unlikable the Bajorans generally are on the show, this will NOT be hard to do! When the action (such as it is) switches back to Bajor, Kira learns who is behind some of the plotting against the provisional government (hint: he has a really cool voice). Overall, while I did dislike the Bajorans (as usual), it was a better episode than episode two--mostly because the Commander and his Starfleet staff began to behave sneaky and proactive. Interesting and it does start to get interesting here...that is apart from the silly religious visions at the beginning of the show.",7

The goal is to drive the Federation and all non-Bajoran persons out. This, of course, would make the average Bajorans vulnerable once again to the Cardassians. Kira is a soldier. I didn't like her at first, but she is a formidable entity. Due to political reasons and the Prime Directive, the Federation finds its hands are tied. But Sisko will do what he can without disobeying orders. This is a real thriller and I believe it goes on for a couple more episodes.",10

These arcs were premonitions of story to come: First we have The Circle, then we meet ""The Maquis,"" Followed by The Jem Ha'Dar, The Vorta, The Dominion, and The Founders. Where ""The Circle"" were easily defeated, The Maquis was not, and The Dominion was a threat elevated even higher. Even The Kosst Amojan (The Pag'h Wraiths) were hinted at, in Season 1 ""The Nagus"" where The Sisko tries to get Jake-o to go with him to ""The Fire Caves""-Which Keiko visited later, and got possessed by Kosst Amojan.This was a tapestry which was carefully thought out as they were making the show, and it paid off in spades, or, a Full Consortium (to use Tongo rather than Poker).In this part of the ark, Li Nalas (Richard Beymer from west Side Story) stays with The Sisko on The station, which is under siege by The Circle. The Circle was being supplied weapons by ""The Bloody Cardassians"" - Which if The Circle even knew about, would have stopped them cold, as it would have put Bajor back into the hands of The Cardies.But even the leader of The Circle (Minister Jaro - Frank Langella) does not know of the Cardassian Involvement, but nobody can tell him, he's got Bajor blocked off. So it is up to Kira and Jadzia-Dax to GET the proof of Cardassian Involvement to Bajor-If they can survive a flight with a Pre- Impulse ship.This is one of the highlights of the season, Kira and Jadzia's flight to Bajor, which has some of the best special effects of trek ever, we really feel like we are in the cockpit with Kira and Jadzia, flying with ""Seat of the Pants"" technology.Li Nalas is challenged by The Sisko, not to be ""Let off The Hook"" (meaning, being killed). In the end, Nalas gets himself off the Hook by taking a Disruptor blast aimed at The Sisko.There is one other thing that happens in this episode which is one of the best moments of Ds9: As Jake and Nog part ways, Nog asks Jake if there have ever been two people, so different, that have ever been such good friends, in the history of their two perspective peoples. That was a nice touch, that, and it was not used just once and forgotten, Jake and Nog's friendship lasted to the last episode of the Series - And Beyond that I hope, ""Far Beyond all those distant stars.""",10

All the new characters introduced for the arc are written out and things go back to the status quo, which makes the entire storyline feel rather pointless, unfortunately.THE GOOD-Dax is charmingly awkward in dealing with the world of Kira's resistance life. Their banter is the best part of the ep. ""I know, aim by the seat of my pants."" ""No you aim with your eyes not your pants!""THE BAD-The pacing of this ep is bad. It feels like some sequences are too long or unnecessary, while the ending feels very rushed.-All of the scenes with Sisko's crew waging guerilla warfare on the station were pointless. Nothing they did there affected the outcome of the story (except conveniently get Li Nalas killed). It seems like those scenes were written simply to fill time and give the actors other than Visitor and Farrell something to do.-Lack of consequences. We get no idea of what happens to Jaro. And there definitely should have been severe consequences for Sisko disobeying orders and violating the Prime Directive, yet none of those or any other likely consequences of this ep are addressed. Add in Jaro's absence from future eps and Li Nalas's death and the ending feels way too tidy, like a 90s sitcom ending. Plus it retroactively makes the previous three episodes feel pointless.THE UGLY-Odo shapeshift count: 2 -- a wall and a tripwire. 12 total shifts for the series.-Runabout roster: Back to 3.

2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Siege (TV Episode 1993)",Breaking the Circle,As the three part story comes to a close the action increases; as the Bajorans forces approach DS9 most non-Bajorans are evacuated although Sisko and the senior staff hide away in the crawl-spaces and await the arrival of the Bajorans. Meanwhile Kira and Jadzia are dropped off on one of Bajor's moons to find an old Bajoran spacecraft left over from the time of the rebellion. They need this as a Federation ship wouldn't be able to get near Bajor and the need to get there to present the evidence that The Circle was armed by the Cardassians.As the Bajoran forces take an apparently empty station the various teams of Federation personnel prepare to lure them into areas of their choosing where small numbers can be captured. Flying to Bajor Kira and Dax are intercepted and shot down but luckily they are near Vedek Bareil's monastery. Although Kira is injured she insists on being taken to Chamber of Ministers to present her evidence.The action scenes in this episode were pretty good and there were a few fun scenes too such as when Quark learns that his brother has sold his seat on the evacuation shuttle to a dabo girl and Dax's reaction to flying in the obsolete Bajoran ship. It was interesting to see Vedek Winn distancing herself from Jaro when she saw that his revolution was over and she'd need somebody else to advance to the role of Kai.,8

What an odd alliance. However, despite Sisko learning this, Admiral Chekote has forbidden intervention--so, Sisko is planning on intervening anyway! I like this side of Sisko and he is much more assertive and interesting in part three! Can the small company of Starfleet staff manage to resist this takeover? Well, perhaps if Kira can get the proof of the Cardassian involvement to the provisional government. However, communication with the planet are blocked and it appears as if The Circle will be ready to kill anyone trying to bring the truth to the planet. So, Sisko and his troops will just need to be incredibly tricky, won't they?This is by far the best of the three parts of this series--mostly because it does have a decent amount of actions--something oddly missing in parts one and two. Well worth seeing.",8
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Siege (TV Episode 1993)",A Really High Point,This is a highly entertaining conclusion to the first triad of DS9. Here all the forces that have been moving forward finally meet. Kira was remarkable. I especially enjoyed her trip in the old shuttle with Dax. It is comedic but serious as well. I also enjoyed the effort to confront the Circle invaders with a really good plan. Well done.,10
5,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Siege (TV Episode 1993)",Strong conclusion to very good trilogy.,"A Federation Admiral informs Sisko that they cannot interfere with internal Bajor matters and that DS9 must be evacuated. The evacuation begins with, however, a few volunteering to stay behind in order to give Kira and Dax enough time to inform the Bajor Assembly that it is the Cardassians who are supplying the Circle with weapons - with the express purpose of getting the Federation to leave and thus leaving Bajor defenseless. There are many good scenes in this episode, one of the best is how quickly Vedek Winn drops Jaro when she sees which way the wind is blowing regarding his future. We're sure to see more of her - she is so smooth and nasty. There's even a small bit of humor when Rom astonishingly outwits Quark much to the audience's amusement and Quark's annoyance. The special effects are good as are the action scenes. The conclusion including Li Nalas' fate is logical and was really the only way it could end. It was nice seeing Steve Weber as Bajoran Colonel Day; Wings is one of my favorite comedy shows. One thing I can't figure out is why Frank Langella as Jaro wasn't credited.",8

As they wait for the storm to pass a ship requests help but as soon as it docks the crew over power DS9's skeleton crew and make a shocking demand; they have come for Dax... not Jadzia though, just the symbiont which Verad, an unjoined Trill, believes should be joined with him despite being rejected from the joining programme. He is assisted by two Klingons and an alien woman named Mareel who he is in a relationship with. After the Symbiont is transferred to Verad there will only be a few hours to get it back to Jadzia or she will die. With the symbiont inside him Verad's personality changes dramatically; gone is the unconfident man we saw before, the new Verad Dax is confident and treats Sisko as an old friend while being cold to Mareel. This change of character makes Mareel realise she has lost the man she loves as much as the people of DS9 are losing their friend Jadzia so it is only a matter of time before she does the right thing.This was a pretty good episode, the highlight of which was seeing Quark attacking a Klingon... even if he was the one responsible for them getting weapons on to the station in the first place. Guest stars John Glover and Megan Gallagher were good as Verad and Mareel. Keen eyed viewers may also have spotted Voyager's Tim ""Tuvok"" Russ under T'Kar's Klingon make-up.",8

But by that time, she was married to ""Frank Black"" in MillenniuM.""Tuvok"" (Tim Russ) is a Klingon ""T'Kar,"" and John Glover (Who played ""The Devil"" in the short-lived series ""Brimstone"") is Verad, a sniveling Trill Initiate Washout and former bean-counter, who wants DAX, I mean, just the DAX Symbiote/Symbiont. Who are these people, and why are they on DS9? How'd this all happen?Welp, after the season 1 finale where Vedek Racthet/Winn tried to assassinate Vedek Bariel and the season 2 intro Three-Parter, which was actually a four part Arc, they had to cut some cost. So they gave Morn and The Other Ds9 Extras a week off, due to an uncharacteristic ION STORM in the ""area"" of The Denorios Belt. (Whenever Trek needs to clear out all extras from the Sets to cut costs, there is always an ION STORM.) During THIS Ion Storm, only the Ops crew is left on board: Picar Er, I mean Sisko, O'Brien, Kira, Bashir, Dax, Odo... and QUARK.Now Quark, in his incessant search for Gold-Pressed Latinum, sniveled his way onto being allowed to stay on The Station, but in reality was going to use it as an opportunity to get PROFIT. But Verad used Quark to get Mareel onto the station so she could beat up the entire Ops crew, which she was able to do after T'Kar forced Odo in a locking bucket.Verad was lucky, that Bashir was on board. He must have had this gig planned out, since the exact people he needed, Jadzia and Bashir, are left on-board at just the time he needs them.And so Verad forces Bashir to cut DAX out of Jadzia. Jadzia now has 96 hours to live, and the Ops crew has that much time to get Odo out of his locking bucket, cos he's the only one who can kick Mareel's arse, and she can beat up everyone else. So, it's your basic power-play, and Countdown-Timer on a drama.Verad/Dax tries to ""befriend"" The Sisko, but The Sisko will not have it. The Sisko uses the opportunity to reveal to Mareel, that this is not the Verad she was in love with: As Verad changes their plans after he is Joined to Dax. Verad/Dax intends to go to the Gamma quadrant, basically cos he knows that The Trill government AND Starfleet will never stop hunting him in the Alpha Quadrant.The highlight of this show was Megan, who did a great job of being Veronica Lake on Steroids. In the end, The Sisko talks her into doing the right thing and helping them stop Verad: as she KNOWS if she allows Verad to leave, she'll lose him forever, and Jadzia will die, and this will be the Last Dax Ever.It was all Quark's fault, Ya Know? He was the one who opened the locked Docking Port, allowing Verad's ship to dock with no Security Measures in place. But Quark Acquits himself pretty well, when he breaks open Odo's ""Prison"" - 'It's a gift,"" - This is the first chink in The Ferengi Armor, the first appearance of his being affected by Hoo-Mans. From here on, Quark tries his best, but he now has a conscience.As DS9 used up their budget especially on ""The Siege"" which has a lot of Odo shape-shifting effects, and some beautiful special effects when Dax and Kira are flying in the Pre-Impulse ship to Bajor, that broke the budget and they had to do this one show with limited Station personnel. But if you can get past the unlikeliness of an Ion Storm in The Denorios belt, then this episode is an enjoyable drama, and has some Quark-Humour as well.Verad was forgotten, when Jadzia had her Zhian'tara.",10
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Invasive Procedures (TV Episode 1993)",Grand theft symbiote,"I found ""Grand Theft Symbiote"" (also known as ""Invasive Procedures"") to both an interesting concept for an episode AND inconsistent and poorly written! It begins with a crack team entering the space station and kidnapping Jadzia Dax while the shocked crew watches helplessly. The plan is to STEAL Dax and implant it into a loser from the Trill planet who is bummed since he wasn't chosen for implantation! This is the interesting part. However, I was surprised when they showed the transfer occur--it was described as painful and the guy playing the thief acts like it's really painful. This is a surprise because in the first show about the Trill, Commander Riker is briefly implanted and he described it as being painless and seemed to enjoy the joining. Even more perplexing is the new Dax--he SHOULD have been the old one bonded with a jerk. Yet, oddly, there's very little of Dax's morality and decency in this guy and he seems quite willing to run off with his new host. Huh?! Did much of this make sense? Not really...and that's why I'm giving this episode a well deserved 4. A word to the writers-- next time research your characters better.",4
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Invasive Procedures (TV Episode 1993)","Good Characters, Bad Tropes","2.04 ""Invasive Procedures""The station has been evacuated of everyone except the senior staff and Quark, when a team of hostile bandits board the station and take them all prisoner. It turns out that the bandits were hired by their Trill leader, Verad, because he wants to steal Jadzia's symbiote for himself.Even though this is a terrarium ep, it still turns out pretty well. All of the main cast are allowed moments to shine, and the tension over Jadzia's fate is palpable.THE GOOD-Dax-centric ep for the first time since her eponymous episode, which is a nice change of pace for a character who was seriously neglected for most of the first season. However, just like in the aforementioned ep, she plays a very passive role here, which is less than ideal.-Each main character gets at least one good moment. Surprisingly, my favorite is when Kira says with a smirk on her face, ""If Odo is free, you'll never get off this station,"" because of how true it is. Odo is such a beast.-John Glover, who would go on the play Lionel Luthor in Smallville, is good here as Verad--both as the mousy pre-joining Varad and as the confident Verad Dax. The quality of the guest stars on DS9 continues to impress me.-A fascinating look into Trill joining.THE BAD-Fairly low stakes terrarium ep.-The bandits started out with an impressive execution of their plan. Their intel was very good; they are careful, thorough, and efficient in taking and holding the crew prisoner; and the detail of locking Odo up in the stasis pod was clever. But as the ep proceeds, their vigilance goes downhill into unbelievably sloppy territory that is hard to reconcile with their initial professionalism. I could understand them getting lax if the crew was putting up no resistance, but multiple times the crew tries to physically overpower them and yet the bandits continue to grow more lackadaisical in their attitudes.This is a bad trope, where the villains are introduced as extremely competent in order to put the heroes in real danger, but then become inexplicably incompetent over the course of the story and allow the heroes to beat them.THE UGLY-We get Tim Russ in his second of four Trek appearances here as the Klingon T'Kar. Thankfully, this time his face is encased in a latex mask, so it's not painfully obvious that it is him. Russ is a good actor and I'm glad he eventually got his deserved starring role--even if it was on Voyager.-Odo shapeshift count: 2 -- turns to goo to enter the invader's containment pod, then shifts from a metal cart to his humanoid form. 14 total on-screen shifts for the series.-Reverse Hulk Kira: she gets beat up by another petite(ish) woman. Apparently her hulk powers only work when she is fighting much larger opponents. And then later on she also almost loses a fight to Tim Russ's Klingon character. Only when Odo steps in and helps does she end up winning. It obviously doesn't count as a hulk-out, since she would have lost without his help. Maybe plasma storms neutralize her hulk powers...-I guess that Quark gets away with his actions in this ep because he ends up playing a key role in saving Jadzia, so the crew forgives him? Still seems a little shaky. Maybe I should have been doing a running ""Quark faces no consequences"" count in my reviews. It seems to be a serious issue with the otherwise sound premise that DS9 is a show that deal with the consequences of its characters' actions.",7
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Invasive Procedures (TV Episode 1993)",John Glover is the best thing about this episode.,"This isn't a particularly interesting episode. There are no real surprises, and everything ends the way it has to. The best part is getting to see John Glover.Glover is a superb actor -- and one of the few queer actors who's public about it (his husband is s sculptor) -- we don't see enough of. He made a career out of playing subtle villains (""Smallville""), but you should see him when he has material to sink his teeth into.He had memorable roles in a Western film (can't remember the title), and a TV movie with Sally Field as a part-time prostitute (ditto). Then there's ""Meet the Hollowheads"", in which he completely vanishes into the part.John Glover is the sort of actor who will only be fully appreciated after he's passed on.",6

The Doctor, under duress, must perform the operation, but it alters the new host in such a way that his actions upset the order of things with his colleagues. Of course, there has got to be plan.

0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Cardassians (TV Episode 1993)","A very real world style plot, and Bashir gets hints of vindication.","I thought this one was pretty interesting: The ideas of children left behind after occupations or wars are ones we have seen in our own time and it was really daring for this show to go there. The idea of people using said children for politics was pretty rough but sadly a logical progression from the storyline of Season One and the history between Bajor and Cardassia we started hearing about in ""Star Trek - The Next Generation"" in episodes like ""Ensign Ro."" Season Two will flesh out the backgrounds even more.That said, a person can watch this episode without ever seeing one of those others and follow it pretty well.As the show goes through the plot, we get to see Gul Dukat (Played by Marc Alaimo) again, and get to know a bit more about him. It also covers the Bajor situation well, as the first season of DS9 did brilliantly across the entire season. We also get to know about another Cardassian who we will end up seeing a bit more of as the series goes on.We first met the fellow named Garak in ""Past Prologue"" which was the second episode of the show's first season. He was the only Cardassian left on the station, and had struck up a conversation and a ready friendship with Dr. Julian Bashir (The very talented Alexander Siddig.) Dr. Bashir had heard rumors that Mr. Garak (Garak insists it is not ""Mr. Garak,"" just plain, simple Garak) remained on the station to spy on the people there. Bashir is excited and tells his fellow officers, who sort of let it roll off (Terry ""Jadzia Dax"" Farrell has some priceless facial expressions when she is hearing Siddig's excited telling of it.) Well in this episode, right from the start, Andrew Robinson is back as the friendly Cardassian tailor, and things begin to pick up.Dr. Bashir gets portrayed at times as sort of wide eyed in the first season or two, and the idea of him thinking the local tailor is some kind of spy and buying into rumors while the more experienced Dax, Sisko and O'Brien shrug it off seems to be an extension of this. Except now we get to see Mr. Garak again, and in this episode we see a couple of hints that he may indeed have some talents that go far beyond his excellent sewing skills. We also see some wonderful work by Marc Alaimo and Andrew Robinson in their brief time together that indicates there may be a bit more there between them. It's just enough to set things up for... but no, I'll let you find that one out for yourself. I can't tell you everything, that just wouldn't be as interesting, would it? (That one was for you Mr. Robinson and Mr. Siddig.) The point is, the ""wide eyed"" Bashir starts to look a bit more right in his thoughts about the tailor, who again is friendly and nice as can be to him, and from here on out these two characters really start to pick up, not only as individual characters but as a duo. The young, humanitarian doctor and the enigmatic Cardassian tailor are becoming a team of sorts, and now those more experienced officers begin to pay a bit more attention to them. Bashir also shows his willingness to risk his reputation and risk honking off people in command to do the humanitarian thing for the Bajorans and Cardassians involved. He comes out of this episode a bit stronger than he went in, in several ways. Avery Brooks is solid as Commander Sisko, and the rest of the cast is fine as always.As for what happens in the episode, I won't spoil things further, it was pretty well done and a nice character study with good writing and great work all around from the guest actors as well as the regulars. As for the friendly, helpful tailor, he and Dr. Bashir will again have some conversations in the upcoming episode ""The Wire"" near the end of this season (Season Two.) After that one neither one of those guys looked back.As for ""Cardassians"" it is pretty good and worth a look. It is more driven by character than effects, and when you have good characters with good writing and acting that can really work. This one, being a DS9 episode, has all of the above going for it. Worth watching.",9

As the two of them are enjoying a meal a Bajoran arrives with a Cardassian child. When Garak goes over to say hello to the child but ends up getting bitten by the boy. No sooner has the incident been reported to Commander Sisko than he gets a message from Gul Dukat on Cardassia saying it is time that orphans left on Bajor after the occupation to come back. The problem is the boy doesn't see himself as Cardassian, in fact he has been brought up to despise his own race. While the decision is being made he is put in the care of Chief O'Brien and Keiko. It turns out the boy isn't actually an orphan, his father, a senior Cardassian, believed him dead after an attack on his house. This father understandable wants his child back as much as his adoptive father wants to keep him. While Sisko must decide what to do with the boy Bashir and Garak head to Bajor to find the records of the adoption and discover why Dukat is so interested in the case.Andrew Robinson steals the show as Garak, it is not surprising that the creators brought him back after his single episode in the first season.

He is hostile toward his own race because of the persecution he has received in society and the history Cardassian cruelty.

But Rugal claims not - And so this sets Garak on a small investigation of his own, for which he obtains the midnight assistance of Doctor Bashir and a Runabout to Bajor, where he looks into why this Child, or any Cardassian Children for that matter would be left on Bajor after the end of the Cardassian Occupation? Apparently Rugal had been adopted by Proka as a small boy. As much as Proka professes his love for Rugal, ""Plain Simple Garak"" discovers malicious intent. It seems that Rugal's biological, Cardassian Father ""Kotan Pa'Dar"" (Robert Mandan of ""Soap"") is a Cardassian Political Leader - And as it turns out, Gul Dukat's Political Rival- And it was Gul Dukat that made sure Rugal was lost in the first place.This ep Explores the Cardassian and Bajoran family customs as well as Keiko O'Brien's propensity to eat bizarre and oddly coloured ethnic foods (and apparently ENJOY them!). It is the welcome return of Andrew Robinson to Deep Space Nine. Or should I say, Deep Space Slime?

That event triggers a series of political machinations involving Gul Dukat and a custody battle over the boy between his adopted Bajoran parents and his biological Cardassian father, with Sisko arbitrating and Bashir and Garak working to figure out what is really going on.This is an absolutely fantastic episode. The acting and dialogue are off the charts great, which is to be expected when both Dukat AND Garak appear in the same episode. The stakes are high, the political maneuverings are complex and interesting, and the consequences are profound. This is essentially a perfect DS9 episode.We also get our first glimpse of the hatred and rivalry that exists between Dukat and Garak. The glee that Garak shows while knocking Dukat down a notch is beautiful, and the long hard stare they exchange when Dukat knows Garak has beat him is one of the best parts of an episode that is filled with great parts. You are left with a feeling of satisfaction, while also knowing that this is a story that is FAR from over.On another note, even though O'Brien was forced to confront his racism once already in TNG's ""The Wounded,"" we see here how he still hasn't gotten over his hatred of the ""bloody cardies,"" and considering what he went through in the war with them (and what they inflict on him in some later episodes of the series), it's doubtful he ever will totally get over it. Keiko is right in a sense to call him out for his hateful comment, but she also shows a distinct lack of understanding for what her husband has had to endure in his life. Her cushy life as a Federation botanist and schoolteacher does not qualify her to judge Miles for reacting the way he does after the horrors he has witness and been a part of in war, and she should be slower to judge and quicker to empathy for him.That said, it's very powerful to see him struggle with his racism. He knows it's wrong to judge an entire race based on the actions of some individuals (he even tells Rugal that, almost like he's reminding himself), but he's been so strongly affected by what he has experienced that he can't help his racist reactions. It really gives the character an incredible amount of depth and humanity, and is a big part of why I think O'Brien is the most relatable, real, and likable of all the characters in Trek lore.O'Brien's struggle also highlights the best part of science fiction as a genre--it can address real world issues that would otherwise not be permitted to be discussed honestly. If you tried to write an episode of television set on Earth that addressed racism with the same honesty that this episode (and ""The Wounded"") does, you would get instantly burned at the proverbial stake by the forces of political correctness. ""All racists are evil people, period,"" is the dogmatic teaching of modern political correctness (to which Hollywood is enslaved), and any message that deviates from that is not permitted. But because the setting here uses fictional races in a far distant fictional setting, racist motives and feelings can be examined honestly without the PC police persecuting everyone involved. This is yet another reason why this episode gets a perfect score--it addresses important social issues in an open and honest way that only science fiction is capable of doing.THE GOOD-So many amazing scenes. The opening and closing scenes of Bashir and Garak talking in the Replimat, Garak fixing the computer on Bajor (""It's no more difficult than sewing on a button""), O'Brien with Rugal in his quarters, the arbitration scene, etc. There's too many great moments to go into them all in detail, but the best one is the scene in ops with Dukat talking to Bashir and Sisko over the viewscreen. The way Bashir and Dukat exchange dialogue there (as well as in the arbitration scene), each trying to outmaneuver the other with words, is like watching chess masters battle each other. Absolutely top notch.-Oh also: ""Don't apologize, it's been the high point of my day. Don't. Do it. Again."" I freaking love Sisko.-Acting, writing, directing, pacing, suspense, mystery, dialogue, and intrigue are all flawlessly executed.-Alexander Siddig has already improved his acting immensely since season 1. Here he effectively holds his own against the great performances of Marc Alaimo, Andrew Robinson, and Avery Brooks. A+ job by him.THE BADNothing to note hereTHE UGLY-10 million Bajorans murdered during the hundred-year occupation is pretty mild by the standard of Earth's authoritarian regimes. The Nazis killed 12 million in only 15 years, and Stalin's communist regime murdered 20 million over the course of 30 years. And those regimes only ruled over areas containing fractions of the world population--Cardassians occupied an entire planetary system for far longer and killed fewer people. Maybe they should have hired IBM?-It's easy to overlook in the details of this complex plot, but we can infer that the character Zolan was hired by Dukat to lure Rugal and his father to the station and then make up lies about how Rugal was being mistreated. That also explains how Dukat immediately knew that Rugal had attacked Garak--Zolan notified him. Although why exactly Rugal needed to be on DS9 for the plan to work is unclear, and that part ended up being Dukat's downfall since it drew Garak into the plotting.-Bashir retcon watch (WARNING: this section contains major spoilers for a future story arc): there are times in this episode where I feel like I can see Bashir flipping a switch from ""pretty darn smart"" to ""superhuman genius."" I know it's just in my mind because the showrunners had no idea yet that they were going retcon Bashir in a genetically engineered supergenius, but his dialogue scenes with Dukat it almost looks like he decides to stop pretending briefly and just unleash the full force of his intellect on the Gul.",10

When Melora, a new crew member, is stationed to DS9 Dr. Bashir has to make some preparations as the new ensign is from a low gravity planet so need special equipment to move in the relatively high gravity on the station. At first she comes across as rather brusque, objecting to anything which could be seen as special treatment due to her mobility problems even when some of those things have more to do with her only being an inexperienced ensign rather than her disability. The doctor is determined to get her to see that people want to treat her as an equal so invites her to dine with him at the new Klingon diner. As they get closer he suggests a medical procedure which over time will lead to her coping with standard gravity, the cost would be that she wouldn't be able to enjoy zero gravity the way she does currently.In a secondary story an old acquaintance of Quark turns up on the station and is out for revenge because Quark left him to spend eight years in a Romulan gaol. Quark tries to pay him off with the proceeds of a deal but his old friend decides to take the money and the goods and forces Dax and Melora to take him and Quark through the worm hole to the Gamma Quadrant. Here Melora manages to turn off the shuttle's gravity and overpower the hijacker.The main story wasn't too exciting although Quarks side story was fun and the episode had a few good laughs, best of which was seeing Melora argue with the Klingon about the quality of his food.",7

While in the 24th century most disabilities have been eliminated, Melora is an unusual circumstance. She is from a planet with no gravity and because of this, moving on normal Earth gravity is almost impossible. So, while she can move about normally at home, she's stuck in a wheelchair- like device because she's serving with Starfleet. Dr. Bashir is fascinated by her and tries hard to make her feel welcome. However, he and the rest of the crew are a little put off with Melora's strong independent streak--so independent that she rebuffs normal politeness and procedures as she sees them as patronizing towards her and her disability. Can Melora manage to fit in with the crew? And, what about her budding relationship with the Doctor?I liked this episode because Melora is not to be pitied and doesn't want to be. But, at the same time, the show seems pretty realistic and avoids being patronizing. A good job in most every way. HOWEVER, the show is frustrating as well because this very interesting character becomes a HUGE love interest with Dr. Bashir-- --yet, inexplicably, this disabled character is NEVER seen again on the show nor do they explain why the Doctor struck out at love once again. WHY?!?!",8
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Melora (TV Episode 1993)",Low Grav Woman meets Beak-Man,"""Melora"" was a character idea they had for the series, they wanted one character from a Low-Grav world. So they thought up ""Melora"" for this. Ultimately, having such a character was not cost effective, especially with a Shapeshifter/Changeling in the cast (Odo).So, to keep costs within reasonable boundaries, the Melora character was removed from the cast of weekly characters. This show however, lets us see how that would have worked.Melora (Daphne Ashbrook from Dr Who) is from a world which has a greatly reduced gravity-The Humanoids who live on that planet can take advantage of this by literally being able to float around.Melora has to use prosthetic help to be able to get around in the higher gravity environment of The Station, and she makes it very clear she does not want one iota of assistance from anyone, and she holds everyone at as much arms length as she can. Bashir is the first person to try to crack this armor, and he is shot down rapidly. But he is not a man who gives up readily, he keeps pounding away until chinks in her armor appear.Meanwhile, one of the countless people Quark has made enemies of has come on to the Station, and makes it clear he is there to kill Quark. This guy has a kind of ""Beak"" and he acts like a predatory bird. Quark tries to buy him off, but that just makes the guy mad and even more willing to kill Quark.Bashir finds some 30-year old research that would allow Melora to walk around in the higher gravity of the Station, it is not that she is too weak to walk in Earth Gravity, but that her nerves simply do not work right in the higher gravity. The treatment would allow her to walk around without her Gravity-Suit. But there is a drawback, the change would be permanent and she would not be able to go back to her planet.As she is there for one simple experiment, she has been using the Runabout with Dax. On the way back into the Station, Dax and Melora come face to Face with Quark's Problem, which has just gotten worse: And so Quark's nemesis kidnaps them all including Melora.This is one of those episodes where everything just kind of Gestalts, if Bashir had not started the Treatment on Melora, something bad would have happened on the Runabout. So the two story lines, Quarks problem and Melora's choices, all come head to head and allow for a resolution.This is also the first appearance of the Klingon Chef played by Ron Taylor, there is a short scene where Melora orders food in Klingonese and wins the respect of the Chef.Quark on the other hand, is once again out almost 200 bars of Gold- Pressed Latinum... As Usual.",10

She must use stabilizing braces and a wheel chair because she can't handle ""normal"" gravity. She is feisty and independent, but Bashir breaks through and eventually gives her an incredible gift.

However, no one knows that Pel is actually a woman--a woman who cleverly disguises herself as a man because unlike the usual docile and naked Ferengi women, she loves business and profit. This episode is important because you hear the first mention of the Dominion--a race that will become SUPER-important in future episodes. However, this sense of continuity you do not find with Pel. She is a very interesting new character and like most, you never hear of her again after the episode is complete. It's a shame, as I would have liked to see more of this gender-bending lady.

She must decide whether to take a chance that Odo will not turn her over to the Cardassians by telling him that she was really involved in an act of sabotage at the time or just hope the lack of concrete evidence will means she can go free. Back in the present Rom has an idea what the first name on the list might be and soon after a man with a similar name is found dead. It could mean the woman is arranging for the people on the list to be killed or if her bank account is to believed she is blackmailing them. if the latter is the case just what is she blackmailing them about and who wants them dead? This episode gave an interesting into Odo and his sense of justice, he will do what he thinks is right no matter who he is working for.

Nothing particularly special except that it allows for some character development between Kira and Odo.

Rom himself would say: ""Yes I am!"" - But we know better. So he helps Quark retrieve a box, even though Quark will get five bars of Gold-Pressed Latinum and Rom will get None.But ""Pallra"" really does not have 5 bars to give Quark - She just used the threat of Ooomox to get him to do what she wanted- The contents of the Box.Which happens to be a list of 8 Bajoran names.

Important enough for Pallra's enforcer ""Trazko"" (Robert MacKenzie) to shoot Quark with a ""Compressed Terrion Beam"" which he had smuggled into the station.The fact that this involves the old Chemist shop opens a huge worm-can for Odo, this is a case he never solved on Terok Nor when DS9 was Terok Nor and overrun with Spoonheads: His first case as a matter of fact.For the first time on Deep Space Nine, we get to see a little of how Terok Nor was during the Cardassian Occupation.Gul Dukat charges Odo to find out why there is a Bajoran body in the Chemists Shop, the body of Pallra's husband.

Then, the Skrreans show up from a planet in the Gamma Quadrant. At first, the universal translator won't work with the Skrrean language, but then suddenly starts working like magic. It has no reason to even be in the episode except to try and be funny? I guess? But it isn't. After the UT starts magicaly working, the Skrreans ask for help in finding a new home because they have been forced to leave their planet by oppressors and invaders. The people on DS9 of course sympathize with the Skrreans and are very welcoming and compassionate and offer to let thousands of the Skrreans stay on DS9 while they help them find a new home (Quark and his nephew are jerks to them but what else is new? They are always jerks! :P). The DS9 crew finds them a new uninhabited planet, but the Skrreans decide they don't want the new uninhabited planet the DS9 crew found for them, they want to be given land on Bajor. When the Bajoran Provisional Government refuses, for the very logical reason that their planet isn't in good enough condition to support 3 million more people - the Skrreans act like ungrateful jerks - as if DS9 HADN'T just dropped everything to help them and that the Bajorans WEREN'T actually looking out for the Skrreans' well-being as well as their own. If I was supposed to be feeling sympathetic to the Skrreans, then the writing didn't do its job, because they pretty much seemed like invaders trying to be the 2nd coming of the Cardassians on Bajor (or something like Europeans to the Americas).

On the planet they find a life form although preliminary scans suggest it isn't the same as Odo. Before they have been there long there is an Earthquake which releases a gas which has a negative effect on the Bajoran scientists and to a lesser expect Dax; it appears that Odo is unaffected as unlike the others he doesn't breath. The sample of the life form evolves at an amazing rate but disappears over night; either it escaped or somebody released it from the lab, either way the lab is heavily damaged. As they search the station it appears that Chief O'Brien has found it but what he has found is dead. When Dr, Bashir is attacked by a large shape-shifting creature it is clear that whatever destroyed the lab isn't dead. At this point Dr. Mora comes up with a shocking theory about what the dangerous creature is.This was a decent episode with some nicely humorous moments and a good mystery although the CGI looked somewhat dated by todays standards.

When his wife Keiko is told she asks to see the security recording and after examining it is convinced it has been fabricated as it shows her husband drinking coffee and he never touches it in the afternoon. This may be fairly flimsy evidence, certainly too little to confront anybody with, but Sisko and Dax return to the site, ostensibly to recover the runabout.This was an exciting episode which along with several others this series has helped develop the friendship between Bashir and O'Brien as they work together on the planet and discuss how Star Fleet effects relationships, something the two of them have different views on. It was nice that the motivation for killing those present at the harvesters' destruction wasn't that one side wanted to gain an advantage but that both wanted to make sure that all knowledge of them was destroyed along with the weapons themselves.

That aside, these two alien races have great haircuts but they become, again in guardians of the galaxy terminology, real ""A Holes"".One thing I notice with Star Trek, especially Next Generation/Deep Space 9/voyager/Enterprise, is that all of these aliens wear a kind of uniform, and that is precisely what is going on in this episode as well. The T'Lani and Kellerun have specific uniforms, don't any of these alien races have casual attire?Even with the Maquis, they also have a kind of uniform, even though it is closer to what casual attire would look like in the 24th century, they still have a touch of a kind of uniform that, when you see somebody dressed like this, you immediately identify them as being a member of the Maquis.The Cardassians, that's a different story, because everybody who is Cardassian in deep space nine is generally a member of their military or one of their covert operations like the obsidian order, so it is appropriate for every Cardassian to be shown wearing the uniform. But there are Cardassian individuals who appear on the show occasionally, who do wear unique casual clothing, like Mr. Garak, and a few other Cardassian individuals who are members of their government or old girlfriends of Quark. This is the only race that actually was shown to have individuals who wore casual attire rather than an entire species uniform. About it, when the changelings take human form, they choose to all look like Odo. But maybe that is for his comfort.But the two races in this episode are easily identifiable not just by their unique haircuts but by their unique outfits as well.Without giving away too much of what is happening in this episode, Dr. Bashir and Chief Brian are being pursued by these people for something that we really don't understand at this point. They had been helping them get rid of a dangerous biotech, but in the process chief O'Brien became infected.So they are on the surface of a planet within some ruins from a war torn region, and O'Brien is getting worse by the minute.Dr. Bashir has to use his rudimentary technological class from the Academy to try to rig a means of getting help, this was before we knew that he could have repaired the thing with hardly any effort, due to his genetic ""improvements"".You have to watch these episodes in retrospect, in terms of what we know about the characters later in the series, this was something that had not been introduced and of course at the time Dr. Bashir was keeping his abilities secret from everybody, for good reason. And, it is just more fun to not think about it too much until this is revealed later in the series.Keiko O'Brien, who knows her husband extremely well, notices something in a video transmission that eventually can be used to help save O'Brien and Bashir.

You can feel the tension rising, while you watch Miles O'Brien's environment on the station grow more and more hostile towards him. You and O'Brien really do not have a clue as to what is wrong, until the last few minutes of the episode. Colm Meaney at his best. Here is the story: ### Spoiler ### Miles O'Brien returns from a mission in the gamma quadrant. He was supposed to bring back security information from a war torn world to prepare the station for peace treaty negotiations between the two warring factions. Having returned to DS9, he experiences only hostility and suspicion from his fellow officers. He finds himself excluded and under constant surveillance. As things tighten in around him he escapes on a runabout and returns to the gamma quadrant to find answers on the planet where everything seemed to have started. As he arrives there, Sisko and Kira are already present together with two members of the local government faction. The situation escalates and O'Brien is shot and succumbs to a fatal wound. He dies, but not without seeing the real Miles O'Brien emerging on the scene before. One government member states that the rebel faction abducted and duplicated the real O'Brien and sent the doppelganger back to the station in order to sabotage the negotiations.I must admit, the ending shocked me. The ""fake"" O'Brien was just as real as the ""real"" O'Brien. At least he behaved like it. I do not understand how Sisko could have let him be killed, just because he was told by those aliens that he is a clone. It is very unlike Star Trek to shoot what one does not comprehend.

When the chief gets back to the station after arranging the security details for a peace treaty between two warring factions from the Gamma quadrant he finds that nobody is behaving normally. At first it is just little things; his daughter does not want a kiss, Sisko has got another officer working on the security details for the peace conference without telling him and he can't access all the files he should be able to. As things progress he becomes convinced that someone or something is effecting the crew. Soon he realises that he must get off the station if he is to find out just what is going on. Stealing a runabout he heads back to the Gamma Quadrant and makes a shocking discovery: it wasn't the rest of the crew of DS9 that had been changed, it was him. The Chief O'Brien we'd been watching was a replica, identical in every way but programmed to carry out unspecified orders at a given time.Colm Meaney did a great job as Chief O'Brien getting more and more paranoid as those he considers friends shut him out from doing his job and giving him manufactured tasks to keep him out of the way.

His daughter won't touch him, neither will his wife. That right there is enough.Even so, if that had been all that happened this O'Brien might have shrugged it off eventually. But that wasn't the end of it. Miles had been put in charge of high-security preparations for an upcoming visit by some Gamma quadrant dignitaries, ""The Paraden"". When The Sisko pulls him off of that detail and orders him to do basically a ""clean the toilets"" job on Deep Space 9, that's when Miles calls all bets off.This episode shows why Miles Edward O'Brien is just as good an engineer on Deep Space Nine as Geordie Laforge was on the Enterprise D or Scotty was on the original ""Enterprise"" (NX-01 does not count).When it seems like the entire Ops crew of Deep Space 9 is about to cave in on Miles, he widgets his way out of a tough situation and escapes to the Gamma quadrant.But why go to the Paraden home world? Why? What is there that is so damned important?Look for Leonard Nimoy's wife as the Admiral O'Brien speaks to on his way out, seen earlier in the episode ""past prologue.""The main premise of this episode is extremely similar to the main premise of the Gary Sinese character from ""impostor"", in fact the same thing is happening to O'Brien here that happened to the character in ""impostor.""I think a lot of the reviews I have been reading lately that have just been popping up in the last year especially, are completely missing the point of Deep Space 9. Deep Space 9 was not an episodic television show. No- it was one story from start to finish. That is how I watch it, and that is how I rate it. Not one episode is more important or less important than any other episode, because the storyline is entwined into every single episode. If you miss one episode, or dismiss casually one episode, then you will definitely miss something very important that will come up later in the series.

Unfortunately with storylines like this-- where a solitary person believes everyone else is conspiring against them-- it can only end in one of two ways: everyone IS in on it, which is often ridiculous (The Lady Vanishes, The Game, Flightplan), or the narrator is unreliable, which often feels like a cheat.This episode had the chance to find a balance when O'Brien runs a hypothesis by Odo, and the two discuss a completely plausible reason behind O'Brien's paranoia, but diverts from course back to having him an unreliable narrator.Almost a great episode, but winds up just being a sort of filler.",

The most angering parts are at the end, at her sheer audacity at telling the candle thief that he would most likely have been in prison which is ironic since this is exactly where her and her accomplice son are heading, and also the utterly unbelievable reaction from the rest of the colonists when all is revealed, who ultimately decide to stay. It is never pointed out to her that she most likely would have found people in the federation that were willing to participate in her experiment without having to resort to what is ultimately kidnapping.

Once on the surface they have a problem; none of their technology works due to a ""duonetic energy field"". When they meet the people on the planet they are told the energy field is due to local minerals and that they have been there since they landed ten years ago.

Rather than stopping O'Brien's search for a way to communicate it makes him more determined to find what is the real cause of the technology failure... when he does find it he learns that it was no accident that the colonists got stranded there; Alixus was determined to set up her technology-free utopia even if it meant several colonists dying in the process.This was a good episode with a good performance from guest star Gail Strickland as Alixus; she managed to play her as somebody believably obsessive in the belief that she was right and everybody else must follow her ideas.

Well worth seeing and pretty mind- blowing.",9
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Paradise (TV Episode 1994)",An excellent examination of the dynamics of a cult,"This is an excellent examination of the dynamics of a cult. I loved that it initially seems like nothing more than an ordinary, benign farming community and was gradually revealed to be a very controlled society run by an anti-technology zealot who was willing to let people die for her theories. Alixus is a great character with a very forceful personality. She has brainwashed her followers so thoroughly that none of them openly object to her resorting to torture in placing first Stephen and then Sisko in what O'Brien very accurately describes as a hell box. Alixus' actually quite frightening speech after Joseph defends O'Brien's attempts to contact the runabout to access the medkit and immediately before she puts Sisko in the box very effectively demonstrates both this brainwashing and her zealotry:""Thank you, Joseph. I knew you would feel that way and I'm glad you said it, so that all of us could see the true danger these two represent. Our very own Joseph defending what he knows is wrong. He knows that if we had spent our energy all these years trying to escape, we'd all be dead today. This is good. This is a test of our convictions, and we will survive.""Another more subtle moment which demonstrates her controlling attitude and her attempt to break Sisko comes when she says, ""Oh, will you be able to work your regular shift in the field today?"" The use of the word ""regular"" in particular struck a chord with me. Sisko had only worked one such shift but Alixus' very deliberate choice of that word was meant to serve as a stark reminder that he would be there for the duration and that he would eventually fall under her control. Thankfully, he proved her wrong on both counts.Rewatching DS9 has given me a new appreciation for Avery Brooks, who has always been my least favourite captain, in his quiet moments as Sisko. However, I still hate his shouty ones, I'm afraid. The scene in which Sisko silently returns to the box is a masterclass of subtle acting on Brooks' part and is easily my favourite Sisko scene so far. It is also an extremely well written scene which says a great deal without dialogue.Alixus' Luddite views are interesting and a very small part of me thinks that she may be right when she says that humanity has lost something because of its reliance on technology. However, a far greater part of me – about 99% — thinks that those sacrifices were worth it because of the great strides, particularly in the field of medicine, that were made in the 20th Century and have already been made in the 21st. Like everyone else, I have ancestors and other relatives who died young whose deaths could have been avoided just a few decades later. If this episode had not touched upon that issue with Meg and the mention of the other three people who died of the same illness, it would have been a major oversight so I am very glad that it did. Funnily enough, I had two power cuts in the space of three days the week that I watched this episode so I was thinking more about my own reliance on technology that I might have been otherwise.The ending is nicely ambiguous as it is not clear whether Joseph and the others want to continue the community because they think that hard work is good for the soul or because they have been so thoroughly brainwashed over the course of the last ten years. I loved that Alixus did not realise what she had done was wrong because she was so fanatical in her beliefs that it would not have rung true.Finally, I did quite like Gail Strickland's performance as Alixus but I was not too enamoured of it. She is certainly charismatic but not as charismatic as I would have liked. I'd have preferred if someone like the always wonderful Tovah Feldshuh had played the role.",

I get the whole bureaucratic emphasis on the Prime Directive and such, as well as the effort made for the main characters too look 'civilized' and all (who are they kidding though?) but it all failed miserably in this episode. First, there is no clear opposition from Sisko, other than useless verbal one at times; secondly, the colonists are way too docile to abuse; third, the cult leader's son unrealistically shares his mother backwards beliefs (young people almost always strongly reject these in real life); on top of that, the biggest aberration of them all, even after truth has been revealed, the resolution is way too mild for the gravity of the abuse and guess what, the victims would like to... continue their lives as nothing happened (not an ounce of outrage, no sense of injustice, no natural need to be reunited with their families at home, etc.)! As this wasn't enough, Sisko is apparently oblivious to the revelation that there is an entire network of cult followers doing the same things at the highest levels of the 'oh so evolved' Federation.Worth seeing the beginning for the premise, can be safely skipped if you're bothered by unrealistically nice behavior in the face of abuse and the 'herd instinct' type of resolution. The persuasive nature of the villain was expertly acted though - that's probably one of the few highlights of this episode, apart from the premise.",3

Their leader is concerned because members of their community have disappeared and they have no idea where they've gone! Naturally, the pair decide to help and discover that the settlement is REALLY unique--and I liked this twist. I also really liked the way the two interacted with the nice folks in this community--and it made this one a highlight episode.The other plot involves Major Kira in charge of the base's security until Odo returns--and how this all involves Quark is pretty funny.

We see an Odo that is humanized (as much as a changeling can be), caring, and empathetic. We can all sympathize with Rurigan and his need to create a Utopian society (even if it is not what it appears)..and who doesn't love a happy ending?This show asks us to consider what we call 'life' and what we want out of it. It should make us all appreciate the similarities we share as human (sentient)beings. The back story between Jake and Ben Sisko, allows us a glimpse into the personal lives of the characters and reminds us that they are real beings, and not just actors playing a character. In as much as a village of holograms are real, so are the crew of Star base Deep Space Nine (in their own reality).I found that the play between Major Kira, Vedek Bareil, and Quark to be unnecessary and simply used as 'filler material' which seems to be there, only to give the actors screen time.With all of that, i think you will find that this is a very satisfying episode that should tug at your heart strings and leave you feeling just a little bit better about life in general.",9

Once they have convinced him of their innocence they volunteer to help with his investigations.

While investigating the disappearances Odo befriends Taya, a young girl who's mother vanished on the morning of their arrival. When Odo Dax and Taya start to explore outside the valley they make a startling discovery about the village and its inhabitants.

When Arjin, an unjoined Trill arrives at the station he is rather nervous to say the least; he is there to be assessed to see if he is suitable to join with a symbiont and the person assessing him will be Dax. Previous Dax hosts had a record for rejecting a large number of applicants, he has no reason to think Jadzia will be any different. He gets a surprise when he meets her; she is busy gambling with the Ferengis and winning, he is invited to join but declines. When he turns up at her quarters the next morning is has an even larger surprise, the door is answered by a large alien who informs him that Jadzia is in the shower. As they get to know each other he becomes more and more certain that not only will she fail him but that she clearly should never have been joined herself. When on a routine flight through the worm hole their shuttle hits something strange, upon their return they learn that it is in face a proto-universe and that even though it is only a few hours old in our universe it may be billions of years old for the life forms detected in it. This means they must take it back to the Gamma quadrant, a rather hazardous task demanding the very highest flying skills; this is where Arjin proves his worth and earns a recommendation to be joined from Dax.It was nice to see some character development in this episode, Terry Farrell did a great job as Dax showing just what a sense of fun Jadzia has. As is often the case Armin Shimerman put in a stand-out performance as Quark; his speech to Arjin about dealing with life-wrecking actions was priceless.",8
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Playing God (TV Episode 1994)","More going on here, than just a Proto-Universe","The ""Proto-Universe"" subplot is simply a plot device used to allow us to think-About the next time we smash an anthill or destroy a beehive. Granted there are times to do both of those things, but when I was a child, we did not destroy beehives: We called the ""Bee Man"" and he would come and GET the beehive and move it to a place where it could develop without harming anyone. This is primarily what is going on in this episode, Jadzia and her Trill Initiate ""Arjin"" (Geoffrey Blake) have rammed into a developing ""Beehive"" - A Proto-Universe, in the Gamma Quadrant with a Runabout and have moved it from its environment, bringing it to the Alpha Quadrant where it is not supposed to be.We do not need to know all there is to know about this Proto-Universe: All we need to know, is that The Runabout piloted by Arjin moved that Proto- 'Verse from the spot where it was safely developing on its own, to a place where it would envelop our universe.We really do not need to know the Dynamics of this, all we need to know is that the thing should not have been moved from where it was.But what we DO need to know, is the interaction between Jadzia-Dax and Arjin. Apparently the Dax ""Symbiont"" (I'd rather spell it as ""Symbiote"" which is more correct, but all of my spell-checkers do not agree) has standards for Trill Initiates-Standards which Arjin is falling short of. Jadzia/Dax is simply trying to warn Arjin that he is in danger of not being able to meet those standards, but in doing so, offends Arjin and puts him on the defensive: Which was actually what Dax wanted.In this episode, we learn more about how Jadzia was rejected by The Symbiosis Commission, and was the first Trill in History to challenge the findings of the Symbiosis commission, re-entering the Initiate program and gaining joining with ""Dax"" - Who, when joined with Curzon, had rejected her application. We find out that it was Jadzia herself who requested joining with Dax, in an ironic gesture. We find out in a later episode, it was more than just Jadzia's tenacity which influenced Curzon/Dax to renege on his earlier rejection of Jadzia as a host-But this episode does not have time to go into that, that is a discovery for a later date. Suffice it to say it was a choice that Curzon/Dax deliberately made, for a specific reason.But this Proto'Verse is a problem: Kira compares it to an anthill, to be smashed. Odo on the other hand, ""Does not step on Ants""-But if they do not act rapidly, the Station will be engulfed.A further complication arises when Jadzia discovers there is energy being used up in the 'Verse that indicates there are life-forms living within it. Nothing is ever said about the level of intelligence of these life forms but we must infer that if they are using Energy in a non-random way, then they must be intelligent.After Arjin tells off Jadzia/Dax he proceeds to engulf large volumes of a blue alcoholic beverage. But he is a level Six pilot, and Jadzia, with all 300 years of experience, is only a level three pilot. And so she must ask Arjin for his help in piloting the Runabout back to the Gamma quadrant with The 'Verse in tow, which is ready to grow by another geometric progression.There are some very well done exterior shots, of the Station, where the Lab explodes and we see the 'Verse glowing inside. But my favorite shots are of the ""Verteron"" nodes inside of the ""Wormhole/Celestial Temple""- Which Arjin must pilot skillfully through in order to get the 'Verse back to where it needs to be, and what a shot! This was TV, in the classic sense, and those Verteron nodes were absolutely not CGI, as was the Runabout flying through them, this was all practical effects.Nobody needs to know, where they brought the 'Verse, I'm assuming that if they put it back in the exact spot where it was developing before, it would have developed in such a way as to not harm the Gamma Quadrant.The reason why their runabout rammed into it in the first place? Is totally unimportant. If this were a two-hour movie, they could have gotten into some of the scientific jargon which explained it. But as this episode was not really about the Proto'Verse, but rather about Dax and Arjin, it was only important how the two interacted to bring the thing back to where it needed to be, and the end result: Which was to give Arjin confidence that he COULD be joined, when his time came, and that Jadzia/Dax would support this, should he decide to pursue Joining.The Irony here, is that there is a ""Cardassian Vole"" infestation on the Station, which breed like Terran Coprophages/Roaches- And that is a recurring problem in the Station.But everybody else here is remarking about this protouniverse thing. That is not with this episode is about, not at all. This episode is about Jadzia pushing Arjin in the right direction.",10
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Playing God (TV Episode 1994)",Picard's epic facepalm is not enough for this one,"It's great that Deep Space Nine tackles such difficult issues that would be seen on a good ""Next Generation"" episode. This time around, it's a subplot involving a wad of ""space seaweed"" that gets stuck to a shuttle, and which they discover is a ""proto-Universe"" thing. Basically, it's a sticky ball of something that is literally becoming another universe.Real life science aside, this makes almost no sense given the infinite number of other universes in Star Trek. They have no beginning and no end, except when sealed shut by something or other. Argue this all you want, but it's not important.It turns out this proto-Universe is expanding rapidly, and is in danger of ""replacing"" our universe---as in, it will destroy our ENTIRE UNIVERSE and replace it with itself.Consider the fact that there are HUNDREDS, if not THOUSANDS of sentient alien races in Star Trek, in just ONE galaxy---the Milky Way galaxy.Consider the fact that there are a near INFINITE number of galaxies in our universe (or in Star Trek, just one universe).Consider the fact that there are likely to be an infinite number of sentient species in the entire universe.They CAN destroy this proto-universe. They won't.There have been dozens of instances in every Star Trek where the Prime Directives and Gene Roddenberry's pseudo-communistic ideas on the Star Trek universe have produced face-palmingly idiotic decisions, such as doing NOTHING in response to an attempted Romulan invasion of Vulcan, or doing NOTHING to save civilizations from extinction where there is no risk of exposing them to the Federation, simply because it involves putting some effort into trying to save them.But for the ENTIRE UNIVERSE AS WE KNOW IT to be threatened with PERMANENT AND TOTAL DESTRUCTION, by a proto-universe that is developing single-celled organisms, and having the Deep Space Nine crew REFUSE to outright destroy it while it's small...That is a war crime. That is a crime against humanity. That is a crime against all living things.Of course, this being Star Trek, there's always the Magic Reset Button that will alleviate this problem without any tough decisions or consequences to live with.But the mere fact that an entire subplot of this episode was focused on the DS9 crew being adamantly AGAINST destroying a proto-Universe TO SAVE THEIR OWN UNIVERSE is just... beyond all possibly justification. It is idiocy on a level beyond stupid Star Trek episode, the sort of thing that would make ""Spock's Brain"" look good.The worst part is that it's just a SUBPLOT in a forgettable Season 2 episode of Deep Space Nine.",1
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Playing God (TV Episode 1994)",Response and review- Contains Spoilers,"I am going to ignore the primary plot about the trill initiation as well as the sub plot about Jake Sisko dating a dabo girl.Rather, I will point out a misrepresentation made in one review above: At no time did that episode claim that the ""proto-universe"" (real physics aside) was only developing single celled life forms. Kira implied it. However, the analysis performed by Dax showed massive energy consumption and non random energy usage- Demonstrating heavily that a very large civilization (Most determinately intelligent life) was at work. The moral dilemma faced by Sisko was the idea (As clearly stated) of destroying a Civilization to save his own. Not single celled organisms. The individual the wrote the review above was clearly not paying any attention to that discussion in the show. Now that that correction has been covered, it demonstrates far more heavily why this is an Awful bit of story-telling.Here is this expanding proto-universe within our own that will engulf our own and destroy us all... A Major Moral Dilemma faced: To destroy a civilization to save our own OR to somehow find some amazing way to save both... And the end resolution was to... Take it back to where they found it in the Gamma Quadrant and drop it off In Our Universe? How does THAT simplistic and completely absurd ""resolution"" make any sense at all? That ""resolution"" leaves it to destroy our Universe - yet this problem is conveniently ignored by the writers. The problem was never resolved at all, the moral dilemma was suddenly forgotten and the opportunity to cover the fundamentals was swept under the rug by the same writers who gave themselves that opening in the first place. Whatever moral ground they wished to cover was completely wasted with that juvenile story-telling.",2

The most significant event is a mass of space ""seaweed"" that contains a new universe, that is expanding and could threaten the known universe. How to get rid of it? Alas.

And if you make up your own ending in your head, it works.The idea is great. A proto-universe that's expanding, threatening to devour our own. Now, there's no explanation where it came from, and the fact it just happened to stumble upon the runabout does challenge our suspension of disbelief, but as a basis for Star Trek kind of philosophical questions, it is as good as it gets: How can you decide the destruction of an entire universe? The doubts for the crew begin when they discover life in it, but that, I think, isn't even necessary. The fate of a universe in your hands - this is as heavy a responsibility as you can imagine. There are two directions it could go from there: either let Commander Sisko become death, destroyer of worlds, or find a treknobabbling way to return it back where it came from - personally, I would find the first much better dramatically, not the least because as I said, we are never told where it came from. Somehow, neither option is actually chosen. Instead, we are left with a ""yay, we returned it to the other side of the wormhole"", as if that is a solution. They could have said that the analysis showed that it is not going to expand beyond a certain (small) size, so leaving it in the middle of nowhere would at least make some minimum sense, but they didn't even do that.So all in all, this episode asks a profound question and then not only refuses to answer it, but reduces it to triviality without even pondering on it as much as it should. But perhaps simply asking the question is good enough - and even though I had watched the episode years before this time, I could distinctly remember Odo's retort ""I don't step on ants, Major"".

Until Now.It required THIS episode to bring out the Kurzon in Jadzia Dax. And so, we see these three Klingon Warriors- and hey, they've got Brow Ridges now! It was all Kor's fault, drank too much Brishanti Ale. But since we never really got to know the characters of these guys in their Original Trek Appearances, we have to invent how they would be, 25 years after meeting Kirk on the first Enterprise, and 80 years after that.In fact these Klingons have been elevated to ""Da'Har Master"" - I guess, the rank of ""Old Storytellers"" - I suppose, those who keep alive the Stories, the stories Worf would always teach Alexander. So they get to wear great Mullet/Poodle Haircuts and wear Furry Klingon Armor.But Kurzon-Dax was intimately connected to these guys... Apparently, somewhere in that room at the end of Star Trek VI - At The Khitomer Conference - Were all three of these guys plus Kurzon - Even though in a Brannon Braga Voyager Alternate Universe Flashback story Kang was near RuraPente at the same time. But that's No Problem, see? Cos Braga would just write another Alternate Universe Trek story with Time Travel to explain it. Hell, Braga's Trek Universe and Timeline should look like SWISH CHEESE by now and thank the dead gods of Qo'Nos he was kept OUT of Deep Space Nine.So what is important here, is not just the Joy of Bringing three beloved and hated Klingon's back - But that Curzon had made a promise to Kang - And Curzon was as Klingon as all three of those guys, to the point where that part of him even affected Jadzia.I believe in this episode it is brought up that Trill with Spots (Don't know about the Trill without spots, the ones from ""The Host"" in TNG) are not really supposed to get involved with Prior Life Relationships, people, or even Promises. But Curzon felt so strongly about this, he even caused Jadzia to agree to carry out his Promise.But we begin to see, even Jadzia loved Qo'nos and Klingons- The Love was part of her as well. The Sisko does not want her to do this, but he cannot stop her. He knows Curzon, he knows Jadzia.And so The Three K's with Jadzia in Tow plan a bold attack, Jadzia's Science background allows them a way to get into where this ""Albino Klingon"" is holed up. The Albino's head Alien guard is Chris Latta/Collins who was the Captain of The Paugh in Next Generation ""A Matter of Honour"".And so a GLORIOUS battle ensues, two of the K's are K-K-Killed. But neither Kurzon nor Kor do the Klingon Death Yell which Worf always does. Possibly because the Albino was not expected to go to Sto'Vo'Kor - And, they really did not eat his Heart.Jadzia comes back to DS9 as if nothing had happened- But this Jadzia which came back, was a much different Jadzia then the one who left- For the rest of her time on the series.",10

The interesting thing about this is that Curzon Dax was part of that oath Jadzia needs to join them. They fight her along the way.

When Benjamin Sisko's friend, Commander Calvin Hudson arrives on the station from the Cardassian Demilitarized Zone to assess the matter, it's revealed that all the Federation colonists in the zone have refused relocation out of Cardassian space and that they're all dissatisfied with the recent border treaty. We soon learn the colonists' belief that the Cardassian settlers are being armed by their Central Command through third-party couriers in direct violation of the treaty, while the Federation defectors are arming themselves through other providers (including Quark). After a skirmish in the DMZ involving Cardassian ships and converted Federation couriers, both sides deny responsibility for the situation to Sisko, Hudson and Gul Dukat; Cardassian attache Gul Evek going as far as calling the Federation colonists ""terrorists"" and revealing the corpse and recorded confession of a colonist responsible for the destruction of the Cardassian freighter. After Sisko returns to DS9 with Dukat, the latter is kidnapped by a Vulcan woman named Sakona who'd purchased weapons through Quark and taken back to the DMZ. The paramilitary group claiming responsibility for both the destruction of the freighter and Dukat's kidnapping is named over subspace - THE MAQUIS! In pursuing Sakona's Maquis cell into a volatile region of space known as the Badlands, Sisko discovers that Commander Hudson (who believed the colonists' assertions of injustice by the Federation and Cardassians) has shed his uniform and sided with the Maquis.The second part of the episode includes Sisko's reaction to Hudson defecting from Starfleet to join the Maquis, the rescue of Dukat and apprehension of his Maquis kidnappers (including Sakona), the ""official"" cessation of weapons shipments from Cardassia to the DMZ and Sisko's successful attempt to stop Hudson's Maquis cell from attacking a suspected weapons depot - all in the name of preserving the treaty.Though this episode and its second part hold up by themselves, it helps to keep in mind that it propels into motion a much bigger course of events. The Star Trek producers created the Maquis as a catalyst for Voyager, which would launch in the wake of Next Generation's conclsion, but their story was first brought to life in Journey's End, this episode and a handful of episodes to follow to establish a back story. And after Voyager's beginning, the Maquis presence on DS9 would unfortunately become superficial.",10

He is an old friend of Sisko's and it soon becomes clear that he is not happy with the treaty between the two sides that left several colonies on the wrong side of the new border. Surprisingly there is no official comment from the Cardassians although Gul Dukat turns up in DS9 and suggests that Sisko accompanies him to the border colonies. On the way they come across Federation ship which is being attacked by Cardassians who refuse to answer even when ordered to do so by Dukat. It looks as though the colonists on both sides are trying to start their own private war. When they arrive at the colony tensions are high; a Federation colonist has confessed to the destruction of the ship but as he is now dead and the confession was made after an interrogation the colonist claim he only confessed as he was tortured. With nothing resolved they return to the station but soon Dukat has been kidnapped by a Vulcan woman and a man dressed as a Federation security officer. While Sisko was away we had seen the Vulcan attempting to negotiate an arms deal with Quark.This was a decent episode which had an intriguing mystery and a nice cliff hanger ending. While the main story is good the scenes between Quark and Sakonna, the Vulcan woman are the most fun, he is clearly interested in her and she doesn't appear to be totally disinterested in him.",8

These folks hate and distrust the Cardassians and instead of making peace with them (which is the boring Federation way), they are in favor of confrontation and attack. Naturally, the Cardassians are not happy about the Maquis and their attacks but they don't complain too loudly. Why? Because through the course of these two episodes, it turns out that the Maquis is generally right--the Cardassians are lying scum who cannot be trusted. But Sisko and his crew are very duty-bound and don't quite know what to do--to side with their friends (with the Maquis) or the Federation?

Odo arrests Quark for his dealings with Sakonna and he is soon telling Sisko everything he knows. This leads Sisko and a group of DS9 officers to the site where Dukat is being held. With Sakonna in custody they learn of the target the Marquis are planning to attack, the question is how far is Sisko willing to go to prevent his friend achieving his goal? This was a decent enough episode although the Marquis didn't really come across as a serious threat; we weren't shown anything to suggest they were anything more than a dozen or so people with a couple of small ships.

Amazing to see the impact of Kirk's words to Spock at the end of the aforementioned episode and how cataclysmic the changes were when Spock had initiated a change on the way the Empire had ruled and eventually led to the Empire losing it's stranglehold over the Galaxy.

They don't have time to wonder where it might be when a Klingon ship appears and two warriors beam aboard. These two are shocked to see Kira aboard and are very deferential. They offer to escort them back to DS9 which is near Bajor for some reason. It turns out that the accident sent them to the parallel universe first visited by Captain Kirk in the original series.

The doctor and Major Kira must find a way to get back home, it is difficult for them to tell who they can trust as the counterparts of their friends are very different.This was a fun episode that gave us a chance to see how the actions of Kirk a century ago lead to the enslavement of humanity and the rise of an alliance of the Klingons and Cardassians. Nana Visitor did a good job as the two very different versions of Kira however I think Avery Brooks is much better as the serious Commander Sisko than here where he seemed rather hammy laughing like a pantomime pirate.

3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Crossover (TV Episode 1994)",Kira Nerys and Bashir in the Red Fringe 'Verse,"That is, if in fact this alternate universe is the same as ""the Other Side"" from that series.In Fact, the entire concept of Alternate Universes was brought up in the TOS Episode ""Mirror, Mirror"" - And that was a highly unusual concept for Television in those days. But as The Original Series episodes were always written by high profile and usually Hugo-Award winning Science Fiction Authors, it was not unusual for Trek in itself. Therefore, this episode is a big ""about time"" episode-About time they brought back ""The Mirror 'Verse"" to Trek.Add to this, that this episode is a 24th century continuation of the story that Kirk meddled in: This shows that indeed, Spock did take over the ISS Enterprise and became a pivotal figure in directing the Terran Empire toward a peaceful existence.But because of that, the Terran Empire became weak, and was overthrown by what we have here: The Klingon-Cardassian Alliance.This storyline was never investigated in The Next Generation, but here, it begins and becomes one of our favorite Deep-Space Nine story arcs, and is fit in to the general story of DS9 on several occasions.But here is the first iteration: Kira and Bashir are returning through the Wormhole and a thruster malfunction causes them to Cross Over like Olivia does in Fringe. They find the Station way over by Bajor, and they are escorted in by a Klingon Battle Cruiser.When they get there they are met by Garak and ""The Intendant""-Who is Kira herself!Garak is a Full Cardassian here, and Kira is the ""Intendant"" of the Station. She is fascinated by Nerys, but they shove Bashir in the Ore Processing Plant-The overseer is Odo, and this Odo is not very nice either.While Nerys entertains The Intendant, Bashir meets ""Smiley"" O'Brien, named by that Universes ""Sisko""-Who is a Pirate for The Intendant.But Bashir knows they are in the Mirror Universe, he is able to tell Nerys that she must get access a Transporter which they might be able to rig to get them back across. Bashir wants to get ""Smiley's"" help with that, but ""Smiley"" is a bitter man, although he is still a Mechanical Genius.Nerys Approaches Quark, who she thinks may help them for a Profit, but in fact Quark is willing to help them anyway-He helps to smuggle Terrans off of the station! But Quark is caught and killed by The Intendant, closing off that avenue of Escape. But now, Garak has his agenda he wishes to impose onto Nerys, so the prospect of escape becomes more important than ever.Bashir tells ""Smiley"" all about Miles on the other side, and this piques Smiley's interest, enough to elicit his help. Smiley causes an explosion in the Ore Processing Plant - And Bashir uses a Disruptor on Odo, splattering him all over, killing him. But they are caught by a Klingon-The same Klingon that was in the Next Generation Episode called ""The Chase""-He is overheard boasting about working for ""The Duras Family"" and he mentions Lursa and Bet'or. But this Klingon catches Bashir and Smiley and they are brought in front of The Intendant, most likely to be executed.All through this, the Alternate-Sisko may be a creep, but he is highly fond of Smiley: So, when The Intendant makes it clear that she is going to kill Smiley, Sisko ""Changes his Mind"" and paves a route of escape for Nerys, Bashir, Smiley and others. Smiley goes with Sisko, and Nerys and Bashir finally get back to their Runabout, using the same malfunction to get home. Fortunately, the people in the Mirror 'Verse have not discovered The Wormhole yet, and they are able to escape by the seat of their pants.This episode is great Character development — exploring the main DS9 characters by showing their Mirror Doppelgangers. And the fact that the Mirror Odo and Quark get killed, shows that DS9 was not afraid of really getting their teeth into the Mirror storyline and abusing it for all it's worth. A very effective episode, and one of my favorite of the series. The actor who reprises the Klingon role from the earlier Next Gen episode is not credited. Ironically, that Next Generation Episode had Salome Jens playing the Specter of ""An Alien Race from which most of the Humanoids had descended from""-Salome Jens was to become the Matriarch of the Shapeshifters, so that this episode reaches back and accommodates that episode from The Next Generation is very fitting, and provides a sort of continuity between The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine.",10

Major Kira, the highest ranking Bajoran on Deep Space Nine, has proved to be an insufferable moron for most of the series. Her part thus far has apparently been to be the fanatic of the ensemble crew.The problem with her is that she rarely, if ever, gets her comeuppance, in the way Quark would for doing less than she does.In this episode, it's revealed that a Bajoran collaborator has come to DS9 and reveals that another collaborator was behind a massacre of a resistance cell during the Occupation of Bajor.So Major Kira goes on a crusade to find out who it is, including at the very least breaking several laws, getting Quark to hack into the Vedek's security system, and finds out that it's potentially her lover, Vedek Bareil who was the collaborator.When confronted, Bareil admits it was him, and that he gave the Cardassians the location of the resistance cell because they were threatening to destroy several villages and murder thousands of Bajoran civilians.MAJOR KIRA WILL HAVE NONE OF THAT, THOUGH! She snarls and condemns him with the same amount of dogmatic narrow-minded insistence of a religious fanatic, not even bothering to give second-thought to her condemnations and anger given that he was FORCED AGAINST HIS WILL BY THE CARDASSIANS OR ELSE THEY WOULD MURDER THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT BAJORANS. To her, he's a collaborator, and that's that.So he takes the fall publicly, only for her to discover that it was actually Kai Opaka (the Bajoran equivalent of the Pope, who they left on a planet in the Gamma Quadrant to bring peace between two warring peoples) who told the Cardassians, because of the same reasons Bareil claimed, and because her own son was in the cell that she knew the location.OF COURSE, SINCE SHE WAS GREAT AND ALMIGHTY KAI, MAJOR KIRA IS NO LONGER ANGRY AND FORGIVES THIS ACTION! Perhaps ironically, producer Ronald D. Moore also created the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica, which had an almost identical situation in the 3rd season involving the human resistance fighters labeling collaborators as undeniable traitors and enemies of mankind, regardless of who they are or why they're doing it.This lead to Ellen Tigh ""collaborating"" with the Cylons in order to free her husband, who was one of the leaders of the resistance, in order to help the resistance.In Battlestar Galactica, this is handled with great drama, care, and realism, with the collaborators given genuine reasons for collaboration, ranging from secretly helping the resistance, to having no choice, to just being pawns and tools. The actions of the resistance fighters are treated with the proper level of disgust, viciousness, and barbarity, even after the occupation of New Caprica, when they begin targeting SUSPECTED collaborators, finding evidence, and murdering them without trial.By contrast, this episode handles it in purely black and white terms. The collaborators are bad and wrong, even if they aren't evil people, and Major Kira is good and right, even if she's breaking the law to uncover who was a collaborator.Idiotic.",3

While Vedek Bariel is a nice guy and clearly the person that the station members would like elected to become Kai, Winn is naturally up to something and is scheming to eliminate him as a candidate. Oddly, her evil schemes necessitate the help of Major Kira--an odd thing as she is Bariel's lover and truly hates Vedek Winn.

The great casting (and guests) were being utilized well beyond the clunky, immature, amateurish, simplistic first season. There's meat on them bones finally. Even the editing and pacing was vastly improved during season 2.

When Odo goes to Cardassia to defend O'Brien, the court announces that NO NEW EVIDENCE can be considered--even though Odo can prove that Miles is not guilty!!

Back on DS9 his friends are working to prove his innocence and Odo is dispatched to Cardassia to help with his legal representation.This was a decent episode although it was a shame we were shown the true culprit in the opening scenes which meant we knew the chief was innocent rather than just believing he must be. Fritz Weaver added some fun to the proceedings as O'Brien's defence lawyer who has never won a case and believes this is a good thing.,7
5,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Tribunal (TV Episode 1994)",One of the worst episodes of the season,"Everyone is out of character as this terrible episode attempts to drive home its point with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. The episode gets off to a rough start, as vacationing Chief of Operations Miles O'Brien attempts to get his Asian-American wife Keiko in the mood by playing god-awful ""ching chong"" music over their shuttle's sound system. Things roll sharply downhill after he's abducted by the Cardassians and trapped in a hideous parody of a fascist criminal justice system. The Cardassians devolve from charismatic, dangerously calculating militarists into children's cartoon villains who televise trials for entertainment and openly revel in their sham justice system. Meanwhile, back on Deep Space 9 the rest of the cast has apparently been replaced by doppelgangers. Sisko is infuriatingly passive, for someone who just had one of their officers abducted in neutral space by a foreign power. Odo and Bashir reflexively side with the Cardassians. Major Kira, of all people, immediately begins to suspect O'Brien's guilt and hardly raises an eyebrow over the Cardassian's outrageous conduct (which is itself completely out of character with their previously cautious dealings with Federation personnel). The narrative flow is terribly off as well. The main ""mystery"" is suddenly resolved off-screen without any prelude in the last 15 min. Half an hour is wasted constantly smashing the audience over the head with how grotesquely unfair the Cardassian justice system is. Honestly, this episode reminds me of nothing so much as one of the worse RTD episodes of Doctor Who.",2

The commander wasn't too pleased to have Nog and Quark along although as Jake invited Nog it was hard to say no and once on a planet in the Gamma Quadrant Quark won't stop moaning about the climate, the insects and the lack of anything interesting to him. The episode had a change of tone when an alien woman emerges from the undergrowth while Jake and Nog are away. She warns Sisko and Quark about the Jem'Hadar but before they can do anything all three of them are captured and the woman has a collar put on to prevent her using her telepathic powers to deactivate the containment field they are held in. When Nog and Jake realise something is the matter they return to the runabout and try to make their way back to the station, which is rather difficult as they don't have the password for the autopilot. Meanwhile back at the station a Jem'Hadar ship approaches and one of them beams into ops and tells them that they will not tolerate any further incursions into the Gamma Quadrant and that they are holding Sisko captive. As the USS Odyssey, a Galaxy Class starship is visiting the station it and the station's runabout mount a rescue mission, a mission that will teach the Federation just how dangerous the Dominion is.This was a great episode which introduced the Jem'Hadar and the Vorta, two species which will come to be amongst the main antagonists in later series when the Dominion is more than just a Gamma Quadrant rumour. I liked how the episode changed from comedy to drama midway through and let us think for some time that the Vorta were not part of the Dominion.

0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Emissary (TV Episode 1993)",Unprecedented and Unequaled in Scope and Complexity,"Deep Space Nine was the most complex, broad and innovative offering to come out of the Star Trek Franchise. Based on a space station near a stable wormhole leading through an inhabited inter-dimensional gateway into a different quadrant of the galaxy millions of light years away, DS9's aliens were REALLY alien, it's stories ranged from near-universal to personal in scope, and its characters and their relationships to one another were more intimately explored than before or since. Sci Fi TV has rarely, if ever dived so deep into the wellsprings of intellect and drama (moreso than the new BSG, TNG and Firefly - which is saying a lot) Central to the show's grand (7 year) story arc is Benjamin Sisko, the space station's brilliant but somewhat reluctant and disgruntled new commander. Sisko is also - possibly - a prophesied messiah of the people of Bejor: The Emissary. This story begins in the hour and a half long opening episode. Almost all of the main characters are also introduced, and at least hints to the most important relationships (Sisko-Kira; Sisko-Odo; Sisko-Kira; Sisko-Quark; Sisko-Jake; Kira-Odo; Odo-Quark and Sisko-Dax) are dropped.Among the many plots and subplots established and developed in the Emissary, the most important are Sisko's back-story. Our commander is a widower who to an extent blames the federation for the loss of his beloved wife, dedicated single father, and an ingenious officer. Unlike all of his predecessors, Sisko also has a goofy and even downright awkward side, which is very refreshing after years of the stodgily military Picard and the space cowboy man-ho Kirk.Sisko arrives at his newly transferred Cardassian space station and finds it in a state of chaos and disrepair. The ""Cardies"" apparently wrecked the place as they departed the station and the formerly occupied planet of Bejor, and all of the merchants are preparing their departure . Battling his own career demons, Sisko must find a way to put the place and its people back together while dealing with more than one race which distrusts Star Fleet's intentions, and - perhaps - along the way he will find some inspiration for staying with Star Fleet despite his numerous and profound misgivings.And I am leaving about 80% of Emissary's storyline out of this review intentionally.The special effects, script and directing of Emissary established the very high standard that DS9 would maintain almost perfectly in its seven year run. Although the acting in this first episode was occasionally a little stiff, given the scope and convoluted plot, and the newness of the complex characters which would evolve later in the series, I think this is understandable. The major exception regarding acting is Kira (Nana Visitor) - for whom this is one among many show-stealing performances ranging through the entire series. Recommended for alert and attentive TV watching.",9
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Emissary (TV Episode 1993)",Welcome to DS9,"This double episode provided a great introduction to the new series, unlike other Star Trek series it isn't set on board a shiny new space ship but on a battered former Cardassian space station belonging to the recently liberated planet of Bajor. On arrival the station's new commander, Benjamin Sisko, isn't too keen on his new assignment which is first since he lost his ship and his wife in a battle with the Borg three years previously. When he arrives he is met by Chief Miles O'Brien who shows him round the station and introduces him to the Bajoran liaison officer Major Kira Nerys who is distrusting of Star Fleet's motives. While talking to her there is a security alert due to a break-in in one of the station's shops. The two thieves are arrested by the station's police officer; a shape-shifter by the name of Odo. Quark, the uncle of one of the thieves tries to get his nephew released and Sisko says he will release him on one condition: he reopens his bar rather then leaving the station. This might seem a strange deal but Sisko knows he must re-establish confidence in the station's population if he is to be successful.He is soon summoned to the surface of Bajor by spiritual leader Kai Opaka who tells him that he is The Emissary of the Prophets and that it is his destiny to find the Celestial Temple, to help with this she gives him a strange orb which causes those who look at it to have visions. Back on the station he meets new Star Fleet arrivals Dr. Julian Bashir and science officer and old friend Jadzia Dax, who Sisko calls Old Man despite her being a young woman, this is because she is a joined Trill and Sisko knew the symbiont's previous host. He soon sets Dax to work studying the orb and this leads them to the sight of an anomaly which turns out to be a stable worm hole to the Gamma Quadrant. As the two of them return they find themselves on a strange planet in the worm hole; could this be the Celestial Temple? When the people on DS9 learn of the worm hole the race is on to lay claim to it. The Crew struggle to move the station to location of the worn hole before the Cardassians can get there as whoever can control that space will be in charge of a staging post for exploration and trade with the Gamma Quadrant.Being a fan of DS9 I'd seen the series a couple of times before I recently re-watched this episode; I think it did a very good job of introducing a cast of characters who with the exception of Chief O'Brien are new to the Star Trek world. These introductions are done in a way that doesn't seem forced yet shows us what each character's role will be. With the introductions out of the way we are quickly into the action which is fairly exciting. The cast all did a great job and it was nice to see a cameo by Patrick Stewart as Capt. Jean-Luc Picard.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Emissary (TV Episode 1993)",Very good series premiere,"Emissary was Deep Space Nine's pilot episode. And not a bad one either. A fitting beginning to a 7 year story.I don't think it was perfect, like The Next Generation's Encounter at Farpoint, but it did introduce all the characters and settings of this incredible show. Emissary reminds me of Babylon 5's Pilot Episode: The Gathering, which was aired a month after Emissary.Deep Space Nine's first couple of years weren't THAT great, but then the show started to rise with a great storyline and great situations, such as the Klingons' separation from the Federation, Sisko's destiny and the Federation's war against the Dominion and Cardassian alliance. And Emissary was the 2 hour series premiere that gave birth to all this. Emissary has a good storyline. Sisko's encounter with the prophets beat any alien encounters ever seen before in Star Trek history. Sisko's background related to the Battle of Wolf 359 as well as his meeting with Picard make the series an excellent sci-fi drama. Kira started out as the angry vengeful Bajoran and grew intensively over the past 7 years, becoming an incredible leader and fighter. I was astonished to see Miles and Keiko O'Brien becoming part of the show, which affected deeply their personal lives as they moved from the excessive perfection of the USS Enterprise to the station that resembles our gritty reality rather than Roddenberry's perfect future.Rick Berman and Michael Piller did a great job creating this show and keeping it alive and healthy after Roddenberry's death, while giving a fitting end to The Next Generation.Paramount Pictures did a great job, creating both the pilot and the show. I give Emissary a 9 out of 10.",9
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Emissary (TV Episode 1993)",From Wolf 359 to The Denorios Belt,"This series begins with something we have never seen: A Space Battle: Between The Borg and The Federation at Wolf 359. We get to see the saucer section of Admiral Hanson's Excelsior Class cruiser being vaporized by Locutus of Borg. Benjamin Sisko is a Lieutenant Commander on The Saratoga taking orders from a Vulcan (J. G. Hertzler) and the Bridge has been patched together to become a battle bridge. The Saratoga is a Miranda-Class ship like The Reliant from Star Trek II; it gets disabled and then destroyed in short order. Sisko's wife Jennifer (Felicia M. Bell) is killed. A Bolian Ensign drags Sisko away from the body and as he watches from an escape pod, Sisko's whole world is destroyed.Three Years Later, Commander Sisko is assigned to the Bajoran Space Station. We get our first look at DS9 through the window of the ship Sisko and his son Jake (Cirroc Lofton) are traveling on: The Moment the Station is shown the music changes to incorporate strands from the theme of Deep Space Nine.This intro is the only connection to The Next Generation we get; there is nothing else familiar, even O'Brien who we knew from TNG is wearing a new kind of Uniform for the space station. As Sisko walks through the station it seems that the bloody Cardies have left few things intact: there is junk piled everywhere, most of the systems offline.Our first impression of Major Kira is to remind us of Ensign Ro (Michelle Forbes, who was offered the role but at the time did not want to commit to a seven year contract). And Nana Visitor does seem a lot like Ro, if something is bothering her she has no trouble telling us. Sisko makes the mistake of asking her, and he gets a bellyful before an alarm goes off in The Assayer's Office. A small Ferengi Child named ""Nog"" (Aaron Eisenberg) is robbing the place blind, with some Alien GangBanger. This is our introduction to ""Odo"" (Rene Aberjonois, of ""Benson"")-The thug tosses some nasty-looking spiked weapon at Odo's head which turns into Jelly and passes it right through! Most of the merchants on the Promenade area of the station are leaving, and Sisko needs to get them to stay somehow. He uses the incident with Nog to force the cooperation of Quark, Ferengi owner of the Gambling Joint, who was packing up. Nog's incarceration forces him to stay and be ""Community Leader!""-This is another thing not ever seen in any Trek before: A ""Hooman"", a Bajoran, an Unknown Alien Shapeshifter, and a Ferengi, all having a discussion: and from that moment it becomes the standard for seven years of Alien Crosstalk.Sisko finally responds to a summons by Captain Picard, and his dislike of Picard is evident: Picard was Locutus, who caused the death of his wife. Picard gives him his orders: make Bajor ready for Federation Membership. But Sisko tells Picard he is considering leaving Starfleet, ""In the Meantime"" (This is a common ST Phrase, used in ST: VI by the Federation President)-He will do the job he was commanded to do. We see the worry on Picard's face and that his hand was in the picking of Sisko for this job.We get to meet Kai Opaka, the spiritual leader of Bajor (Camille Savoilla), giving us an impression of ancient Spirituality. She is concerned for ""The Prophets"" and gives him the most sacred object of Bajor: The last remaining Orb (The Orb of Contemplation). She exposes him to it, and he is brought back to the day he met Jennifer on Gilgo Beach. It has come to me, that is was not a ""Vision"": Somehow he was actually brought there.The final two Starfleet officers arrive: Dir. Bashir (Sid El Fadil) and Dax (Terry Farrell)-This was Sid's first television show and that freshness, that air of inexperience works well. He puts a huge foot in mouth when he tells Kira about ""Frontier Medicine."" Sisko puts his ""Old Friend"" Dax to work (Jadzia is 28, but she has the memories of a 300 plus year old Trill Symbiote, plus those of Curzon Dax, Sisko's Mentor)-The Trill were given a ""Specieslift"" here, they were given Famke Jansen's Spots. Dax finds that the Orbs have come from The Denorios Belt: But they can't go looking because Gul Dukat, the former Cardassian overseer, is waiting for them to leave so they can follow. Kira creates a ruse to make the Cardassian's leave; Odo sneaks on to the Cardassian Ship and sabotages it. O'Brien has to KICK the Cardy Transporter to get Odo back.Sisko and Dax find The Wormhole, the only Stable Wormhole known to exist, instantly making Bajor a commodity. The Prophets stop the runabout because they want to have a Tete-a-Tete with ""The Sisko""More things start happening: Ducat follows them in to the Wormhole and gets into trouble, more Cardies arrive, and the Station is moved to the wormhole. Kira, O'Brien and Dax (returned to the Station in an Orb Device) figure out how to move the station, and bluff a Cardy Gul.Bajor gets The Wormhole and the Prophets agree to let them use it. Sisko tells Picard he changed his mind. Picard, knowing the officer he picked, never sent Sisko's request.Picard should have been more involved with this series, but he was not The Emissary, it was always The Sisko. ""Because it could be no one else"" as Sisko's real mother tells him in Season 7.In the whole seven year run, the story never swayed from what was laid down here. It was always Bajor and The Prophets, and the Emissary, Benjamin Sisko.",10
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Emissary (TV Episode 1993)",An Excellent Intro to Deep Space Nine,"From its opening moments, this entry in the Star Trek universe was compelling.  The characters are terrific and the setting is filled with possibilities.  There's a sort of ""Old West"" feel to Deep Space Nine. Sure, the Law (StarFleet) reigns supreme, but when you're on the frontier, things aren't always black and white.Over the length of the series, the characters realized such distinct personalities, preferences, hobbies and motivations.  Even meeting them for the first time in ""The Emissary"", it was obvious that these were people with unique pasts limitless futures.  The 3D characters in Deep Space Nine are far more interesting than their hollow counterparts in The Next Generation.If you like the original Star Trek, skip TNG and cozy on up to Deep Space Nine.  The spirit of Captain Kirk is alive and well in DS9 and ""The Emissary"" is a great way to meet the crew.Personal note:  I just love Marc Alaimo as Gul Dukat.  I've never seen him in anything else, but the episodes with Dukat are wonderful.",9

In the process the Saratoga is destroyed, along with his wife (however his son Jake does survive).Now, forward 3 years to the present - Sisko is offered the command of the remote station Deep Space Nine, which is situated on the edge of Federation space, a station that only until recently belonged to the Cardassians. The station also orbits planet Bajor, a planet that has just gained independence from the aforementioned Cardassians. The Bajorans, as a Federation protectorate, allows the Federation to control the station, though they have their officers there (including the hot-tempered Major Kira Nerys). Also along for the ride are Dr. Bashir, the shape-shifting Constable Odo, the sneaky Ferengi Quark (who owns a bar on the station), the Trill Jadzia Dax (who knows Sisko from a previous body the Trill inhabited), and the newly promoted Chief O'Brien (from the TNG Enterprise) and his family.While Sikso and crew must bring the station up to speck, they start investigating an anomaly - one that will have far repercussions for this sector of the galaxy. At the same time, Sisko must deal with his own nemesis, that of Picard (whom he associates with the death of his wife) who comes to the station. Sisko must also decide whether to stay as Commander of Deep Space Nine.A worthy introduction to a new (and darker) Star Trek world.",8
6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Emissary (TV Episode 1993)",Why?,"This is the best pilot for ST out there! Let's just say that this is just the pilot, and it seems a little time passed before the shot the second episode because it has a completely different feel that will become the norm for the rest of the series. Avery Brooks will tend to over-act but this becomes more balanced as the series progresses. Finally we get a child character you can like too, in Jake Sisko (way less annoying than Wesley IMO).I think this is the greatest Star Trek nay sci-fi series ever made, and when it ended, I was left with an overwhelming sense of loss. I felt like I had lost some really great friends and I would never see them again. So I ask why? Why did they end it and never look back? This series was rich with spin-offs, potential movies - a never-ending cash cow, and yet it ended abruptly after wasting an entire season devoping Ezri instead of tying up the loose ends. Why? Now that you know how I feel about the show, I will point out some major plot holes in this and all episodes of the series DS9.Chief O'Brien was a Lieutenant Transporter Chief on the Enterprise, a commissioned officer. On DS9 he suddenly becomes a non-commissioned officer Chief rank and loses the ability to give orders to anyone but the engineers- and later submits to Ensign Nog who was but a child a year before to him. As I understand the only way to rid yourself of a commission is to lose it via insubordination or to resign it. Neither of these were likely to occur when they were sending him to the MOST important place in the quadrant at that time - DS9. So I ask again. Why? Second of all, I don't know if there are branches of service in ST since they never mention it as far as I know, but a star base is basically territory. And territory is held by an Army, so why send a commander in the Starfleet Navy to do that job? Isn't that the job of a StarArmy or perhaps an elected official?If people of the future don't need money, yet ferengi still value the non-replicatable gold-encased liquid latinum(the gold is a worthless container for up to a few drops of latinum) for it's rarity, then how does the cast ever afford to go to Quark's, or the holo-suites, or anywhere on the promenade, including tailoring by Garak? If Starfleet gave them some sort of pay, the rest of Starfleet would want pay too and that would unsettle the entire concept of the entire ST universe. They kind of address this a tiny bit later on by Sisko threatening Quark to do his bidding because they let him operate for free, but he never says ""free services for the crew"" and there are times when they make payments on quark's thumbpad so money is being exchanged. Oh by the way, in the first season of TNG they mention gold as being valuable still - so that's weird. Plus, no one complained about replicated food on the Enterprise they thought it was great, so why now on DS9? Why pay for food when you can get it for free in your room?Lastly, why dock on the station at all? They have transporters that can beam them anywhere aboard the station (they could only beam you to a few set locations on the enterprise mind you) and their cargo. So why not park outside at full stop in a ""parking lot"", unattached, and transport in? You would think quarantining thru bioscrubbers in the transporter to maintain station welfare would be a major concern. They never address this issue, people just hop right on the station and exchange hugs and handshakes and air as it decompresses onto the station.And now I will answer a Why for you. The reason why you rarely see Bajoran ships (Season 7 Episode 2 ""Shadows and Symbols"") is because they basically have none of their own. The ones they do have are decades old and from ""The Occupation"" or before. They are sub-warp, and have vastly inferior weaponry and shields. Because they are in the process of joining the Federation they are under Federation protection and (we assume) will soon acquire new non-Bajoran Federation ships as part of that induction.",9
7,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Emissary (TV Episode 1993)",Brave New Start,"Was still coming down off the high of the series finale of TNG as it was extraordinary. This show was a brand new concept. I was a little unnerved by it's premise, 'To Boldly Stay Where No One Has Stayed Before'. O boy was I wrong! Commander Ben Sisko was played with depth, emotion and so much integrity by Avery Brooks from minute one. The opener of this series was superb. Revisiting the battle of Wolf 359 was genius. The tension between Sisko and Picard was so well done. Patrick Stewart there to show all how to do it I'm sure! The Station is in the Bajoran System. The episode rolled on and the Wormhole is discovered. It is stable, a first for the Federation The Cardassians and Bajor were both relatively young races for Star Trek, but both were interesting and had so much room for development. The crew, Dax, a Trill with lots of oomph and wonderful character. Doctor Julian Bashir, an annoying at first character but who blossomed into one of the show's best. Major Kira Nerys, the Bajoran Liason and First Officer of the Station. Odo, Chief of Security and affectionately named 'Constable', a Shape shifter with an unexplored background. Miles Edward O'Brien, Chief Of Operations who has transferred over from the USS Enterprise and finally Jake Sisko, the latter Sisko's son.

From the start the show is riveting; the opening scene of the destruction of the Federation ship, the Wolf was amazing as was the Dax's and Sisko's journey through the wormhole and Sisko's encounter with the aliens. Strong plot with a strong ensemble cast. The only weak link in the cast (the character, not the actor) is Dr. Bashir.

While I enjoyed most of the movies and am a huge fan of TNG, the rest is more or less up for grabs. I have only seen two season's worth of the most recent incarnation, Enterprise, and I find it a very underrated series, thanks in particular to the knockout season 3 Xindi story arc. Voyager did little for me, with its subpar cast and bland storytelling hindering its otherwise enticing premise. But it's Deep Space Nine that baffles me the most.For the past several weeks, I've been trying to catch up on DS9 so that I could follow the Dominion War arc, and I started from season 3's The Die is Cast, which proved to be a pretty exciting episode so I decided to give the series a shot. And from there on out, it's been up and down for me. I wasn't able to catch all the episodes, but I tried my best to see those that pushed the Dominion story forward. The end result was an often frustrating mix of engrossing episodes (The Way of the Warrior, Broken Link, Apocalypse Rising, Tears of the Prophets, The Siege of AR-558) mixed with plenty that I found rather overrated (In the Pale Moonlight, season 6's Dominion-occupied DS9 arc).But I'm pretty glad to see that the series on ended on a high note thanks to the Final Chapter arc, which concluded with the terrific two-hour What You Leave Behind, which proved to be one of the Star Trek franchise's most exciting and moving episodes (other solid episodes in this arc include The Changing Face of Evil, When it Rains, Tackling the Wind, and The Dogs of War). Consequently, I was pretty curious to revisit the first episode and see how it all began, and while watching Emissary worked as a curiosity for a while, it wasn't long before boredom set in.Not that Emissary doesn't get off to a decent start. The opening sequence depicting the Battle of Wolf 359 is a fast-paced way to get the series going, even if the battle itself appears way too small in scale. The actual introduction of the station and its crew is handled fairly well, and it was nice to compare and see how the characters progressed over the years, the most obvious instances being Major Kira (Nana Visitor) and the Ferengi Nog. Kira is actually one of my favorite characters on the show, so it's particularly interesting to see the hostility she displays towards the Federation in this episode, especially compared to how she handles being in charge of the station by the final episode.Most of this premiere suffers because it has to establish a none-too-exciting set-up. In this case, it's watching Sisko deal with the prophets while coming to terms with his own emotional pain. Undoubtedly, it's the emissary/prophets storyline that I like least about DS9 (well, maybe it's a bit better than those annoying Ferengi episodes), as I don't think the series ever did a particularly good job of making the prophets or their motives intriguing. Their presence has also been ripe for some deus ex machina moments (Sacrifice of Angels comes to mind).It doesn't help that some the acting comes across rather amateurish, particularly Terry Farrell as Jadzia Dax and the actress that plays Sisko's wife. Even the typically solid Avery Brooks slips in quality on occasion here. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the best performance is delivered by Patrick Stewart, who makes an enjoyable cameo appearance as everyone's favorite French British starship captain. So maybe this wasn't such a good start, but it's nice to know the series would improve and I am looking forward to seeing how the Dominion are introduced.",
12,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Emissary (TV Episode 1993)",Maybe Too Much but Still,"I'll start by saying it is a nice change from the constant problems of starships. To make the setting a ramshackle space station that has been decimated by its previous tenants, makes for a new dynamic. We are also informed of a race of people, the Bejorans, whose population is living in poverty and despair, waiting for their religious leader to gain some sort of stability and avoid a civil war. The space station has a Bejoran woman running the show and a shape shifter, Odo, who is a constable. There are so many others and so many plot lines set up that it would be silly to try to mention them all. Mostly, the hero is a man who is putting his life together after losing his wife to a Borg attack. He starts out with a huge weight, unhappy at the assignment to get DS9 back in line. I appears to be quite promising. I saw a few episodes when it came out, but missed any continuity.",10
13,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Emissary (TV Episode 1993)",Best pilot for a Trek series,"1.01 ""Emissary""Newly reassigned Commander Benjamin Sisko and his hodgepodge crew attempt to restore a former Cardassian space station into something resembling a Federation outpost, far on the outskirts of Federation space and crewed by a combination of Starfleet and Bajoran personnel. They get way more than they bargained for when a the first stable wormhole in the galaxy is discovered in their backyard, and a showdown ensues with the Cardassians, who are bitter about having to abandon Bajor and eager to claim the new discovery for themselves. But the inhabitants and creators of the wormhole are far more than they seem, and their role in the Bajor-Cardassia conflict will have consequences that stretch for years in the future and indeed beyond the bounds of time itself.Star Trek: The Next Generation had so much success that Paramount decided not to even wait until it was off the air to begin a spinoff, with season 1 of DS9 more or less coinciding with TNG season 6. Gene Roddenberry having recently passed on, the new series would not be guided by his unrealistically optimistic vision of the future, but rather be a far more human and gritty view of the future. Deep Space Nine is really the most relatable and emotion-infused of the Star Trek shows by far. Building off of what was established in TOS and TNG, DS9 was able to create the deepest and most complex of all the many ST series without being bound by Roddenberry's overly-restrictive mandates that everyone always get along and Federation society being portrayed as perfectly utopian. What we get instead is a refreshingly honest and wholly human (ironic considering the most human characters are often aliens) depiction of life in the 24th century.As for the episode's story, it was brilliantly set up by TNG in episodes like ""The Wounded"" and ""Ensign Ro."" Long before ""Emissary"" ever saw the airwaves, we were already quite familiar with the worlds of Bajor, Cardassia, and the conflict that has raged between them for generations. This is very fortunate, because the plot of ""Emissary"" is quite complex, and not having to engage in an excessive amount of world-building allowed the writers to spend more time setting up the characters and their specific conflicts, which are equally as complex as the plot (even more so, actually). Due to this prior exposition, ""Emissary"" is able to concentrate so purely on its plot and characters that it ends up being the best ST pilot to date (granted, the bar was not high). The story is not only engaging, but it sets up a conflict that will persist without tiring for seven seasons (and beyond), while also introducing some of the deepest and most layered characters to ever exist in the ST universe. Although its highest points never match those of TNG and TOS, its consistency across seven season makes DS9 equal to those shows in terms of overall quality and it all starts with a pilot that far surpasses ""Farpoint"" or the various TOS pilots.THE GOOD-Using Picard to launch the show was brilliant. The scenes he is in a great, but DS9 takes things to the next level by having Picard be in many ways the bad guy. This is a man we have spent five seasons growing in admiration for, and suddenly our new protagonist despises him to the core. What genius way to distance these shows from each other. The undisguised contempt Sisko shows for Picard, combined with the deep pain seen in Picard's eyes at the mention of Wolf 359 is just an incredible interaction between two great characters. A million points to the writers (and Patrick Stewart) for these scenes.-It's honestly amazing to me how the story threads that are started in this episode are carried through so seamlessly for seven seasons. You'd think that the Cardassian-Bajoran conflict would run its course within a few seasons, but the incredibly complex dynamics of the wormhole, the Prophets, and especially the Dominion allow that conflict to persist for the entire series run without ever drying up narratively. This episode becomes truly brilliant when viewed through the lens of all seven seasons.-Colm Meaney. He was crimally underutilized on TNG and moving him to DS9 was a great decision to let an all time great actor have a starring role that was long overdue.THE BAD-Odo's makeup isn't great in this ep. He looks skeletal.-Nana Visitor is a bad actress and her character mostly annoys me. She's not as bad as, say, Troi or Neelix, but she definitely is a weak spot in an otherwise pretty good cast.-I've never been a fan of the DS9 uniforms. I think the TNG ones look much better and I wish they had just used those.-The sequence with Sisko talking to the Prophets in the wormhole drags on for way too long. The episode is great until this point and then it really bogs down with frustrating dialogue and no plot movement. If this sequence had been edited down we might be looking at a 10/10 episode.-I'll get into it more as I review more eps, but Avery Brooks is such an awkward actor. He overacts and his delivery of lines is often sharply at odds with the emotion he is supposed to be conveying (like when he seems to be smiling while chewing out a subordinate). From watching interviews and other extra content of him, it's clear to me that he is simply a weird dude, and that has made it slightly easier for me to swallow his unusual acting style...but only slightly. I think that Sisko is the most well-written of the ST captains by far, but Brooks' weirdness as a person and an actor makes me rank him slightly below Picard and probably equal to Kirk on the all-time captain rankings. THE UGLY-""Never trust an ale from a god-fearing people."" Quark needs to try a Belgian abbey ale!-Why are the Bajorans allowing Cardassian warships back into their space? I get that Bajor can't really do much about it, but it seems like a glossed-over point that should have been a major diplomatic issue. There's no way that, after almost a century of planety occupation and rape, the Bajorans would be cool with Cardassian soldiers taking shore leave on one of their stations.-There is a lot of effects shots of Odo shapeshifting in this ep. I guess the effects budget must have been slashed for future eps because Odo's shifting is seen very rarely for the next few seasons.-Interestingly, in the Wolf 359 scenes, Sisko's Vulcan captain is played by J.G. Hetzler, who would go on to play a starring role much later in the show as General Martok.",8

The station also orbits planet Bajor, a planet that has just gained independence from the aforementioned Cardassians. The Bajorans, as a Federation protectorate, allows the Federation to control the station, though they have their officers there (including the hot-tempered Major Kira Nerys). Also along for the ride are Dr. Bashir, the shape-shifting Constable Odo, the sneaky Ferengi Quark (who owns a bar on the station), the Trill Jadzia Dax (who knows Sisko from a previous body the Trill inhabited), and the newly promoted Chief O'Brien (from the TNG Enterprise) and his family.While Sikso and crew must bring the station up to speck, they start investigating an anomaly - one that will have far repercussions for this sector of the galaxy (including with the Cardassians - in the form of Gul Dukat). At the same time, Sisko must deal with his own nemesis, that of Picard (whom he associates with the death of his wife in the battle with the Borg 3 years before) who comes to the station. Sisko must also decide whether to stay as Commander of Deep Space Nine.A worthy introduction to a new (and darker) Star Trek world.",8

However, when Sisko meets up with aliens living within this passageway, things get pretty dumb.When the show begins, you see the battle between the Borg (commanded by Locutus) and the Federation. In the battle, Sisko is nearly killed and his wife is killed by these intergalactic jerks. As a result, Sisko is really ticked...and it doesn't help that Captain Picard is the one who assigns Sisko to command the space station since Picard WAS Locutus when he was absorbed into the Borg two seasons earlier. Oops. In addition, Sisko runs about the space station and the planet Bajor meeting folks and pretty much introducing them to the audience. When a stable wormhole opens up near Bajor, however, the show changes moods very quickly. Now he meets aliens who instead of sitting down and talking with him, they occupy the essence of people Sisko has known and they interact VERY quickly--with one fast intercut scene after another after another. It's very artsy and cerebral...and incredibly boring and dumb. It also is chocked full of too much information being thrown at the audience through the aliens. It came very unnaturally and should have been handled more deliberately. As a result, 2/3 of the way into the show, I felt like turning it off! My family begged me to do so but I was able to persevere until the very end. A rather awful introduction as a result of all this silliness.",4
0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Past Prologue (TV Episode 1993)",Classic DS9 - Introducing Elim Garak,"Brilliantly, the franchise decided to jump from the very heavy, convoluted and intense Emissary which revolved around Ben Sisko and the precarious situation which would center on him for the next seven years directly into a no-less-serious but very different drama. More importantly, this is the episode which first unleashed the great Andy Robinson into his very beautifully developed recurring character Elim Garak - the most popular Cardassian in Star Trek history and perhaps the most sympathetic alien (besides Spock) in the canon. Garak is, of course, introduced by way of his relationship with Dr. Bashir (Alex Siddig, then credited as Siddig El Faddil) and throughout the series Siddig's best episodes will most often be those featuring Garak.Garak is either a left-behind Cardassian tailor or a Cardassian spy or both, and he is particularly concerned about the arrival of a Bejoran ""Terrorist"" (or freedom fighter, depending on your perspective) who has been running from Cardassian authorities and is seeking asylum. Kira,of course, knows Tahna Los, the suspected terrorist, and pleads with Sisko to allow him to stay.As the story develops, the powerful ethnic conflict between Bejorans and Cardassians becomes a central focus. This will be well-exploited throughout all seven of DS9's seasons. And Garak's contribution to the depth and range of what it is to be a Cardassian ensured that the Cardies could never become just another franchise stereotype disguised by a forehead prosthetic. Finally, Past Prologue allows some breathing room for Avery Brooks to settle into his role as Ben Sisko, and includes some important developments in his relationships to Kira, Odo, and the Cardassian military.Acting highlights - Robinson, Visitor, Siddig, Brooks and Auberjonois are all terrific in Past Prologue.As usual, the episode is economically directly and scripted, well-shot and thoroughly entertaining from start to finish.",10
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Past Prologue (TV Episode 1993)",Great introduction for Garak,"Having introduced the primary characters in the opening episode it is time to introduce one of the main secondary characters; the enigmatic Garak. The station gossip suggests that he is there to spy for the Cardassians he however claims that he is just a simple tailor. When he approaches Doctor Bashir as he eats dinner the young doctor is convinced he has been approached for information although it isn't clear whether this is the case or whether Garak rather likes people thinking he is more than just a tailor.This episode's main story involves Tahna Los, a Bajoran, who arrives at the station being pursued by the Cardassians, they demand that Sisko hand him over because he is a terrorist who is part of a group that has continued to attack Cardassians after the ceasefire was agreed. He however claims to be a freedom fighter who has now given up violence and just wants to return home. Major Kira does not want a Bajoran to be handed over to the Cardassians but is unsure whether Tahna Los is quite as retired as he claims. He certainly starts looking more suspicious when two renegade Klingons turn up and meet him. When it becomes clear that he is planning something the crew of DS9 must discover what he is planning and prevent him from doing so.The main story isn't one of the best in the series but the way it introduces Garak, fantastically played by Andrew Robinson, was great, we see that he knows how to deal with people but we still don't know his motives; did he help the Federation learn what Tahna Los was up to because he wanted to help then, because it also served Cardassian needs or did he have personal reasons? we just don't know.",8
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Past Prologue (TV Episode 1993)",Round one to Sisko,"Good episode not only because it introduces Garak, the only remaining Cardassian on DS9 but because it establishes the Kira/Sisko relationship. Garak introduces himself to Dr. Bashir in a seemingly friendly manner. The gee whiz adolescent Bashir is all atwitter when he tells his colleagues about the meeting and is sure that Garak wants to wheedle medical secrets out of him. His colleagues receive this ""news"" with humorous exasperation. Concurrently, fleeing from the Cardassians, a Bajoran resistance fighter, Tahna Los,seeks asylum on DS9. The Cardassians insist that Sisko turn Tahna Los over to them as he has continued to attack and kill Cardassians even after the cease fire. Concerned that Sisko may indeed return Los to the Cardassians, Kira goes over Sisko's head and complains. There are two questions in this episode, is Tahna Los actually retired from what is now considered a terrorist group and what are Garak's motives in helping the Federation - is he the simple tailor he pretends to be or is he a spy? One of these questions is resolved, one is not. But what is resolved is that Kira better understands Sisko and is coming to respect his strength. Also interesting to see is the budding friendship between Kira and Odo. As she tells Odo - things were easier when she knew who the enemy was. Garak's role is a welcome addition to the DS9 story.",8
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Past Prologue (TV Episode 1993)",Is this episode 2 or 3? I dunno...,"This episode is listed as episode 2 on IMDb. However, when shown on Netflix, it's listed as episode 3. I really am not sure which is which--perhaps you know for sure.When the episode begins, the tailor, Garak, is introduced as he works hard to build a relationship with Dr. Bashir. He's obviously a Cardassian spy--but why would he foster this relationship with the Doctor? At the same time, an old associate of Major Kiera in the Bajoran underground is headed towards Deep Space 9--with the Cardassians in hot pursuit. When he asks for asylum on base, what is Sisko to do? And, why did he arrive here? Well, it gets even more interesting when two Klingons arrive. How will these three players' stories intersect? See the show.The main reasons for this episode are to further explore Major Kiera's dilemma of divided loyalties as well as to introduce a semi-regular character, Garak. All in all, rather exciting and worth seeing--and a lot better than the dull and artsy premier episode.",8
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Past Prologue (TV Episode 1993)",What do we do with a Bajoran exile?,"The new relationship and command structure of DS9 gets a test here as Nana Visitor and Avery Brooks are at odds over how to handle the arrival of former
Bajoran freedom fighter Jeffrey Nordling coming to DS9 with some Cardassians
in hot pursuit. They want him for terrorist acts, Nordling wants asylum.There's more to it than that. The infamous Klingon Douras sisters also arrive at
DS9. And Andrew Robinson shows how his rather intriguing character Garak the
Cardassian tailor has his fingers in many pies.Confrontation scenes between Sisko and Kira are key here and well done.",7
5,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Past Prologue (TV Episode 1993)",Tightly executed story with great characters,"1.02 ""Past Prologue""A Bajoran terrorist named Tahna Los barely escapes pursuing Cardassians and requests asylum aboard DS9. He turns out to have a history with Major Kira, who advocates for him. He insists that his days of violence are over, but with the help of Plain Simple Garak, who uses the naive Bashir as his unwitting accomplice, the crew of DS9 discover that Tahna may not be sincere about his intentions on the station, and the tense confrontation that results will influence the future of Bajor.The is the first ""normal"" episode of the show and it continues the high quality storytelling and character development from the pilot. The plot here is pretty complicated, but the writing is sharp and the directing and editing is tight, which gives the whole episode a polish that is rare for a show so early in its run, particularly by ST standards. TNG is great, but there is no doubt that is stumbled a LOT in its first two seasons. While season 1 is probably my least favorite from DS9, that is mainly just because the show continually got better as it went, and not due to any real flaws with the season, aside from perhaps some claustrophobia setting-wise.In general, Bajoran episodes are among my least favorite ones on DS9 (probably mainly because they always feature Kira, who is my least favorite character on the show), but the excellent use of suspense and tension and some really solid pacing (not to mention a lot of great moments with Garak and/or the Duras sisters) makes this episode highly enjoyable in spite of poorly-acted Kira tantrums and those awful drab Bajoran uniforms.THE GOOD-Garak!! I think arguably the best part about DS9 is the deep roster of great recurring characters like Garak, Dukat, Weyoun, Damar, Martok, etc. The overall acting talent of the main cast is pretty average at best, but the recurring characters are almost always a highlight of any episode they appear in. And of all the best recurring characters, Garak is my favorite (well, him and Damar are tied as my favs). I think Andrew Robinson's acting is incredible and he absolutely oozes a serpentine quality that is perfect for the enigmatic Cardassian tailor. Watching him toy with Bashir in this episode is like seeing an apex predator play with its food. You really never know what Garak is going to do next, and every scene with him is just a joy to watch.-I love seeing the Duras sisters here. They are cartoonishly evil but immensely amusing. For better or worse, they capture your full attention every time they are on screen. And having another TNG cameo effectively reinforces what Picard's presence in the pilot was showing--that these two series are taking place at the same time in the same basic setting.-""Go over my head again, and I'll have yours...on a platter."" One thing I love about Sisko is his 'no BS' attitude. Even the ever-petulant Kira was cowed by that dressing-down.-The Odo and Kira scene in the security office is good. Even though I don't care for Kira very much, their friendship is nice and Rene Auberjonois is a really great actor who gets to shine here.THE BAD-The Bajoran clothes and uniforms are so ugly and I hate them. Every Bajoran-centric episode is 10% less enjoyable due to that alone.-Some mediocre acting from the guy who plays Tahna, as well as by Nana Visitor, drags the scenes down a bit where it's just the two of them.THE UGLY-Runabout roster: Ganges, Yangtzee Kiang, Rio Grande-Odo shapeshift count: 1 (rat), 3 total for series-If Gul Danar looks familiar, that's because he is played by Vaughn Armstrong, who has played a total of eleven different ST characters to date. This is his second appearance, with his role as a renegade Klingon in the TNG season 1 episode ""Heart of Glory"" being his first, and Admiral Maxwell Forest on ENT being his most numerous and recognizable.-I was curious why the Ganges has a extra module on its dorsal side that the Yangtzee Kiang doesn't have. Turns out that is an advanced sensor module, which explains why the Ganges can monitor the Yangtzee around the moon but not vice-versa.-It's unclear why Tahna said he needed a warp-capable ship for his mission. Everything seems to take place within the Bajoran system, so a sublight ship would work just fine. However, the top speed of a Danube-class runabout is Warp 5, which about 200 times the speed of light. Since it takes them about 2.5 minutes to get to DS9, that implies that DS9 is 9 billion kilometers away, or about 60 AU. For reference, Neptune is about 30 AU from the sun, which means that DS9 and the wormhole are probably very far out on edge the Bajoran solar system and would make a sublight journey possibly take a very long time, increasing the chances his plan would be detected and stopped. -The Cardassian ship takes about 4 minutes to reach DS9 from the Cardassian border. The top speed of a Galor-class cruiser is around warp 8 (about 1000 times the speed of light), which means the Cardassian border is only .008 light years away, or about 493 AU. This implies that a large part of the Bajoran system's Oort cloud (if it has one) isn't even in Bajoran space, as the Oort cloud is believed to be able to extend more than a lightyear from its parent star. -Dax and someone else should have been piloting the Ganges, not Sisko and O'Brien. It makes no sense for the CO and chief engineer to be doing that job. It also would have been nice for Dax to actually have something to do in the episode.",8

Not long afterwards Ibudan is killed in one of the Holosuites and evidence suggests that nobody else entered or left... through the door, it would have been possible for a shape-shifter to get in though leading to Odo being the chief suspect.

The identity of the murderer also came as quite a surprise.",8

A merciless Bajoran smuggler who Odo tries to kick off the station turns up murdered in a room which has been locked from the inside and, understandably, Odo is the prime suspect. The episode is crucial to understanding Odo's relationships with Kira, Sisko, and Quark and introduces the show's standard approach to story arc multitasking which will be greatly elaborated in the later seasons. Odo - who really is a man alone - must learn to trust others to help him figure this one out and clear him of suspicion.The two-story approach was not very well perfected in this episode, and some of the important developmental aspects of this episode (Keiko, Jake and Nog's parts) come across as a slightly annoying distraction from the more intense and interesting mystery story.As usual, the cinematography and writing are all good.",6
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" A Man Alone (TV Episode 1993)",And no apology was forthcoming,"A bit of a letdown after just watching the pilot episode but still a good watch. Odo recognizes a nasty Bajoran smuggler and wants him thrown off DS9. Sisko won't do it since the Bajoran has not committed any crimes since being released from jail. When the Bajoran is murdered it appears that only a shape shifter could have gotten into the holo-suite and killed the Bajoran. This is a great spin on the classic ""locked room"" mystery story and the solution is certainly unique. But the best part of the show was the depiction of the development of a mob. The mob is after Odo and smash the windows to his room and start a near riot. Showing some force, Sisko gets them to disperse. The side story has Keiko opening a school for the children living on DS9 and hoping that she'll get more than just Sisko's son for a student. This is a nice snippet on the daily life on the DS9. Sisko has a summary narration at the end where he says, among other things ""And no apology to Odo was forthcoming."" Mob members certainly are courageous.",7
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" A Man Alone (TV Episode 1993)",I thought this was a big improvement over the premier.,"I have no idea if this is the second or third episode of ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"". Netflix lists this as the second and IMDb says it's the third. Regardless, it's a big improvement over the premier episode.I love Star Trek shows, but I also am critical of the program when it deserves it. In other words, while I like it I also realize that some of the shows were exceptional and some of them sucked...and the premier of ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" really sucked. While the premier SHOULD have built excitement for the series, it was full of artsy crap in the last 1/3 and had way too much clumsy exposition. Because of this, ""Past Prologue"" was a very welcome relief. It was not jam-packed with folks describing their backstory in a very clumsy and unnatural way nor was it filled with the artsy stuff--it was just very good.When the show begins, Keiko is depressed. While her husband, Miles, is at home on the new station, she has nothing to do and is worried about her future on the station. Then, she comes up with the idea of starting a school on the station.The major plot involves a scum-bag, Ibudan. This Bajoran is a very unsavory character and convicted murderer--so why is he now on the station? Odo is clearly angry to see this man--especially since he was the one who caught him years ago for the murder. But, with the man being paroled by the new Bajoran government, Odo can do little but bluster and threaten Ibudan. However, when Ibudan is murdered, many folks on the station assume that Odo took the law into his own hands. What happened and what is REALLY going on here?This is a very solid and enjoyable episode. While it's not one you'd remember years later (I know I didn't), it is a conventionally entertaining and worthy show with a nice twist at the end. Well done.",8

6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" A Man Alone (TV Episode 1993)",Cop procedural in space,"1.03 ""A Man Alone""A Bajoran that Odo put away for murder years earlier appears on the station and has a confrontation with the constable. Shortly after that he is found dead, and all the evidence points to Odo having done it. A search for truth ensues.This is episode is very much whatever the station equivalent of a ship-in-a-bottle episode would be (Stationary terrarium? I got nothing). The entire episode takes place on DS9, and as a result it feels rather low stakes and unexciting. That is unfortunately a trend of the early seasons. The wormhole is a gold mine for fascinating and creative storytelling, but for whatever reason (probably budgetary), much of the first few seasons are spent solely in the Bajoran system and the setting gets extremely claustrophobic as a result.That said, this isn't a bad episode, just an inconsequential one. The mystery and its resolution are cleverly done, and the plot threads all weave together in a very tidy way that I appreciate as a writer. But the conflict between Odo's sense of justice and Starfleet rules will be done much better in later episodes, and the suspense is very minimal because nobody will really believe that Odo is the murderer. Overall, a mediocre episode by DS9 and ST standards.THE GOOD-Cleverly-written mystery with a neat resolution-Some interesting glimpses of Odo's philosophy and into Dax's history and her Trill nature.-All of the main characters get involved and play an active role in the story (well, O'Brien is active in the B plot). When you only have 42 minutes to work with, it's impressive that they are able to do that.-Jadzia is really the highlight of this ep. Terry Farrell has said in interviews that she felt lost and overwhelmed as a 28 year old woman trying to portray a 300 year old being who has lived eight lives, and some of her unease does show through a bit, but overall I think she does a wonderful job. It helps that she is built like a legit Amazonian, because her attempts to project nobility are enhanced by the fact that she towers over many of the other actors.THE BAD-Nothing is overly bad, but the episode lacks suspense and doesn't explore much in the way of interesting sci-fi, and the story in inconsequential. It is essentially a cop procedural set on a space station, and that is of little interest to me.THE UGLY-Bashir retcon watch (WARNING: this section contains major spoilers for a future story arc) -- Does he allow the bubble in the holosuite to burst on purpose? I think that with the way his mental abilities are portrayed post-genetic-engineering reveal, he definitely could have controlled it better than that if he wanted.-Rom is totally different from future eps. He talks different, is way too confident, and doesn't have that awkward bent-over shuffling walk. -Hulk Kira count: 1 -- This is the first of many times we see Kira beat up a much larger dude (during the riot scene). It looks utterly ridiculous for a tiny woman like Nana Visitor to be literally tossing around dudes twice her size and yet we are forcefed it throughout the entire series. When Jadzia beats people up it's believable because she is built like a warrior, but Visitor is so petite that it's impossible to buy when she does it.",6

Shortly after, however, the story takes a very sinister turn as O Brien becomes heavily aphasic and is followed very quickly by many others on the station. Eventually, Sisko quarantines the station, and Kira is sent on a mission of mercy to try to locate the one person who may be able to save the crew.Brooks and Visitor turn in excellent performances in this episode, and the episode is important in the development of O'brien, Jake and Ben and Kira's characters.

A repair to the replicators seems a fairly minor thing but when he fixes the system he activates a device which create a virus that contaminates all the food and drink created. This has the effect of making the suffer be unable talk normally; whenever they speak they just come out with a stream of random words, the same thing happens if they try to write anything. As it becomes clear what is happening the crew must race to find a cure and the cause before the whole station is effected. When they find the cause they are shocked to see the booby trap has been their since the station was built but never activated as its Bajoran creator was caught by the Cardassians before he could activate it. He is now dead but his former assistant is still alive so Kira must secure his help whether he want to help or not.This was a good stand alone episode where most of the main characters featured, it was fun to see Quark taking a role in a position of responsibility when the command officers had all been effected by the virus. Just in case saving everybody from the virus wasn't exciting enough they have a problem when a ship tries to break quarantine which threatens to cause an explosion as it is still clamped to the station when it powers up its engines.",8

It is then a race to find one of the scientists who planted the device and to prevent one of the merchants from taking his ship away from the station.

Aside from some very minor character development for Quark and some great early scenes with O'Brien, this is a very forgettable episode.THE GOOD-The O'Brien scenes at the start are great. I love his sarcastic comments, and Colm Meaney is such a great actor (with an awesome accent) that I would be entertained watching him read lines from a quarterly earnings report.-The shot where it pans through the inner workings of the replicator and then focuses on the sabotage device right as it turns on is a cool one.-Some good Quark scenes. It's interesting how he fluctuates between bravado and cowardice seemingly at random, a trend that holds throughout the show's run.-Nice continuity mentioning Keiko's school established in the previous ep. It's easy to take for granted since all shows do it nowadays, but at the time DS9's serial storytelling was brand new for ST (and relatively uncommon on TV in general), and the fact that I don't even notice it most of the time is probably a testament to how well it is done.THE BAD-Another claustrophobic episode that takes place essentially all on DS9 (aside from one scene on a runabout).-*Sisko takes sip of coffee* ""O'Brien!"" I cringed. They may as well have used a laugh track and a *womp womp* trombone to go along with that dumb gag.-A lot of really bad acting from Avery Brooks.-Jadzia gets nothing to do for the second time in three eps.THE UGLY -Odo shapeshift count: 1 (a metal cart...and also the handheld device on top of the cart, oddly enough), 4 total for the series-Not sure which runabout Kira takes.

However, everyone's frustration soon is stretched to the limits when a weird virus breaks out on Deep Space 9. Suddenly, and without warning, people begin speaking gibberish-- long strings of random words with no meaning. And, oddly, they write the same way and no one can understand anyone who comes down with the virus. Not surprisingly this virus is NOT naturally occurring but was created by someone--but who and why and how to stop it is a HUGE concern.This is a silly episode that is quite original but also pretty dumb at the same time.

6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Babel (TV Episode 1993)",Ok despite some misssed opportunities,This episode seems like it could have been better with an extra few minutes to tell it's story. Which is interesting. More often it feels the episodes could lose about 10 minutes.What I wish the episode included was a scene showing the Bajoran doctor discover the cure from Bashir's initial work. This is kind of the climatic moment the story was leading up to. And they just kind of skip it and just tell us via Sisko's log that it happens. I call that a downer.The other scene I would have liked to see would have been a scene addressing whether the Major's action of capturing and infecting the bajoran doctor against his will was or wasn't acceptable or ethical.But overall the contagious babeling storyline was good.

MacDonald plays opposite Colm Meaney's Miles O'Brien as Tosk - a new species of alien which has just emerged from the Gamma Quadrant through the wormhole in a battle-damaged ship. Tosk is an intelligent creature, but so radically different from his human benefactors that he seems incomprehensible. O'brien is convinced that he means no harm, but is taken aback by Tosk's attempt to steal weapons from a secured weapon's locker. When Tosk's pursuers arrive, everybody is in for a surprise.As one of DS9's most unilinear and self-contained stories, Captive Pursuit is nearly unique among the post-TNG franchise episodes. It intelligently explores cultural difference without relying too heavily on the tired old Prime Directive.Colm Meaney gives one of the best performances Miles O'Brien experienced during Captive Pursuit. Despite Tosk's reptilian appearance and mannerisms, Meaney and MacDonald give their characters a certain odd and subtle chemistry which helps to carry the intelligently plotted story and well-written script. Avery Brooks also makes a very nice impression with his sparing but crucial portrayal of Sisko in this episode. Corey Allen's directing is economical and clean.Highly recommended for Trekkies and non-Trekkies alike",9
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Captive Pursuit (TV Episode 1993)",A good chance for Colm Meany to show he can act.,"Throughout his time on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", Colm Meany's character, Chief O'Brien, was a recurring character who received more and more screen time as the show progressed. However, he really never was a major character and only after he was transferred from the Enterprise to Deep Space 9 did he become a major character. Here in ""Captive Pursuit"" he's got his largest and most interesting role yet. It begins with a strange alien from the Delta Quadrant coming through the wormhole. His ship needs service and O'Brien tries hard to befriend the strange lizard-like being, Tosk. However, soon it becomes apparent that Tosk is some sort of prey in a hunt by some very powerful beings--and the station is expected to just hand Tosk over to them. I liked the episode for two main reasons. I loved how O'Brien was very tricky and behaved most unlike a Federation officer. The same, to a lesser extent, can be said for Sisko. I also liked it because the show was wholly original and engaging. Well worth seeing...and the best episode of the series so far.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Captive Pursuit (TV Episode 1993)",Tosk!,"Love anything with Colm Meaney. But this episode highlighted one of the things I hate the most. Hunting animals and killing them for pleasure. Even worse when it's a sentient, intelligent life form. O'Brien's stance with the alien, Tosk, who comes aboard is great viewing. When the aliens hunting him come aboard and demand his release, O'Brien does the proper thing and frees him. The whole situation moves at high speed and, after Tosk escapes, we see O'Brien in front of Commander Sisko who gives him a dressing down. But, just after O'Brien leaves, Sisko breaks into a wide grin, putting a cap on a superb episode. Scott McDonald was brilliant as Tosk also! This episode set the pace for a really good Star Trek series to come with some of Trek's most interesting characters and stories.",10

Once docked the chief goes to the ship but there is no sign of the pilot at first, as the chief examines the ship the alien appears behind him, clearly he has some sort of personal cloaking device. As the chief gets to know him we learn that he is called Tosk although it is uncertain whether that is his name or his species. Gradually Tosk and O'Brien become friends but this friendship is tested when Tosk is caught trying to access weapons. He is put in the brig but refuses to explain his actions. Soon another ship comes through the wormhole and it becomes clear that they are hunting Tosk; not for any crime he has committed but for sport. Sisko is horrified that a sentient being is being hunted, it is suggested to Tosk that he should seek asylum but he refuses; he lives for the hunt as much as the hunters. To seek asylum would be a greater shame for him than being taken alive. As the hunters prepare to take Tosk back Chief O'Brien decides to help Tosk escape so he will avoid humiliation and continue the hunt.This episode centred on Chief O'Brien who was excellently played by Colm Meaney, Scott MacDonald also did well in the role of Tosk. The story was interesting showing that not all cultures have the same values and not everybody who appears to be a victim really is.

He comes aboard DS0 for repairs and O'Brien befriends him and tries to earn his trust to figure out what he is so afraid of. He gets his answer when an advanced alien ship appears from the wormhole and attacks the station, but it quickly becomes apparent that their real target is Tosk. Now the crew of DS9 is faced with a moral dilemma and O'Brien's friendship with Tosk may influence him to put his entire career on the line to help his new friend.Finally we get an episode with the Gamma Quadrant playing a role. I don't know why they waited until the fifth episode to start unpacking this particularly dense web of storytelling potential, but I'm just glad we are here now. The wormhole/Gamma Quadrant will be the driving narrative force for the whole seven seasons of DS9 and it all starts right here, which is very exciting. Furthermore, even though the terms ""Dominion"" or ""Jem'Hadar"" are not mentioned here, this episode definitely foreshadows both. Most obviously: Tosk is very clearly Jem'Hadar or some closely related species created by the Dominion. It seems like a reasonable inference that the Hunters are members of the Dominion and were given slightly altered Jem'Hadar for their hunt (either that or the Hunters created the Tosk and then the Founders liked them so much that they adapted them as their own footsoldiers). Either way, the Dominion connections are clear, though not explicitly stated. This episode is jam packed with story. At one point I thought the episode was probably close to over and checked the time stamp. Nope--there was still almost a third of it remaining. Probably more happens in any one act of this episode than in the entirety of the previous episode. So obviously there is a lot going on but we'll try to get into some of the details.THE GOOD-This story hits all the notes of a classic Trek episode. Moral dilemmas, touching human moments, conflict between Federation and alien value systems, tension and suspense, sci-fi technology, exploring the unknown, and of course, Prime Directive invocations. If you were to design a prototypical good ST episode, this is exactly what it would look like. -Colm Freaking Meaney. This is why they brought him over to DS9; as a starring actor he can do the same thing Patrick Stewart does on TNG by taking an already very good script and making it great with his acting abilities. There is not a warmer or more relatable character in all of ST than Miles Edward O'Brien, and much of that is due to Meaney's talents. -I like the interior design of Tosk's ship. The narrow crawl space to get to the inner workings of the ship feels realistic for a 1-man craft.THE BAD-The action sequences are very primitive and poorly done. Why do Star Trek directors think that combat is two groups of people standing in the open taking turns firing at each other? This isn't 1776.-As good of an actor as he is, Meaney doesn't always sound like he believes his own lines when he has to speak technobabble. The lines in this ep about reversing polarity and bypassing phase inducers sound like an actor reading lines, not an engineer talking about his job.-The episode focuses almost completely on O'Brien, which is nice, but the bad part is that the other characters don't get to do much, including Jadzia and Bashir, who have now played minimal roles in three out of the last four eps.THE UGLY-Miles cutting Bashir off sharply during the scene in Ops. This is the first indication of his dislike for Julian.-Odo Shapeshift count: 1 (picture), 5 total for the series. It seems like my memory of Odo not shifting a lot was faulty, at least so far.",8

The alien, Tosk is nervous about something but needs O'Brien's help to fix his ship. Come to find out Tosk is a member of a sentient species that is hunted for pleasure. Since I find all hunting for pleasure repulsive, I found it hard to swallow the implied message of ""different culture, different values."" I don't think O'Brien was buying that either but he naturally had to concede to Tosk's wishes. Meaney did a wonderful job in this episode and it great seeing him in such a dominant role. This was a thoughtful, interesting and memorable episode but it was a little slow. But that's okay because if every show was non-stop action, that would get boring. So a nice change of pace.",6
0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Q-Less (TV Episode 1993)",Conclusion of the Vash Story Arc from TNG,"John De Lancie and Jennifer Hetrick reprise their TNG roles as omnipotent cosmic pest and ethically-challenged archaeologist. Vash arrives on a ship which appears to be experiencing inexplicable problems. Soon, Q shows up and DS9's crew thinks they've found the explanation for the problems. But it seems that Q has only one thing in mind - convincing Vash to return to his sidecar. As Q becomes more frustrated in his attempts at persuasion, DS9 begins to experience inexplicable problems as well.The plots seems a bit disjointed and - more than once - one has to question the intelligence of the station's safety protocols. But the real purpose of this episode seems to have been to lend DS9 some ratings through the appearance of a popular TNG character (Q) and to resolve the Vash story arc without doing another dull romance between her and Picard.De Lancie's performances have always been heavily dependent on the script he is presented with. This DS9 episode presents Q as the intergalactic trickster, not the child-like god which he typically plays in the heavier TNG Q episodes. The dialog here is written well and both Hetrick and De Lancie do well with their roles.Although I like Vash's risky personality and Jennifer Hetrick's smile, I have to point out - as a professional archaeologist - that it is unlikely that Vash would be permitted to exist for any length of time in a lawfully constituted government, let alone being accepted into a major scientific think-tank. As cool as she may be, she's as much of a looter as Indiana Jones.",6
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Q-Less (TV Episode 1993)",Q visits DS9,"When Dax returns from the Gamma Quadrant the power has been drained from her shuttle and O'Brien must supply power from the station to get in, once inside they are surprised to find she has brought back a human passenger who claims to have been exploring the Delta Quadrant for two years but has no knowledge of the worm hole and declines to say how she got there. The chief recognises her as Vash an archaeologist who he met while serving aboard the Enterprise. She has brought some artefacts back with her and plans to sell them, something Quark is more than happy to help her with. Vash wasn't the only person to arrive, Q has also turned up and it appears that he is up to his old tricks when DS9 starts to experience power shortages. He claims that the power drainage has nothing to do with him, whether he is responsible or not the crew must stop the power drainage before the station is pulled into the worm hole and destroyed.This episode rather assumes that the viewer has watched ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" as no time is wasted in introducing Q. The story itself is good enough although the actual cause of the power loss comes as no great surprise when it is revealed. Vash's character wasn't that interesting and given that she is motivated by greed it was surprising that she only returned from two years in Gamma Quadrant with a handful of items, which may not be as rare as she claims anyway.",7
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Q-Less (TV Episode 1993)",One of the worst Star Trek episodes I've seen,"This episode is pretty much terrible. The appearance of Q seems forced in the first place and the writing is just inconsistent; for instance, is Q omniscient or not? How'd he not spot O'Brian, and so on. The acting throughout is pretty terrible from Dr. Bashir's opening monologue to his corny ending joke line. In between, we have a silly story arc that just isn't very captivating. This entire cast seems to lack charisma and verisimilitude. Even when his entire station is at risk, Cisco barely even seems to get his blood pressure up. I feel like the director should have been shouting, ""People, your lives are supposed to be at stake!"". Even the auction feels like a high-school production instead of a prime-time TV show and resembles in no way a convincing real-life auction.",2
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Q-Less (TV Episode 1993)",Not particularly logical...,"The show features Vash arriving at Deep Space 9. If you don't remember, Vash is a lady friend of Captain Picard and she appeared in a few episodes of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". This character was enjoyable but never made a lot of sense regarding her relationship with Picard, as she is clearly amoral and steals antiquities--so why would the very straight-laced and very moralistic Picard like her? What doesn't make sense in this episode is her relationship with Q. Although Q is all-powerful and clearly very condescending, he chases after her like a love-starved puppy-- almost constantly begging her to rejoin him in adventures. What also didn't make a lot of sense is Q's stating that he knows everything--yet didn't remember Miles O'Brien when they meet once again. And, speaking of not making sense, why did EVERYONE on the ship behave so incredibly calmly and non-emotive when the station was about to be torn apart?! Logic is NOT a strong suit in this episode!Despite all these and several other inconsistencies, the show is enjoyable enough. Q is always enjoyable (well, maybe not so much in the old Farpoint episode) and his banter with Vash is nice.",4
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Q-Less (TV Episode 1993)",Q and Vash,"One of my favorite DS9 episodes has a couple of recurring characters from TNG

wormhole. Q makes an appearance later and makes known that he wants Vash
back whom he finds as appealing as as Jean Luc Picard did at one time. But
Vash is all about the latinum as she partners with Quark for profit to sell her
artifacts.Meantime the station itself is draining power in fits and starts, but might be
dragged into the wormhole.I love this episode, especially Hetrick negotiating with Armin Shimmerman. She has great knowledge of other cultures, even their erogenous zones. Seeing
her work on Quark is worth this whole episode.",8

Why this is, I don't know. He has control over the universe. Why mess around with mere mortals. As for Vash, I found her tiresome and uninteresting in TNG, and, once again, she is tiresome and uninteresting. Please don't have either of them return.",5

It's not long before Q himself shows up and starts to annoy the crew of DS9 in his uniquely irritating way. But with him and Vash also arrives a new danger that threatens the station. Will Sisko's crew be able to figure out what is happening before the station is destroyed? Is Q responsible? How does Vash fit into what is happening?So for the third time in six episodes, we get crossover characters from TNG, cementing even further that these shows are tightly linked and not afraid to build off of each other. Q is almost always a treat on TNG, and the episodes he appears in are some of the best from that show (with a couple of exceptions). This would be his only appearance on DS9 and it's not too hard to see why. The energy that John de Lancie brings to the screen with this character is incredible, but his chemistry with Sisko is...well...frankly nonexistent--a far cry from the world-class dialogue filled with Shakespeare quotes and historical allusions he exchanges with Patrick Stewart over on the sister show. Part of that is due to Brooks' far inferior acting talents, but part of it simply Sisko's personality. He does not tolerate BS and Q is pretty much the definition of BS.The scenes with Vash and Q are good though. And with Vash and Quark. Basically Vash is always a highlight. I'm surprised Jennifer Hetrick never got more roles back in the day because she steals the show in all of her Star Trek appearances. And despite not having Picard to banter with, de Lancie is still very entertaining as the enigmatic Q.The story is well-written here too. The suspense is maintained right up until the end and it's fun to try and guess whether or not Q is nudging things one way or another to help or simply for his own amusement. As usual, even by the end of the ep we really have no idea what his intentions were.THE GOOD-O'Brien's face in the opening shot. His reactions to Bashir's whole Starfleet Medical finals story is amazing. We see a continuation of O'Brien's strong dislike for him from the last ep.-O'Brien describing Vash ""The captain likes a good challenge, sir."" Way to put it diplomatically, Miles.-O'Brien on seeing Q on DS9 ""Bloody hell!"" Colm Meaney could have a YouTube channel called ""O'Brien Reacts to Things"" and I'd watch the hell out of it.-Quark is so wonderfully sleazy here. It's a credit to Armin Shimerman's acting talent that he can be charismatic with a giant latex mask and fangs on.THE BAD-Some cringy scenes with Bashir. The opening scene when he's telling about his medical finals like it's a war story is delightfully campy, but him hitting on Vash is more weird than fun.-Aside from being the link to Vash, Q really doesn't do much here story-wise. He's pretty superfluous aside from acting as a red herring. Again, it's no surprise he doesn't return to DS9. He just doesn't fit the tone of the show.THE UGLY-How much must it enrage Sisko to get continuously compared to Picard by Q? I feel kind of bad for him because every time that name is mentioned, it must remind him of the death of his wife. No wonder he's so surly with Q.-The gas used to trace the power drains, tritium, is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. It is indeed very toxic when inhaled, but how it would make changes in the graviton field easier to detect is a mystery since gravitons are currently still only hypothetical.-It's somewhat subtle, but Q actually appears to help the crew figure out the mystery (or tries anyway). When they are blaming him, he reacts by insulting them but then says that while they are trying to figure it out, Vash is ""engaged in base commerce"" and says that she is the real danger. This seems to be his MO--be annoying and belittling and pretend not to care while subtly helping the crew survive a serious threat. It's strange that he can simultaneously be both childish and paternal. Of all the many great characters in the history of Trek, Q has to be one of the most enigmatic.-Bashir retcon watch (WARNING: this section contains major spoilers for a future story arc) -- First mention of him mistaking a preganglionic fiber for a postganglionic nerve on his Starfleet Medical finals. We learn much later on that he missed that question on purpose so as to not draw suspicion about his genetically-enhanced nature.-Odo shapeshift count: none on screen, but it's implied that he was the wine bottle in one scene.",7
0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Dax (TV Episode 1993)",Solid Character Development,"This is one of the more affective character development episodes in DS9. We learn a lot about Jadzia Dax - or more correctly, Dax, the symbiont whose memory and personality Jadzia's personality is welded to. Dax is on trial for extradition to a planet where a previous incarnation - Sisko's friend Curzon Dax has apparently committed treason. Sisko comes to his/her defense, and argues, seemingly untenably, that Jadzia is not responsible for Curzon's acts. Jadzia refuses to defend herself. Meanwhile, Odo digs farther and deeper.What I found very interesting about this episode is how Jadzia, Curzon and Dax's characters are so well illustrated in this episode with very little dialog or even facial expressions from them. Farrell, Brooks, and two of the guest stars - Fionnula Flanagan and Gregory Itzn stand out for acting in this one. The script is very good but also check out GlorieuxJ's enlightening review - I had no idea! The cinematography and directing are up the series' usual high standard.",7

DS9 pulls the runaway vessel back with a tractor beam. But Ilon insists he has the right to take Dax back to Klaestron for crimes committed 30 years ago by Curzon Dax. According to Ilon, his father General Tandro was murdered by Curzon and betrayed by him even though his father and Curzon were thought to be great friends. General Tandro's memory is now revered as a martyr to freedom. To sort it out, a Bajoran arbitrator holds a hearing to determine if Jadzia Dax is indeed responsible for a crime supposedly committed by Curzon Dax. Throughout the hearing Jadzia is curiously passive and will say nothing in her defense. The highlight of the episode is Fionnula Flanagan's performance as General Tandro's widow, Enina. The back and forth between the opposing sides at the hearing is fascinating but Enina brings the hearing to an abrupt end by telling the truth about what really happened 30 years ago. To find that our heroes often have feet of clay is always sobering.",8
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Dax (TV Episode 1993)",The Klaestron Arbitrator,"This episode is necessary character development for the Dax character, is the Host guilty of crimes of the Symbiote? That is the question posed for Arbiter Anne Haney (Renora) — a 100-year old Bajoran woman.The Sisko is defending Jadzia-Dax while Ilon Tandro (Gregory Itzin), A Klaestron, prosecutes the case against Curzon-Dax.At the beginning of this episode, Tandro abducts Dax with the help of Spice Williams (""Vixis"" from Star Wreck V) and a another Trill man hiding in the shadows (Selin Peers- Richard Lineback). Vixis cold-cocks Bashir after he pulls off her hood, revealing a Klaestron Woman. She then beats the crap out of him, but he manages to call for help in a dazed state, and at the last minute Tandro is prevented from Trill-napping Jadzia.If successful, The Klaestron's abduction of Jadzia would have been upheld because of Federation Treaties with that planet. However, the abduction occurs on a Bajoran Station, and Bajor has no such treaty, making it an illegal abduction. And as the Klaestrons are pals of the Cardassians, this ""annoys"" The Bajorans, and specifically Major Kira.Dax is accused of murdering Tandro's father, a famous Klaestronian General: 30 years in the past: And then giving secret codes to certain rebels. But that was Curzon-Dax, Jadzia had not even been thought of by her parents yet.The Sisko from his past association with Curzon-Dax knows for a fact he would not have killed anyone, but how to prove it? By twisting Trill law to all ways it can be twisted.It is unclear what the Arbiter will find, for Tandro, or The Sisko, until Tandro's mother Enina (Fionnula Flanagan) shows up, with some shocking facts: Curzon could not have been killing General Tandro, because he was at that very moment making the beast with two backs with his wife! And it was The General Himself that gave the secrets to the rebels, who killed him for it in gratitude.That the writers and producers of DS9 would bring this information out, is a merit to 1990s Syndicated Television: Which was slightly less strict than Network TV: This subject matter was treated as gently as possible and still to have it's shocking effect: The information is dumped out in the last 5 minutes of the episode.It is to be noted that Curzon, a basic Alpha-Male, is was never portrayed as the drooling testosterone driven type, and that he actually had feelings for Enina, and those feelings and the secret of the encounter was kept by Curzon to his death, so as not to make a scandal.This was why, initially, Jadzia-Dax will not defend herself, she would have been put to death herself to protect Enina.In the end, it was the great Fionnula Flanagan's character that decided that it was time to tell this secret, the memory of General Tandro would not be hurt by this knowledge: He has been elevated to Hero and Martyr status.",10
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Dax (TV Episode 1993)",Terrible Law,"I found the premise of this episode to be interesting - loosely inspired I believe by ""The Measure of a Man"" in The Next Generation - but I found the arguments regarding consciousness-fusing weak and the law absolutely terrible. While ostensibly a trial-based episode, most of the characters simply made random speeches whenever they felt like, without even the phantom of actual legal procedure to make any sense of it all. Everyone just keeps saying ""it's an informal hearing"", as if that's an excuse for them not knowing the first thing about courtroom law. Sicko appears more are a zealot then the cerebral Picard's arguments, the plot relies heavily on deux ex machina, and a lot of it is just downright illogical.Watch this for the explanation of trill physiology ONLY. Better yet, just read it on Memory Alpha.",
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Dax (TV Episode 1993)",Very interesting coincidence,"I am not really rating this episode, but I simply want to point out the very interesting coincidence that the main underlying plot for it, i.e., an extradition hearing (here for Lieutenant Dax), is the same as that of Episode 10 of the fourth season of Northern Exposure (entitled ""Crime and Punishment"") that aired exactly two months earlier (12/14/92) and centered around an extradition hearing for ""Chris in the morning"". In both cases the somewhat improvised defense was successfully made on the grounds that the person being sought for extradition was no longer the same as the one who had committed the alleged crime (murder for Lt. Dax, parole violation for Chris) as a result of an extensive change of their personality (changing host body for Lt. Dax, becoming a radio show host for Chris). The ""icing on the cake"" is that for both episodes the hearing judge is played by the SAME actress, Anne Haney.",
5,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Dax (TV Episode 1993)",Sins of the previous host,Shortly after this episode opens a group of aliens attempts to kidnap Jadzia Dax from DS9. They almost get away with her but are caught in the station's tractor beam. Once caught they claim that they are extraditing her for capital crimes committed by Dax's previous host Curzon. They claim they must be allowed to take her due to extradition treaties with the Federation however Sisko points out that DS9 might be run by the Federation but it is in fact Bajoran territory so they will have to have a hearing in front of a Bajoran arbiter. While the two sides set out their arguments Jadzia is strangely quiet and Odo goes to Klaesron to see if he can find out what happened there thirty years before.This episode gave an interesting insight into Dax's character despite the fact that she doesn't say much. It nicely explores the morality of holding holding one host responsible for the sins of the previous host and whether it is the host or the symbiont which is responsible. While these questions aren't really answered we do see that Jadzia is willing to risk her life to protect the reputation of somebody Curzon once cared for.,8

He then learns that the trio have a valid extradition order for the arrest of Curzon Dax--the name given to the being that held Dax before it was recently paired with Jadzia. He also learns that the crimes he/she is wanted for are treason and murder! This certainly would not be like Curzon Dax-- yet, inexplicably, Jadzia Dax offers no defense at all!

Jadzia Dax to try her for treason allegedly committed by the former Dax host, Curzon, who was also Commander Sisko's close friend and mentor. Sisko is able to force an extradition hearing arbitrated by a Bajoran representative to attempt to determine whether or not Jadzia can be tried for the crimes of which her predecessor is accused.Star Trek has a number of good courtroom drama episodes, with ""The Measure of a Man"" from TNG's second season leading that impressive collection. ""Dax"" does not unfortunately find a place among those quality stories. While the premise sounds like it could be interesting, the execution does not live up and the writers failed to make any relevant connection to contemporary social issues (at least that I could discern). The ""drama"" here is flat, the social commentary absent, and the acting dull and lifeless--in strong contrast to the aforementioned legendary episode from the sister show--all of which adds up to a below-average episode in this first season.THE GOOD-It's nice to finally get an episode centered on Dax. She has been seriously neglected as a character up to this point, including the aspects of her complicated relationship to Sisko, and this episode does a bit to explore that relationship. Unfortunately, it ends up mostly being Avery Brooks' mediocre dialogue delivery versus Terry Farrell's stoic silence (which she does well, but it's just not interesting).-Does a good job of demonstrating how, even though she appears to be a young woman, Jadzia has the integrity and conviction of someone much older and wiser. That is really the only lasting takeaway from the ep.-The shot where the tractor beam chases the Klaestron ship off the screen and then a few seconds later drags it back onto frame is great. Nice blending of quality effects with creative shot design.-The cranky old Bajoran arbiter is amusing. She is the only one who isn't phoning in her performance here.THE BAD-Ironically, in the episode that bears her name and is ostensibly all about her, Dax herself does almost nothing here.-The story is honestly boring. The ending is a rushed and anticlimactic deus ex machina.-I hate to keep comparing this episode to ""The Measure of a Man,"" but every courtroom drama ST ep naturally is benchmarked against that great ep. What is lacking here is...literally everything. The acting is far inferior. There are no epic speeches. No thrilling dramatic moments (by contrast, Riker's ""Pinocchio's strings have been cut"" moment still gives me goosebumps to this day). No important social commentary. ""TMoaM"" had so many powerful things to say about slavery, consciousness, free will, and more. What is the relevance of this ep? Are they commenting on the importance of redemption? Something about amnesia? I have no clue. It all feels so pointless, especially with the abrupt and unsatisfying ending.THE UGLY-First mention of the Klingon coffee, raktajino, which would become a station favorite, essentially replacing Earth coffee on the show.-Bashir's flying elbow into the Klaestron agent trying to abduct Dax looks like something Kirk would try. The whole brawl was sloppy like a TOS fight, which I found surprisingly entertaining.-Bashir retcon watch (WARNING: this section contains major spoilers for a future story arc) -- With the way Bashir's physical abilities are portrayed post-genetic-engineering reveal, he should have been more coordinated during the critical fight to try and rescue Jadzia from the Klaestron abductors. Instead he looks like an adolescent who doesn't understand how human limbs work. He looks like Gumby getting electric shock therapy. The closest we've ever come to a real life version of a Bethesda game glitch was Bashir's ""fight scene."" It's bad, is what I'm saying.-It seems highly unlikely that the culpability of current hosts for the crimes of former hosts would not be an issue that would have previously been settled by Trill law, and thus would serve as a guide for the proceedings of this ep. And yet no such precedence is ever mentioned.",5
0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Passenger (TV Episode 1993)",Alien possession,"This stand alone episode wasn't as good as it might have been; it started well enough when Kira and Bashir respond to a distress call and find Ty Kjiada and her prisoner Rao Vantika aboard a burning ship. Bashir is told to leave Vantaka as he is dangerous but goes to his aid anyway, he briefly awakens and grabs the doctor by the throat but apparently overcome by his injuries he survives. Kjiada is convinced that her prisoner has somehow survived and requests a vast array of tests all of which seem to show he is dead. Dead or not it appears that somebody has been interfering with the station's computers in a way that Vantika has been known to use. The timing is suspicious too as a shipment from the Gamma Quadrant is due soon and this would help Vantika extend his life; something he was obsessed with. The investigation is slightly hampered by the fact that new Star Fleet security officer clashes with Odo although Sisko soon makes sure that they both know Odo is on charge in joint operations.I liked James Lashly as Lt. George Primmin the new Star Fleet security officer, it felt like they were setting him up to be a regular character. The story went well until the end when we learnt that Vantaka had somehow transferred his consciousness into the doctor; we could tell he wasn't himself as he spoke in a most unnatural manner when that personality was showing, I can only assume this was the director's choice as Alexander Siddig is a good actor who can do much better.",7

Then think of a story well written that deceives both the mind and the soul. This is what ""The Passenger"" promised yet did not deliver; a huge thud.As I have explained above it was not the idea or writing of this episode that disappoints. Rather, it is the lack of execution on the part of Siddig and director Paul Lynch that causes the thud in this episode. Siddig is burdened in the role, evidenced by his performance in the last scene when he is overcome by Rao Vantika's persona. Burdened with the fact that his acting, at this point in his career, is soap opera quality at best. He reminds me of a Garret Wang on ""Voyager""; forced to play science fiction dramatic roles without having the ability to do just that. Moreover, why does director Paul Lynch allow this to happen? Some direction for Siddig would have been nice; like ""can you stop talking like a robot in supposed ""climax"" and get the lines out before the audience falls asleep"".With that said, the writing and idea save this episode from a 5 out of 10.6 out of 10",6

Guest star Julie Caitlin Brown also turns in a convincing performance as the cold and ruthless Ty Kajada, and we get to learn a bit more about the relationship between Odo and Sisko here, too. Excellent direction by Paul Lynch keeps you constantly guessing in this suspenseful adventure that plays very much like an Alfred Hitchcock spy mystery.The only weak link in the chain is that of Lieutenant Primmin, played sincerely but ineffectively by James Lashly. The fault here is not so much Lashly's performance as it is the fact that he is simply miscast in this role; his affable manner and genial appearance do not make him threatening enough to be believable to be as a member of the intimidating & mysterious Starfleet Security (sort of like John Goodman trying to play a CIA agent- good actor, but wrong part). Apparently, the producers felt the same, way, too, for after one more appearance in the next episode, ""Move Along Home"", Lt.

Ty Kajada is an Alien Policewoman of the same Alien Species, obsessed with Vantika.. and also obsessed with bringing him to Justice.But Vantika is a genius. he's used all manner of tricks to prolong his life, extending it to the maximum that his species will allow.But the Prisoner transport he is being hauled in, somehow catches fire and he dies. End of Story? Not by a long-shot.Lt. Primmin, the Federation Security Liaison assigned to DS9, is tasked with protecting the shipment of some stuff called ""Deuridium"" which has some kind of Life-Preserving properties - This stuff is a Planetary Shipment, being sent to the home planet of Ty Kajada and Rao Vantika. Well, for some reason, Vantika wants this stuff - And he'll do anything - Including rise from the Dead, to get it! Kajada is not convinced Vantika is dead, he's faked his death so many times before. And in fact, things start happening on the Station that point to him being alive... But How? The DS9 team figures it out - Too late. Vantika has taken possession of a member of the DS9 crew... but which one? This is the question asked here. Who is it, Who Done it? And the ""Science"" gimmick of this ep, is the premise, that a Human Mind is not using all of it's capacity at any given moment - So there is room enough in the Human Brain's Neural Pathways, to store more than one ENTIRE personality. Which is a startling answer to this conundrum. The question becomes ""Who Goes There?"" - Which is the main gimmick in the 1930's Sci Fi story of the same name by John W Campbell.This Ep reflects some of the best golden age Sci Fi stories ever written: ""Passengers"" by Robert Silverberg - Beings that can take over any human body and use it as a plaything, leaving the host personality unable to do anything about it... Kind of like a reverse Dax, and the Hosts the passengers take have no say in the matter.Then there is ""A Plague of Pythons"" by Fred Pohl - There is a small conclave of humans that can don a headset and take over any human body on Earth. That story does not bode well for the people who made the headsets- The hero of the story gets control of all the headsets and kills them all.""The Puppet Masters"" by Robert A Heinlein, which reflects an invasion of Slug-like creatures (Sound Familiar, Dax?) that can attach to any human brainstem and it creates a merged being, LIKE the Dax symbiote- But the ""Slugs"" are Malevolent.There is even a reference to ""The Hidden"" - An 80's sci-fi flick starring Kyle MacLachlan and Mike Nouri where there is a race that can do the same thing: IE, take control of a host body for a short time, abuse it, get it killed, then move to another host.There is a very large hint of these stories in this great DS9 Ep written by Hugo Award Winner Morgan Grendel of Next Gen Ep ""The Inner Light"" - And it took one of the regular DS9 Actors to pull it off. Can't say which one, as I put enough spoilers in my reviews... Let's just say the guy they put Vantika IN, was a newbie to US Television.The way this ep moves, is creepy. We never find out who Vantika is traveling in, but when it is finally revealed, it is a shock and a kick in the Arse. Now it was said in another review that the actor who ""Had Vantika In Him""- when he had to BE Vantika, that this actor was wooden. I highly object! I think they did a great job, putting on a personality that was different than the DS9 character they usually portray! So we have a very creepy story, and everything that happens is misdirection. There are quite a few Macguffins in this Ep- We are totally fooled until the very last reveal. A great Ep in the first season of DS9 which revealed the possibilities of where this show could ultimately go.",10

I was perplexed for several minutes trying to justify what I just saw.Ty kajada, standing next to three federation officers, executes Rao Vantika without them even blinking an eye. Further from it; these officers were eye-browing one another with a hint of a smile on their faces! It's strange how 3 federation officers who are subject to the prime directive, which holds sentient life in very high regard, can so easily choose to ignore it.What were the writer and director thinking when they made Ty Kajada pull the trigger? Rao Vantika has no body so there's no problem if she executes him without a trial? Is this what we want to teach the viewers? It's alright to kill a sentient being if it has no physical form? There's lots of star trek episodes that show otherwise. The federation even has a robot and a hologram in its ranks who both are classified as being sentient. Granted it took some effort and several hearings to get to that place.So what is it that made Rao's life so worthless in the eyes of the writer/director. Is it because he's a murderer? No. Because even murderers deserve a trial in the star trek universe.Shortsighted is the only answer I can think of.",7

After returning to DS9, Bashir tries to assure Ty Kayada that Vantaka is indeed dead. she's having none of it; she has been pursuing Vantaka for years and knows how wily and evil he is and that he would go to any lengths to prolong his life. It was interesting to read reviewer remarks about the origins of this concept in the works of classic science fiction writers. However, I found this episode to be pretty boring and Siddig's performance an unconvincing distraction. His performance in the final scene whether done deliberately or not, was overblown. Even so, as with all DS9 episodes, this is still worth a watch.",6

Oddly, Ty warns the two that although Rao appears dead, they should NOT assume this is true! In fact, when she later awakens in sick bay, Ty once again tells them that Rao MIGHT still somehow be alive. Apparently, Ty is some sort of evil scientist who has been trying to reach immortality. Despite Ty's many warnings, the crew miss the message. And, when it becomes apparent Rao IS somehow alive, they assume his evil essence is within Ty--even though SHE was warning them all along! Despite the crew being dumber than a sack of doorknobs, this is still a decent episode. And, even with some overacting towards the end, the plot is just too interesting for the show not to work regardless. Not a shining moment...but worth seeing.",6

They rescue the lone survivor, an alien security officer, but are unable to save her prisoner, a man named Vantika whom she claims is extremely dangerous. Upon returning to the station, someone begins tampering with station security and appears to be plotting to steal an inbound shipment of rare material, and all evidence points to Vantika being the one responsible for the issues. But how can that be if he is dead?This is another inconsequential episode, although the wormhole does at least play a small part, as the shipment of deuridium is coming from the Gamma Quadrant. The tension and pacing are both decent. Unlike the previous episode, the performances of the actors are all very good (with one very obvious and notable exception). Sisko, Quark, Odo, and Jadzia all gets chances to shine and their performances are what make this a slightly above-average ep.THE GOOD-""If you want my opinion--"" ""Actually I don't."" Man I love Sisko's no-BS attitude. His handling of Odo's wounded pride is also very impressive. You gain a lot of admiration for Sisko's ability to command in this episode. He is fair but doesn't tolerate any nonsense.-As mentioned above, several characters have multiple noteworthy moments. Rene Auberjonois steals the show though. Every scene with him is great, from his conflicts with Lt. Primmin, to his banter with Quark, to his no-holds-barred conversation with Sisko. And even though Odo is too hard on Primmin at first, he knows when he was wrong and gives him due credit at the end, showing he is a fair, if harsh, judge of character.THE BAD-Oh my Prime Directive is Alexander Siddig bad here. So, so bad. Especially the scenes where he plays Vantika. I never realized what an awful actor he was in the first season until this time rewatching the show. Fortunately, he does improve as the show proceeds and has actually had a very successful acting career post-Star Trek. But boy is he bad here.-Maybe it's because I've seen the episode several times before, but it seemed painfully obvious to me that Bashir was the bad guy all along. There was no mystery that I could discern. However, in spite of knowing I still felt the tension from seeing Bashir/Vantika skulk around the station and mess everything up, so that's a positive at least.-Going off the above ""bad,"" it's baffling to me that nobody suspected Bashir, especially Jadzia after discovering how Vantika had survived, or Kira after seeing Vantika grab Bashir right before dying. Definitely makes the crew look incompetent.-No O'Brien for the second episode in a row.THE UGLY-PLOT HOLE: Now that Vantika has a new (human) body, he no longer has any need for the deuridium since he originally wanted it to prolong his life. None of his actions after the first scene make any sense in that light. He hangs around the station and waits to get caught for...absolutely no reason.-Runabout used: Rio Grande multiple times-The material that Vantika is trying to steal, deuridium, is apparently fictional.-The freighter carrying the deuridium has Federation LCARS control interfaces, in spite of not being crewed by Starfleet personnel. That would explain how Bashir knew exactly what button to push to lower the shields, even in his disoriented state.-Glial cells are what Vantika uses to transfer his consciousness into Bashir, but it's unclear how that would work since glial cells are non-neuronal, but are rather part of the central nervous system that surrounds and cares for the neural tissue.",6

She has been obsessed for years and has seen some of the things he is capable of and can't accept the findings of the doctor and the crew. Eventually, there is a transfer of his consciousness.

0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Move Along Home (TV Episode 1993)",Uggh!!,"Avery Brooks didn't apparently like this episode according to IMDb and after seeing the show, I can certainly understand why. It's simply a bad episode...one that is inexplicably stupid.The Wadi are a race of folks who just came from the Gamma Quadrant. Oddly, instead of initiating normal diplomatic or first contact behaviors, these weirdos are solely interested in going to Quark's place and gambling. At first, Quark thinks they are a bunch of easy marks but soon they turn out to be gambling savants. So far, so good. However, when they show Quark one of their games, the command staff disappear and find themselves in some sort of live action game much like a platformer game. None of the show makes any sense...none. And, after kidnapping the crew and scaring the crap out of them, the Wadi just leave and the episode ends. Huh?! Poorly written...and in a way that might just make you cringe.UPDATE: By the way, it isn't just me who hated this episode. At the 50th anniversary Star Trek convention in Las Vegas, this was voted as one of the 10 worst of all episodes from every Trek franchise! That is some ignoble designation!",3
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Move Along Home (TV Episode 1993)",One of the more forgettable shows of the first season...,"An interesting story idea with great potential that suffers from sub-standard writing, direction, and acting, ""Move Along Home"" comes off as weak and contrived, all the more so because the previous episode, ""The Passenger"", was so powerful and compelling. The whole episode seems rushed and thrown together, without much thought given to plot, character development, or even costuming.We are introduced to a new species, the ""Wadi"", who, we are told beforehand, are focused as a culture on the concept of games. Following much fanfare and anticipation, our initial meeting is disappointing- after being treated throughout the series to visually spectacular species- with complex motivations- such as the Klingons, Cardassions, and Ferengi, the Wadi come off as so human and familiar in appearance & mannerisms that they give the impression of a group of co-workers dressed up for the office Halloween party. With their somewhat cheesy, economical looking sparkly costumes, painted-on forehead tattoos, and very human behavior, they seem better suited as characters for TOS than for DS9, and their whole appearance screams of ""let's cut some corners on wardrobe & make-up budget this week"".The Wadi are played rather lamely by some forgettable television actors who, other than the leader, don't contribute much other than exaggerated facial expressions. The Wadi leader does attempt to inject a little passion into his performance, but he overacts badly at times and comes off as mysterious & menacing as a zany dad in a McDonald's commercial.The excellent regulars in the series- Sisko, Dax, Odo, etc., do the best they can, but it's obvious they're struggling with a lackluster script and mediocre directing so they don't have much to work with. The game that they find themselves trapped in is supposed to be dangerous, a perilous ""life or death"" situation, yet the dialogue and acting is so devoid of passion or intensity that this never really comes across as convincing or believable. The result is an episode where I found myself just as interested in answering my text messages as I was watching the screen.And it would take a whole separate review just to list all the plot holes- if the situation IS life or death, and Odo IS genuinely concerned about the safety and recovery of the senior officers, why does he meekly play along from the very start instead of immediately arresting the Wadi and demanding the immediate return of the crew? It's his station, his crew, his responsibility, and his rules- yet he sure doesn't act like it. And what about the Starfleet Intelligence Officer working in OPS- the entire senior staff has been missing for a day and he isn't concerned? Not very believable.Luckily, Star Trek is like pizza, beer, or cigars- even when they're bad, they're still pretty good. If you're a die-hard Trekker, you may want to watch this one, if for no other reason that it makes you appreciate the better made episodes all the more. For anyone else, you may want to pass.",4
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Move Along Home (TV Episode 1993)",Caught in a game,"When The Wadi, a new species from the Gamma Quadrant, come through the worm hole they are formally greeted by Sisko, Kira, Dax and Dr. Bashir but don't seem to impressed; the person they want to see is Quark as they have heard he has games and that is what interests them most. Keen to make a good first impression they are taken to Quarks and proceed to do rather well at the tables... so well in fact that Quark resorts to cheating to get his money back. When they catch him they invite him to play a game of theirs... what Quark doesn't know is that when the game starts Sisko, Kira, Dax and Dr. Bashir are taken into the game where they must solve puzzles to progress to the next level. When the crew members disappearance is noticed Odo goes to Quarks and asks him if he knows anything, at this point Quark realises that he is in fact playing with their lives. Soon Dr. Bashir is taken out of the game and is presumed to be dead, then Quark rolls the dice and is told another player must be taken out of the game and he must choose which it is to be; unable to decide he grovels till the Wadi leader says he will let the game decide who is to die although as it turns out they all fail the final test... of course it turns out that it is just a game and they are all okay including the doctor although they aren't pleased with the Wadi or Quark.While this wasn't the greatest episode I found it to be memorable and when I first watched it thought it was possible that a character might die, after all less than a dozen episodes had passed so the creators might not like a character or an actor might not have wanted to stay on. Even watching it again when I knew nobody would be harmed I rather enjoyed it. The Wadi themselves are fairly forgettable however; apart from a strange dress sense and some colourful markings on they foreheads they look human.",7

4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Move Along Home (TV Episode 1993)",Not the best.,"Haven't seen this in a long time and it is not the best episode of DS9, but like early TNG episodes, early DS9 episodes tent to get better over time. When this episode and DS9 first aired, I did not like it very much, now I like it. When Voyager first aired I did not like it either and I hoped that the same would happen, what happened to DS9 a couple of years earlier. But it never happened. This is actually very entertaining with kind of a surprise ending. Just watch it, you will like it. The characters are not fully developed yet and feel fresh.",6
5,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Move Along Home (TV Episode 1993)","Space, Baby. Deep Space.","Well we're midway through the first season of Deep Space Nine and I figure this is as good an episode as any to take a look at the series as a whole so far. I've been a huge fan of the original Star Trek series, the films, and the Next Generation, but I've only recently decided to work my way through DS9... I had heard mostly good things from Trek fans. I'm only ten episodes in, but here's my take on what works and what doesn't.The Good: Avery Brooks as Captain Sisko. I already like the actor and the character he plays: he's got a quiet, introspective presence which works very well. It's also a nice change to see a Star Trek captain who isn't trying too hard to be authoritative or iron-willed: Sisko seems perfectly comfortable as head of the space station and Brooks is engaging and leaves me wanting more.The Setting. What I thought would be detrimental to a Trek franchise- a stationery headquarters as opposed to a propulsive ship boldy going where no man has gone before- has actually turned out to be a positive: there's a stability to the DS9 station that I actually find comforting, especially with the ambient outer-space white noise in the background.Quark. Boy was I ready to hate this character. In the few episodes I saw during DS9's original run I got the impression that Quark was an over-the-top greedy goofball, an alien bartender/host who was as much of a Gremlin as he was a Ferengi. I've been pleasantly surprised so far by the understatement of the character and Armin Shimerman's performance. If you've ever witnessed the neurotic nightmare Neelix on Voyager you thank the prophets for Quark's quiet dignity.Odo. My favorite character so far. We don't know much about him yet but he has an air of mystery and steely determination that you don't usually find in a shapeshifter. I hope we get more episodes and backstory on him as the series continues.The Not-So-Good: Nana Visitor as Major Kira. So far she's been bland and forgettable. Definitely room for the character to grow. Also who names their kid Nana? Chief O'Brien & Keiko. It's great to see Colm Meany from TNG, but so far he's offered little in terms of character or performance, and Keiko is the dramatic equivalent of a Styrofoam peanut. My favorite was the episode where she smiled and nodded.The Ugly: Alexander Siddig as Dr. Bashir. Vaguely-British, vaguely good-looking and thus far almost entirely useless. He's like a department store mannequin modeling a mock turtleneck. Bashir seems to have two emotional settings: Mildly Surprised and Daydreaming About Donuts.Terry Farrell as Dax. This is a joke, right? Good one. Now bring out the REAL actress. Farrell is not only corpse-like and comatose in facial expression and flat, stilted vocals, she's physically stiff as a plank when her character is required to move. In this episode she has to play hopscotch and follow a little girl's steps. Farrell looks like a newborn calf whose legs are not yet connected to her brain pan. There are not enough stool softeners in the world to cure her dead eyes and bland symmetrical forehead freckles. Seriously, the woman has been a crime against acting, and as we all know Star Trek is not Shakespeare. The only thing worse than Bashir & Dax is Bashir & Dax TOGETHER, sharing a chemistry-free flirtation and failing to connect as performers on any level. These two can only get better from here on out, because they surely can't get any worse.But back to the episode: ""Move Along Home"" is a familiar but fun Trek expedition as the crew of DS9 are forced to play as pawns in an alien culture's game after Quark is caught cheating. I like what I see from Deep Space Nine... it's a chill, mellow Trek, a subtle fine wine in comparison to TOS' whiskey on the rocks and TNG's vodka martini. I'll keep checking in as I get farther in... so far it's worth the trip.The series so far: B+",8
6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Move Along Home (TV Episode 1993)",Worst Episode Ever,"The writer is also responsible for the only 'Enterprise' episode I never watched in entirety: 'Acquisition' - so this writer has written my least favorite DS9 and my least favorite 'Enterprise' episodes - Congrats! go to Arnoud Tiele. He also is responsible for such horrors as 'American Psycho II' and DS9 'Babel' another very weak episode, and other crimes against entertainment. The main characters just look idiotic as they go through their little dances and rhymes. 'Hopscotch in space' would have been a better name for the episode. The beginning was poorly done, the middle just insulting and difficult to endure. The ending was stupid, we all knew they were never in any danger... If you never see this episode you won't be missing anything. It reminds me of the 'Voyager' episode where they go into the clown world with Michael McKean 'The Thaw', although I don't hate this episode as much as I truly hate 'The Thaw' - if given a choice, I would probably suffer through this episode before 'The Thaw'... Part of their contract with the Devil is that they had to make each Star Trek season 1 terrible. Where Gene R., R. Berman and Co. were forced to make Season 1 bad. TNG Season 1 was bad. 'Enterprise' was bad up until all of a sudden it got amazing in the middle of season 2 - I almost didn't make it that far, but I'm glad I pushed through. 'Cogenitor' was an amazing episode, followed by the Borg episode which was also cool. 'Voyagers' worst episodes were mostly in Season 1... the Kazon sucked (discount Delta Quadrant Klingons) DS9 Season 1 was fairly slow, but not quite as bad as the other 2, because at least they had a decent story arc to play with, unlike the true 'Serialization' of TNG and TOS. I was always bummed that the TNG episodes didn't tie in with one another, and they followed this predictable format of ""Problem, Reaction, Solution"" all taking place in the space of three -15 minute increments. Especially Season 1 of TNG, how quick and easy they were able to destroy and then save the universe in succinct 15 minute segments and 45 minute episodes, and yet come back to do it all again the next week with no consequences from anything that had come before. We can thank the producers and their greed, a lot of writers of TNG wanted to write more connecting episodes, but they weren't allowed to by Berman because of re-run syndication money greed, it was easier to syndicate a show when each show was a separate entity and didn't have to be played in any order... When I was a child watching TNG, I always wondered why they didn't tie in the episodes more, which I would have greatly preferred. Oh, and don't get me started on the horror that is 'Discovery' Season 1 - Season 2 promises to be a bit better if it follows the Devil's contract.",1
7,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Move Along Home (TV Episode 1993)",Lightweight but enjoyable episode,"Sisko and his executive team of Kira, Dax and Bashir prepare to greet the Wadi, first time visitors from the Gamma Quadrant. But the Wadi are not interested in any discussions with the team, they only want to go to Quark's place. The Wadi, led by Falow (wonderfully played by Joel Brooks) love games - and are very good at them and quickly and repeatedly win at the dabo tables. Quark doesn't like this and of course resorts to cheating, a ploy that is soon discovered by the Wadi. The Wadi force Quark to play a game of theirs involving players having to move from one tier (which they call chap) to another. The thing is, the players are actually the executive team. In the game, the team faces a number of life threatening challenges. Quark with his sniveling and then fear and disinclination to put any of the team at risk is the best part of the show. And it's also worth watching just for Falow's parting remark. Priceless. I like it that the series has some fluffier shows once in a while as it makes for a nice change in pace.",7
8,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Move Along Home (TV Episode 1993)",Frustrating and stupid episode,"1.09 ""Move Along Home""First contact with a gaming-obsessed species from the Gamma Quadrant takes a bad turn when Quark is caught cheating them at Dabo. They get revenge on him by forcing him to play a game of theirs in which Sisko, Kira, Dax, and Bashir are the real life pawns that are forced to confront dangerous obstacles in their attempt to ""move along home.""This is a frustrating and frankly quite stupid episode. It's memorable due to just how weird it is, but overall it's bad.THE GOOD-Sisko's approach to first contact compared to Picard or even Kirk reveals a lot about his character. Picard in particular seems to relish first contact. Sisko seems to dread it. He is definitely not a diplomat and it probably makes no sense that the Federation didn't send somebody better for the job of receiving their first official visitors from the Gamma Quadrant.-The exchange when Dax wants Sisko to leave her behind and he refuses is the best part in the episode. Their interactions are always so interesting due to their long and complicated history with each other. Sisko was Curzon's mentee, and now he is Jadzia's commanding officer, and that conflicting dynamic is fascinating.THE BAD-The whole structure of the game (or lack thereof) is frustrating. Since Quark (and by extension the audience) doesn't know the rules, everything that happens feels totally random and arbitrary.-More terrible acting from Alexander Siddig-The obstacles encountered in the game are neither clever nor interesting.-The revelation at the end that nobody was ever in danger retroactively ruins the one positive aspect of the plot, which is the tension from worrying about what will happen to the characters.-No O'Brien for the third ep in a row. Jake mentions that Keiko is still on Earth, so obviously he is with her still. Meaney is lucky he got to sit this one out.THE UGLY-Why does Sisko have a tricorder? He was sleeping in bed (in his uniform, no less), and wakes up in the game with a tricorder strapped to his hip. Utter nonsense.-Quark apparently faces no consequences for his actions.-The conversation between Brennin and Odo while scanning the alien ship provides some clues as to how the game technology works. Brennin implies that it reads like a continuous transporter beam. Most likely, the four players were locked in some sort of sustained transporter field where matter and energy is able to materialize around them and be manipulated according to the requirements of the game. The tricorders read everything in the game as real, so it's not a holosuite or virtual reality most likely, but rather some highly advanced manipulation of matter and energy, like a holosuite but where everything is fully physical rather than holographic.",4
9,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Move Along Home (TV Episode 1993)",What If,"Years ago in the British series called ""The Prisoner,"" Patrick McGoohan was thrust into a world where there were obstacles around every corner, in a kind of ""Through the Looking Glass"" motif. He never knew who is friends or enemies were or where he was heading. Here, a new alien race shows up and demand that they find ""games."" Of course, Quark runs a gambling establishment and a kind of holographic house of ill repute. He embraces them and sets off a series of events that are incredibly bizarre. That said, it serves absolutely no purpose other than to force the main characters participate in a fantastic game. Anyway, it struck me as something a writer came up with with for no other reason to play out a scenario.",6
0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Nagus (TV Episode 1993)",The Airlock Jokes begin Here,"This is the first Deep Space Nine episode where Quark threatens to toss Rom ""Out of the nearest Airlock"" - This joke was used and expanded upon for the whole seven-year run of the series.The only difference is - In this episode, it almost happened.This episode also introduces the internal government of The Ferengi and its Leader, Grand Nagus ""Zek"" played by Wallace Shawn, always accompanied by his personal servant/bodyguard(?) ""Maihar'Du"" - Who stayed in Character for seven years by never saying one line of Dialogue except in the episode ""Prophet Motive"" where one of the Prophets uses Maihar'Du's form to Speak to Quark.It was only fitting to explore this in Deep Space Nine, where we had actual Ferengi as part of the inner workings of The Station. So it was proper here for us to really begin learning how The Ferengi government operated: In this episode, much like ""The Three Stooges.""Initially, we want to attach racial/ethnic characteristics to Ferengi, but which race? What Ethnic group? Every people-group on Earth has members who act like Ferengi, sometimes they are even members of a Government body. So, rather than compare The Ferengi to any particular ETHNIC group, I want to make them into their own ""ETHIC"" group. The Ferengi have Strong ethics, which like The Klingons, they are proud of.Seen in that light, they are less of a joke, which I think was the goal of having them on Deep Space Nine. They were no longer ""Cardboard Cutouts"" or ""Comedy Relief"" — Although comedy was built around certain characters.In this episode, The Nagus stands down and gives his Title unexpectedly to Quark, and the Ferengi Leaders who have gathered at The Station immediately begin to jostle for position, either by sucking up to Quark, or trying to blow him into little bits with a Gravitic Mine.In the end, The Grand Nagus was testing his son Krax, who failed to live up to the exacting standards of greed upheld by Zek. I guess it was a permanent disowning, as we never saw Krax ever again, or heard any mentioning of his name by the Nagus in the entire run of the series.This episode almost guaranteed that we would see more of Grand Nagus Zek - And we did, he was a major part of the DS9 Universe. But it also guaranteed, that in every episode since, someone would be threatened with Airlock Ejection: Even The Cardassians used the gimmick.",10
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Nagus (TV Episode 1993)",A sudden promotion for Quark,"When the Grand Nagus arrives on Deep Space Nine Quark is concerned as a visit from the Negus usually means a loss of funds for the person being visited. It turns out the Nagus has something else in mind; he is there to name a successor. At the meeting of senior Ferengis nobody is more surprised than Quark when he is named as successor. Rather suspiciously the Negus dies soon after and new Negus Quark is almost assassinated, the problem for Quark is that nobody wants him to be Negus so the list of suspects is rather long. When he learns just who was trying to kill him he is rather surprised as the assassin is the last person he'd expected it to be.In a secondary plot Commander Sisko isn't pleased that his son Jake would rather hang around with his Ferengi friend Nog than visit Bajor with him. It seems the captain's concerns are over when Nog's father removes him from school. Jake still sees him after school though but the commander's concerns are somewhat allayed when he overhears Jake teaching Nog how to read.This wasn't a bad episode but neither was a a great one; the Ferengis are best when they have a comparatively small role; Quark is a great character but the Nagus is rather annoying, stories involving children aren't the most thrilling either.",6
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Nagus (TV Episode 1993)",A rare funny episode...,"The first season of ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" was generally a deadly serious and tremendously under-emotive. So, ""The Nagus"" clearly stands out because it is so different in style.The show begins with the Grand Nagus (Wallace Shawn) arriving on the station. This sends Quark into a dither because he assumes this Ferengi leader is out to steal his club. However, the venerable Grand Nagus actually has a more sinister plan--one that comes as a huge surprise to everyone. The first part of his plan is a total surprise, as he appoints Quark his successor! What's the second part? See the show to find out for yourself.This is a light-hearted and rather silly episode but also one that is rather enjoyable--especially since it allows Quark, his brother and nephew an opportunity for character development.",9
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Nagus (TV Episode 1993)",A fun romp...not a great episode but still a lot of fun...,"Ferengi are kind of like the oddball relatives or kooky neighbors that sometimes visit your home- they can be fun and amusing in small doses but can quickly wear out their welcome if they stay too long.That starts to happen in ""The Nagus"", an amusing episode about Quark's sudden rise (and fall) from power in Ferengi affairs. The Ferengi, with their screechy over-the-top voices, wild appearance, and annoying mannerisms, are the ""court jesters"" of the Star Trek Universe, and usually pop up (and disappear just as fast)to provide quick comic relief in the middle of a serious storyline.Here, however, we're treated to a full hour devoted almost exclusively to them, and their outrageous antics (especially the exaggerated voices) begin to grate on the nerves after a while, especially the voice of Zek, The Grand Negus, played by veteran character actor Wallace Shawn, a talented performer who specializes in portraying nerdy, whiny, over-the-top characters. I can only compare listening to his character talk to the sound of long fingernails screeching down a chalkboard (except the latter would be more tolerable).For those who journey to Star Trek looking for serious dramatic content, action, and adventure, you won't find it here- this one is played strictly for laughs from the very beginning, with nary a hostile Klingon, menacing Borg, or angry Cardassion in sight. For those that enjoy broad farce and slapstick comedy, however, you might find a chuckle or two.Fans of the talented Armin Shimermin have a real treat here, as Quark learns that ""being the boss"" is not always what it's cracked up to be. Shimermin, in the midst of outrageous comedy, manages to inject some thoughtful dramatic moments as he struggles with his new found power and the added responsibilities (and dangers) it brings.Aside from the comedy involving the Ferengi, there is a kids oriented sub-plot involving Jake & Nog, which apparently was intended to make a point about children's relationships, but, unfortunately, only serves to slow down the plot and pacing of the episode. Part of the problem lies with the child actors, who are simply too wooden and 2-dimensional in their dialog & portrayals to be of any real interest. This is often a pitfall with child actors in a drama- unless they are really good (the Harry Potter kids, for example), scenes with kids can quickly become stilted, forced, and annoying, especially if the child actors are just not skilled enough/experienced enough to carry the scene. That's what happens here and the scenes with Jake & Nog come off as flat, dull, and uninteresting, especially when interspersed with scenes featuring the outrageous & amusing Ferengi.In general, though, this is a fun and amusing episode, the highlight being a hilarious (and lovingly crafted) send-up to ""The Godfather""(1972) during the scene where Quark meets with Nava to discuss a business opportunity. This scene alone makes the whole worth watching.",5
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Nagus (TV Episode 1993)",Mildly amusing look at Ferengi business practices,"Quark is distressed to learn that he is required by the Grand Nagus Zek to host a business conference of Ferengi politicians to discuss business opportunities in the Gamma Quadrant. It seems that hosts of such conferences always lose a lot of money. But the Grand Nagus has a surprise for Quark - he says he is too old and tired to lead the business endeavors in the Gamma Quadrant and appointments Quark to be his successor as Grand Nagus. After the announcement, Zek promptly keels over and Quark immediately becomes Grand Nagus. At first Quark is aglow with the possibility of all the money he will make but soon becomes a nervous wreck as he learns that there are some Ferengi who are very displeased with his appointment and are trying to kill him. There are some laugh out loud bits that make this episode worth watching but Wallace Shawn's performance as Zek was consistently annoying. Fortunately, Shimmerman's performance as Quark is right on target and fun to watch.",6
5,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Nagus (TV Episode 1993)",Too Much Ferengi,"While I think the Ferengi are an interesting part of the Star Trek canon, too much of them wears a bit thin. Here, Quark is given tremendous power, when the Nagus passes his position on to him. Of course, now his head is on the line from his own people who thought they should get the title, including the son. It is a comic episode for the most part and Quark is his usual detestable (but cute) self. Wally Shawn plays the gnarled up old guy who is the Nagus and does it quite well. There is a sort of maudlin subplot having to do with Sisko and his son.",7
6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Nagus (TV Episode 1993)",Introducing Grand Nagus Zek,"1.10 ""The Nagus""The leader of the Ferengi, Grand Nagus Zek, shows up on DS9 and holds a conference for exploring business opportunities in the Gamma Quadrant. But at the conference he suddenly retires and names Quark his successor--much to the consternation of his son and the Ferengi merchant lords--and then shortly afterwards dies unexpectedly. Now Quark must navigate the treacherous waters of Ferengi governance while dealing with attempts on his life by those jealous of his new prestige and power.This is technically a terrarium episode, but you almost don't notice because of the sweeping galactic implications of it. Episodes like this really fulfill the core promise of DS9 as a show; no longer do we watch a crew going from place to place exploring the unknown, having adventures, and then leaving behind the mess for somebody else to clean up. Now we follow a crew that has the unknown come to them, and the consequences of those encounters are real and must be dealt with. This is more challenging to write because it's more restrictive, but restrictions breed creativity, and while the DS9 writers don't always adequately step up to the challenge, in this episode they definitely did.This is a fascinating episode because prior to this, Star Trek had always glossed over how Ferengi society works; this is the first in what would become a long line of Ferengi-centered eps on the show. The Ferengi are essentially the exact opposite of the Federation. The Federation has abandoned all market-based activities, including commerce, acquisition of assets, and even money itself; while Ferengi society is entirely based around those things.If you think about it, neither society is realistic. Both are extreme to the point where it's impossible that they could function as portrayed. The Federation's system implies several dark realities, most notably a denial of people's right to self-determination. If your society needs janitors to function and nobody wants to be a janitor, what happens? Since you can't pay people to be janitors, the only other option is coercing them into being ones. In essence, the Federation's market-less system implies that they resort to nothing less than slavery.The Ferengi, meanwhile, have no values other than the acquisition of wealth. They treat contracts with the utmost reverence, but seem to have no laws outside of strict adherence to contracts. They treat charity with disgust and view government-run social programs as the ultimate evil. Who takes care of the sick, poor, old, and/or disabled? The implication is that millions of vulnerable Ferengi must be dying in the streets every day. For that matter, according to Ferengi values, why should a parent even feed their own child? There's no profit in it. Unless they are engaging in child slave labor. Shall I go on? Needless to say, no society could function like this. It's impossible; it would be virtual anarchy and inevitably result in the collapse of their civilization.That all said, there is a deep and rich potential for storytelling when two such opposing societies (however unrealistic they may be) come into contact with each other. TNG never delivered on that potential, but DS9 does here, and will continue to do so in a big (though occasionally disappointing) ways through seven seasons.THE GOOD-Wallace Shawn is great as Zek. He was born to play a Ferengi. As I've noted before, the recurring guest stars are the best part of DS9, and episodes that feature them like this one are almost always very good.-O'brien is back! I missed him but didn't realize just how much I missed him until he walked into that classroom. The show is significantly weaker without him, as the run of three mediocre episodes in his absence proved.THE BAD-The B plot is boring and has some bad acting from Cirroc Lofton and Aron Eisenberg. But they're kid actors so that's moderately understandable and expected. A better B plot or a more fleshed-out A plot and no B plot could have pushed this to a 9 or 10 rating.THE UGLY-This episode is the first time the Rules of Acquisition are mentioned. Rules quoted count: 2 (the 1st and 6th), 2 total for the series-Rom's voice and mannerisms are much different from his first appearance and match his character for the remainder of the show's run.-Rom trying to kill Quark was shocking. I forgot he did that and it shows how much his character changed/grew over the years.-What happens to Zek's son after this?

Guest star Randy Oglesby as Ro-Kel/Ah-Kel is excellent as a ruthless smuggler (or pair of smugglers) who manages to be truly menacing without playing it too far over-the-top (quite an accomplishment in the Star Trek Universe!) Guest star Cliff De Young gives a solid performance as Croden, a roguish visitor to the Station who we initially distrust yet eventually feel compassion for. Mr. De Young's excellent acting (and a good script) make his character three-dimensional and totally believable, escaping the ""cardboard cutout"" quality of so many Star Trek characters. The character of Croden reminds us of the basic truth of people- that no one is all good or all bad, but a combination of both, and that both must be acknowledged hand-in-hand to truly know and understand a person's character.Like the best episodes in the Star Trek Universe, this one makes you think and ponder your own moral standards- and wonder what you would do were you to be in the character's situations. That is the basis for any type of excellent drama and it is presented quite well here.I give this one an 8 out of 10.",8

As Quark is having a meeting with a pair of twins who are selling an objet d'art they are interrupted by Croden, an alien from the Gamma Quadrant. In the scuffle that follows one of the twins it shot and killed then Croden is arrested by Odo who had used his shape-shifting abilities to infiltrate the meeting. Odo is somewhat disappointed that he can't hold Odo for long but has enough to deal with when the surviving twin states his intention of killing Croden. While being questioned Croden claims that he knows where there are other changelings in a vortex in the Gamma Quadrant. When Sisko goes through the worm hole to inform Croden's people that he has been arrested they demand his return for crimes he has committed back home. Sisko agrees and tasks Odo to fly him back, on the way Croden explains that his wives were killed as a punishment for his crime. The shuttle doesn't get as far as Croden's home world as the surviving twin's ship attacks them. Forced to take refuge in the vortex they land on an asteroid where he claims he can show Odo more changelings however it turns out there are none, they were just a myth on his world and Odo was the first he'd met. There is something there though; a stasis chamber which contains Croden's daughter. Soon after opening the chamber they are found and must once again flee from the twin's ship. They survive by luring their pursuer into a volatile area of the vortex... Odo must still decide what he is going to do with his two passengers though.This was a pretty good episode where we get to see Quark avoid implicating himself once again and Odo showing his sense of justice by doing the right thing even if it means ignoring his mission orders. As usual Rene Auberjonois puts in a good performance as Odo and guest star Cliff De Young does well enough as Croden.",8

However, in the process, Croden kills someone and Sisko has to decide what to do with him. However, Croden throws an interesting monkey wrench into all this---he tells Odo that he's seen OTHER changelings and he offers to tell him where...if he lets him free. Naturally, there is more to this and the denouement is quite interesting. Worth seeing, especially as Croden isn't quite as he seems and it does give some insight into Odo's origins.",7

Of course, Odo is suspicious of Croden but later discovers that he has misjudged Croden; Croden is desperate to get back to the Gamma Quadrant for honorable reasons. Sisko orders Odo to take Croden back to his home planet. Croden tells Odo that the Shapeshifters can be found on a small planet located in a volatile vortex field in the Gamma Quadrant. When Croden and Odo reach this planet, Odo finds out the truth about Croden's past and why he wanted to return to the Gamma Quadrant. All this time, the Miradorn ship is closing in on them.

While in custody, he tells Odo that he has met other shapeshifters like him in Gamma Quadrant. Odo is very eager to learn more about his people, but Crodan's government demands that he be returned to face punishment for crimes committed on their world. Now Odo is tasked to bring Crodan back, but on the way he will be faced with a conflict between his duty, sense of justice, and his desire to learn more about his people.The plot of this episode is very complex, with lots of twists and location changes. For the first time since the pilot, we get to see members of the crew going through the wormhole not once, but twice, which is exciting. As a result of the very active plot and character movement throughout, it feels like way more happens in this episode than should even be possible for 42 minutes of TV. We have scheming, murder, revenge, diplomatic contact, political intrigue, chase scenes, and most importantly of all, a lot of important exposition that will continue to be relevant through all seven seasons of the show.This episode is the first time we hear the phrase ""changelings."" Though most of what Crodan claims to know about them turns out to be lies, his story about how they used to be persecuted and that's why they don't trust humanoids is accurate. It's also curious that he knew that they don't normally retain a humanoid shape on their own planet. Overall, there's a lot of foreshadowing of future events involving the Founders and Odo's conflicting desires to be with his people but also do the right thing.THE GOOD-Great pacing and plot movement. They fit a lot of story into the ep, but it doesn't ever feel rushed.-Nice submarine hunt sequence. Definitely hearkens back to the epic sequence from Wrath of Khan, but the tactic Odo uses to take out the Miradorn ship is almost identical to the Riker Maneuver from Insurrection (and I'm not referring to the way he sits in chairs).-A lot of good character development for Odo.THE BAD-Guy who plays Crodan lacks charisma and is too lackadaisical about everything. It wasn't too hard to believe right up until the point where it's revealed that his daughter's life was on the line the whole time and then none of his attitude makes sense retroactively.-There's also no indication given of why Crodan was getting involved in Quark's schemes. We can guess that he wanted money to acquire passage back to get his daughter, but then we are forced to wonder why the heck he left his daughter in a stasis pod in some cave in the middle of a nebula. It makes no sense at all and no explanation is even attempted.THE UGLY-""Maybe that's why nobody has ever seen another shapeshifter--they're all hiding!"" Like Crodan with his tall tales, Quark is surprisingly close to the truth with this seemingly throwaway line.-The actor who plays the Miradorn twins, Randy Oglesby, has played seven different characters across four different ST shows over the years, most notably in eleven episodes on ENT season 3 as one of the Xindi leaders.-Odo shapeshift count: 1 on frame. Off frame he turns into a drinking glass, and there's a very cool shot on screen where the glass gets shattered and all the pieces turn to goo and congeal back into Odo's humanoid form. 7 total on screen shifts for the series.-The effects shots of The Nexus appear to use the exact same matte painting used to show nebulae by several different ST projects over the years, including the Mutara Nebula in The Wrath of Khan and the nebula where the Enterprise D hides from the Borg in ""The Best of Both Worlds.""-Runabouts used: Rio Grande taken by Sisko and Dax. The runabout that Odo takes is referred to by the Vulcan captain as the Ganges, but in the effects shots it is missing the Ganges' telltale dorsal sensor module. Either the sensor module is removable, or that was an error in either the script or effects department.",7

It acts as both a good charactor building story of Odo and adds some interesting background in relation to Odo's Changeling history. We're also given some hints regarding Odo's race that will feature more prominently in later episodes. The other aspects to 'Vortex' which really establish DS9 as a show which likes to draw upon 'grey areas' is the charactor of Croden, where one dismisses him at first but develops an affection towards him as the story unfolds. Previous episodes of the first season try to build on the good/bad nature of various individuals, but this is the first one which I think works exceptionally well.",8

We've seen it all before, this basic story, in TOS, ST:NG, Star Trek:Enterprise, etc.In all fairness, although the writers are clearly to blame for being repetitious, it's really hard to blame them too harshly. Star Trek has been in almost constant production since the 1960's; after hundreds of hours and story lines, it's inevitable that occasionally they are going to stumble and start repeating themselves. That's exactly what happens here.A particularly intense performance by Nana Visitor (Major Kira) and excellent character portrayals by Camille Saviola (Kai Opaka) and Paul Collins (Zlangco) help to liven things up a bit, along with a spaceship crash & some excellent hand phaser shoot-outs.Worth a look, but not a re-look.",6

They are held captive by a small warlike group and then another group attacks and they proceed to kill each other - but wait - they're not really dead and neither is Kai Opaka. In fact, their unfortunate destiny is that they cannot die but must live to fight (and die) again and again. The two warring groups have been fighting for so long that they no longer remember how the war started - or why it continues; it is now a habit they can't break. Although the theme is an often used one in the Star Trek universe, it is such an interesting theme that it bears repeating - that hatred becomes a soul killing custom and is so very difficult to overcome. And this is why the Kai is not distressed that she must stay on the planet but rather sees this as her destiny as decreed by the prophets to break or at least alleviate the results of this custom. Kai Opaka and Major Kira have a strong and enlightening scene together. Kai Opaka is an interesting character and it's a shame she exits the series so soon.

Kira remarks that it is highly unusual for The Kai to come there.After they give Opaka a short tour of the Station, she asks to be shown The Wormhole: ""The Celestial Temple"" of The Prophets. The Sisko is reluctant, he is responsible for her safety, but what harm can a short ride do? But as they leave the station, Opaka gives one of her earrings to O'Brien to give to his daughter Molly.After they get through the wormhole, they start going back, but Opaka tells them ""Prophecy must be Tested"" — and they go have a look at some planets nearby. Unfortunately, the runabout is affected by some malicious waves coming from a moon, and down they go. Opaka is apparently killed, and Kira is affected greatly.Kira, Bashir and The Sisko are caught by a group called The Nol, who are always fighting another group, the Nol-Ennis. The Nol-Ennis perform a sneak attack and kill a bunch of Nol.But to Bashir's surprise, the casualties get up, and their wounds heal themselves! And to make it worse, a dark figure walks into the cave: It is Kai Opaka, who is suddenly alive again.Sisko sends Bashir back to the runabout to get the Medical Scanner working. While that happens, he tries to get The Nol and the Nol-Ennis to make a truce, he promises to bring them all off the moon, once rescue comes, because with The Kai on the runabout, O'Brien and Dax will soon come looking for them.But the Nol and the Nol-Ennis can't be together for one minute before they start killing each other again. Bashir prevents Sisko from being killed ""For the First Time"" - Because they cannot afford to die even once! Which is usually the case anyway.These people are trapped on the moon because it is a penal colony made just for them, they cannot kill each other, at least not permanently, but if they leave the moon, the Lil computer gadgets in their bodies that make them keep getting up after being knifed, shot, blown up, etc will stop working and they'll die.But The Sisko cannot even offer them that, not because he cannot do it, but because it is not for him to do: It seems that The Prophets had told Opaka that she was to go there, die, and have to stay with the Nol and the Nol/Ennis. It's her job now...And although we never heard about The Nol or Nol Ennis ever again, we must assume that Opaka had some success in getting them to stop killing each other, because she appears to The Sisko one last time, in the episode ""Accession"" - Where she tells The Sisko, that just as The Prophets are Of Bajor, he is Of Bajor.But it still saddens me that this story arc was not looked into any further in the Series, there could have been 5 or 6 episodes dedicated to it.But at the time this episode was written and produced, we were still learning about Deep Space Nine's principal characters. Hints of Horrors in The Gamma Quadrant were being slowly dumped into the stories, but as far as the series went, it was still being treated as a continuation of The Next Generation: But starting with episodes like this one, the differences between DS9 and TNG were just beginning to become apparent.What is noticeable here, is Opaka's style of dress, compared to other characters wearing the Kai's robes: Hers reflect her inherent Spirituality, the other outfit worn by Kai Rachett/Winn, is embroidered with Gold.

They haven't been on the surface for long when they are met by a group of people called the Ennis who they learn are in a long war with another group called the Nol-Ennis. When the latter group attack several of each side are killed and afterwards the crew are shocked when the Kai walks into the cave they'd been sheltering in. It turns out nobody there dies as some sort of nanotechnology keeps everybody alive; this means the combatants are doomed to die repeatedly. Sisko suggests transporting the two sides to separate planets but the doctor's investigations indicate that the technology only works there so anybody who leaves will die; this includes Kai Opaka. She isn't perturbed by this, in fact she says she believed it was her destiny to never return to Bajor.While the basic story has been somewhat over used in all series of Star Trek is wasn't badly executed here.

However, the upside is that it clears the way for Kai Winn, who ends up being a great villain for the show.This episode is supposed to say something about how violence begets violence. It's a theme that Trek brings up pretty frequently, most notably in the Original Series episodes ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"" and the great ""Day of the Dove""--the latter in particular doing a better job of addressing the issue than ""Battle Lines"" does. But frankly it's a safe topic to address and not one I find very compelling. ""Hatred is bad, mmkay."" That said, this episode is still decent, mostly due to the performances of the guest stars.THE GOOD-Going through the wormhole is always a positive, especially in this rather claustrophobic first season. More cowbell, please.-Camille Saviola is really good as Opaka. It's a major shame she was never brought back for any substantial roles.-Jonathan Banks' imdb page would probably be taller than me if it was printed out. He's a highly sought after character actor for good reason and it's awesome to see him here as the alien leader.-The action sequences are actually decent, though not amazing. Since they were directed by the stunt director and not the incompetent Paul Lynch, that would explain the step up in quality from previous eps. I'm glad that Lynch doesn't direct any more eps after this one because he isn't good.THE BAD-Nana Visitor's acting is physically painful to watch. She's so bad.-The ending is rather unsatisfying and depressing. Opaka says they are ready to begin the healing, but no indication of that is given. It seems like maybe she was putting on a brave face so the crew wouldn't feel bad about leaving her behind, damned to an eternal hell of suffering, violence, and death.THE UGLY-Terrible response time from Sisko and Kira when the satellite system aggresses them. They should have warped out immediately, especially considering their passenger. O'Brien is much quicker on his feet and bugs out the instant the satellites start scanning.-Runabout roster: Ganges and Rio Grande. Say goodbye to the Yangtzee Kiang, as it's destroyed in the crash landing.-Sisko gets defensive when Bashir questions his decision to try and save the prisoners, but I think Sisko's justification for why it's not a violation of the Prime Directive, at least in spirit, is sound. The decaying nature of the defensive satellite system indicates that whoever placed the prisoners there is no longer around, so freeing them isn't a violation of that society's natural course of evolution.-Dax and O'Brien fly the Rio Grande while searching for the missing Yangtzee, but the Ganges seems better suited for a search and rescue mission with its advanced sensors. We can only assume a different crew is also flying the Ganges in a different part of the sector, also looking for Sisko.",7

The list goes on and on and on.The ST creators love episodes about villagers because villagers are economical- wardrobe is kept to a bare minimum (robes and simple tunics and such), make-up is limited, and no fancy gadgets or sets are required (villagers are, after all, primitive and ""one-with-nature""- which means you don't have to spend a lot on set construction).Star Trek villagers as a plot device, however, have 2 main drawbacks: 1. They can quickly become dull and boring if we spend too much time on them, unless the actors and story are so powerful that they can overcome this (as in ST:NG's excellent episode, ""The Inner Light"", for example); 2. Group scenes with villagers tend to look cheesy, cliché', and staged if not planned creatively. Rather than evoking the image of a mysterious new alien species, they more often end up looking like a group of overacting Southern Californian bit part TV actors who would be more at home in a cereal commercial than on the exotic confines of a Star Trek Planet.This is the formidable slippery slope that dominates ""The Storyteller"", a feel good, ""group hug"", first season installment that plays more like a group therapy session than an exciting Star Trek adventure. Some laughingly poor special effects for the hostile energy cloud (""Star Trek V: The Final Frontier"" anyone?) and a rather funny near-encounter between Miles O'Brian and three seriously hot & sexy village women can't salvage this one from being what it is...an excellent cure for insomnia.As if the show's primary focus on the somnolent villagers wasn't enough to hasten you to your slumbers, the creators add a ""coup de grace"" subplot back on the station featuring a precocious teenage ambassador and her two smitten suiters (the notorious ""plot slowing"" Jake and Nog). A couple minutes enduring their stilted dialog, poor acting, and hilarious hijinks (Hey-did you see that? Nog threw oatmeal on Jake!- har, har, har!) and you'll be BEGGING for the return of Wesley Crusher- and wondering if you're watching the right show (is this ""Star Trek"" or ""Saved by the Bell""?)

Unfortunately neither story was really that strong. The main story, from which the episode gets its name, involves Chief O'Brien and Dr Bashir who have gone down to Bajor when they learn a village is facing a medical emergency. When they get there they are surprised to learn the emergency is just one old man approaching death. It turns out he is ""The Sirar"" the village story teller who must protect the village from a strange creature which attacks on five nights each year. The chief is taken aback when the dying Sirar names him as his successor, when the chief assists with the vanquishing of the creature the villages all except him as the new Sirar, all that is apart from the old Sirar's apprentice. He explains how the creature is actually created by the villages own fears using a splinter of an orb. The next night the villages will learn if O'Brien has what it takes to save them or if somebody else really deserves the job. Back on DS9 two groups of Bajorans have arrived to try to settle a land dispute. One of the two parties is led by a teenage girl who catches the eye of Jake and Nog. While trying to charm her Nog says something which could help her settle the dispute.This episode felt weaker than most, the village was of the type we've seen many times in most versions of Star Trek and the story of Nog and Jake trying to charm the young Bajoran was just cheesy although Gina Philips was charming in the role of Varis. One good thing about the episode was how it has started to show O'Brien and Julian's friendship beginning.",6
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Storyteller (TV Episode 1993)",So-so episode,"I knew this was not going to be one of my favorite episodes when I found the side plot of Jake and the obnoxious Nog's adolescent antics as entertaining as the main plot of O'Brien - against his will- being named Sirah the Storyteller of a small village on Bajor.

The Paqu, along with the rival tribe, the Navot have come to DS9 to present their respective land claims to Sisko for his arbitration.

They discover that the Sirah must perform a nightly ritual to protect the village from a mystical creature called the Dal'Rok. However, when he dies, he names O'Brien as his successor, much to the engineer's dismay. Now he and Bashir have to find a way to save the village when the Dal'Rok returns. Meanwhile on the station, Sisko is mediating a border dispute between two hostile Bajoran factions, with the leader of one of the factions being a young girl who is eager to prove that she is a strong leader--even if it means pushing their factions into an avoidable war.The two plots of this episode are unrelated, despite both being about Bajoran society, and are ultimately inconsequential. The main reason to watch this episode is that it is jam packed with character development. We get tons of great O'Brien moments, and we see even more clearly than ever how much he dislikes Bashir. Considering that they go on to become inseparable friends, it's fun to watch O'Brien struggle (and fail) to contain his annoyance at every single thing Bashir says.The real character development here, though, is for a different pair of inseparable friends, Jake and Nog. Unlike the last B plot they were involved in (in ""The Nagus""), this time both young actors actually do a decent job and their story is fun and interesting. If not for the strength O'Brien as a character, I would argue that the B plot outshines the A plot in this particular episode. We get to see a lot of how Jake and Nog are developing as characters and people, which will be relevant for the entire show's run.THE GOOD-Good character development for Jake and Nog.-Important piece in the O'Brien-Bashir friendship arc-I love how O'Brien always says ""Julian"" with venom in his voice throughout the whole ep. It makes Bashir so uncomfortable that he reverses his request for O'Brien to call him that. The smirk from O'Brien when his little mind game works is amazing.-O'Brien's distraught reactions to all the Sirah-related situations he finds himself in are so much fun to watch. I laughed quite a bit more in this ep than I expected to, mostly due to those moments. His trollish cackle when he realizes he's off the hook for being the Sirah is probably my favorite part of the ep.-Going off the above, Bashir's amusement at O'Brien's discomfort is also fun to watch. Even though they aren't friends yet, you can definitely see the seeds of it here. And their friendship becomes one of the best parts of DS9, so it's fun to watch its genesis.THE BAD-Bajoran ep. Why are their outfits always so ugly?-Inconsequential plot-The girl who plays the Bajoran tetrarch isn't a very good actressTHE UGLY-Rules of Acquisition quoted: 1 (9th). 3 total for the series.-The runabout used by O'Brien and Bashir must be the Rio Grande, since the Yangtzee Kiang is gone and it lacks the Ganges' sensor module.-It takes the runabout 2 hours to get from DS9 to Bajor. If they were travelling at warp 1 (the speed of light), that would mean that Bajor is about 14 AU (2.2 billion km) away from the station. But since the station was in orbit around Bajor before being moved on thrusters to the wormhole, it seems much more likely that they are significantly closer together and the journey between is done at impulse speeds.-The Bajoran tetrarch is consistently referred to as being the same age as Jake and Nog (and the script apparently specifies her as being 15), but the actress who plays her, Gina Phillips, was 23 at the time. Jake is 14 and Nog is around 16, although Aron Eisenberg is actually a few months older than Phillips in real life.-The use of the title ""tetrarch"" is very interesting. The historical context of that title in Earth history is pretty complex, but the meaning of the word itself implies that she is one of four joint rulers (tetra- being the Greek prefix meaning 'four'--a tetrarchy is a 'leadership of four {people}'). If so, it makes no sense that the other three rulers would send a young girl to negotiate instead of one of them going. Perhaps the rest of tetrarchy was destroyed during the occupation and they keep the title as a matter of tradition?",7
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Storyteller (TV Episode 1993)",Read karacter's review--they nailed this episode right on the head.,"O'Brien and Dr. Bashir are sent on a mission to assist the Sirah, a spiritual leader who controls a monster, the Dal'Rok, by sending it away as it approaches the town each year. Oddly, however, the Sirah is thrilled to see O'Brien and indicates HE is his successor...and the Sirah then dies. But O'Brien has no idea how the old man controlled the weird creation and soon he's shocked at the instant devotion the villagers have towards him.The other plot involves some negotiations between two Bajoran tribes. It seems that their boundary was a river--and the Cardassians re- routed it. So where is this new border? Well, as for one group, their leader is an obnoxious and extremely immature young woman who seems to delight in arguing during these important negotiations--and Sisko is baffled how to deal with her. At the same time, Nog and Jake are infatuated with her and spend time lusting after her and eventually befriending her.Both plots seem very inconsequential and rather dull--particularly the one about boundaries. Relying so much on the boys make this one particularly unimpressive and insignificant. And, as often is the case in this show, the Bajorans are an incredibly annoying race, as they are almost constantly fighting and arguing. It also didn't help that the 'monster' in the other plot was created by a special effects person who dumped cream into another liquid and played it back very slowly. All in all, there are quite a few things about this one that make it sub- par and a bit silly.",4

Farmer Mullibok is a strong, stubborn, somewhat curmudgeonly old man who is also wise, and oddly endearing. Major Kira comes not only respect him but like him and thus becomes torn as to what it is her duty to do and what is the right thing to do. She and Sisko have a fascinating, albeit brief discussion about this issue. This is a very good character development episode for Kira but it is Brian Keith as Mullibok who steals the show. It is a magnificent performance; what a fine actor Keith was. We come to care about Mullibok but as so often happens, there is no happy ending.

1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Progress (TV Episode 1993)",Slow paced but moving story about senior citizens...,"You won't find any ""fall out of your seat"" space adventure here, and the story itself isn't particularly original and doesn't break any new ground.Two elements, however, raise this installment above average- first, the excellent casting of veteran actor Brian Keith as the defiant and spirited farmer, Mullibok, and an outstanding and emotional outing for Nana Visitor (Major Kira)as she is torn between her devotion to duty and her growing affection, empathy, and respect for the father like Mullibok.Brian Keith was one of Hollywood's finest and most productive character actors, with a career that stretched all the way back to silent films. An expert at portraying ""gruff and irascible but soft on the inside"" characters, he is perfectly cast here, and delivers a powerful, moving, and multi-layered performance. The fact that Keith is so well known to viewers adds to the impact of the show, as his familiar face, voice, and personality reinforces the idea that this could be your grandpa or your uncle being forced to make major life changes in his twilight years.Also adding to the emotional power and effectiveness of Brian Keith's performance is the fact that his role as Mullibok closely mirrored his own private life at the time; indeed, his later years were shadowed by personal tragedy, unwanted change, and health issues (just like his character in the show). Interestingly enough, this fine and respected actor ended up taking his own life just 4 years after appearing in this episode, in a classic case of art imitating life. Proud & dignified to the end (just like his character Mullibok), he chose to end his own life on his own terms in 1997 rather than submit to a long and debilitating terminal illness and the lifestyle changes that it was sure to bring.Also in this episode, Nana Visitor (Major Kira)turns in an outstanding performance, and we get a good look past her cold, defiant exterior to see how lonely & desperate she is on the inside. Her scenes with Mullibok, especially when she stays to take care of him after he is injured, are among the most moving & emotional ever seen in the Star Trek Universe.A silly and pointless ""Jake & Nog"" sub-plot focusing on their efforts to be businessmen is mildly amusing, but seems out of place here; mixing it in with the much more substantial and meaningful Major Kira/Mullibok storyline only serves to disrupt the emotional pacing of the show. In addition, their sub-plot has a ""Brady Bunch"" feel to it, and is just way too campy to have any real meaning. Star Trek is watched by a lot of kids, true, but it is not a kid's show, and efforts to make it such only detract from the whole.Not the greatest Deep Space Nine installment, but well worth watching to see a great Hollywood legend in one of his final screen appearances.",6

Even so he refuses to leave and Kira insists on staying with him.Meanwhile back on DS9 Quark is not pleased when his brother takes delivery of a large quantity of food which nobody except Cardassians like and not many Cardassians visit the station these days. Nog however sees it as a chance to make a profit, nobody on DS9 might want it but a ship heading to Cardassia might have something to trade for it and if that item has no obvious use they can always trade it to somebody who wants that.While this episode wasn't packed with action it provided some good character development for Major Kira and the Jake/Rom subplot was better than most involving the station's two most commonly featured children.

4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Progress (TV Episode 1993)",Classic Moral Dilemma Trek,"1.14 ""Progress""The Bajoran government is planning to tap the molten core of one of its moons and transfer the energy to the planet to heat homes for the winter, but a stubborn old settler on the moon named Mullibok refuses to vacate. Kira tries and fails to convince him to leave, forcing her to choose between her duty and doing what is right.This is classic moral dilemma Trek episode. A lot of time is spent (basically the entire episode) building a bond between Kira and Mullibok and much is made of her emotional turmoil, but essentially she is forced to choose between her duty and doing the right thing. It doesn't matter how many people the tap will help, the government has no right to forcefully relocate somebody who doesn't want to leave their home and their property. It's essentially the same thing as ethnic cleansing, even if ethnicity isn't involved. And even if it's just one person, it's still evil. As Picard asks in his legendary mini speech from Insurrection, ""HOW MANY PEOPLE DOES IT TAKE, ADMIRAL?""However, unlike Picard, Kira makes the utilitarian choice in the end. This could be an indication of DS9's more morally gray tone compared to TNG, but I think it has more to do with the way sci fi writers insist on writing women. I think they are afraid that if Kira made the right choice and refused to allow Mullibok to be forcefully relocated, that it would be seen as her being controlled by her emotions. In order to avoid being accused of sexism, the writers have her make the choice that is seen as being more rational, even though it is wrong. The same thing consistently happens on Voyager, where Janeway almost always makes the utilitarian choice rather than the one that protects individuals' rights and dignity. I believe this is due to the politically correct forces in Hollywood and it's extremely disappointing because it does a great disservice to the women on these shows. It's truly ironic that political correctness has the consequence of writers not being allowed to write good, complex female characters.Then again, an argument can be made that the utilitarian choice is the only correct one according to Federation ethics. The Federation is essentially a socialist utopia (at least as presented by Roddenberry--DS9 ironically does a ton to subvert that notion). Socialism is a system of government for which trampling on the rights of individuals for the ""common good"" is a core tenant, so maybe all the times that Picard chooses to protect the rights of individuals over the collective utilitarian good is actually ""wrong"" by Federation ethical standards and Janeway is actually correct. That still doesn't explain Kira's choice in this ep, though, since she isn't part of the Federation. Not only is her choice wrong, but it is completely out of character for her and that is why I believe her actions were written the way they were in order to avoid accusations of sexism, rather than in service of the character and the story.THE GOOD-Mullibok is an interesting and charismatic character. He's equal parts frustrating and endearing. I think he is selfish and his decision not to leave is completely dictated by his fear of...basically everything. He is ruled by his fear. But I also respect him standing his ground against the government and feel bad for him with the way the ep ends.-The moral dilemma is thought-provoking (obviously, considering I just wrote a mini essay on it...).THE BAD-Kira-centric ep. She's actually not terrible here, but she's also not great.-The plot moves very slowly. It's a character-focused story and Brian Keith as Mullibok more than carries his weight, but Visitor lacks the charisma or acting chops to make such a slow story hold your interest completely.-The B plot with the kids is not interesting. Also this is the third time in four eps that Jake and Nog have been featured in the B plot. It's getting pretty old. Give Dax something to do for once instead, please.-Kira's choice at the end is very disappointing.THE UGLY-Runabout used: Ganges. No sensor module again, so it must really be removable.-The kids not being able to figure out what a self-sealing stem bolt is is silly. I guess DS9 doesn't have the internet?-It's fascinating that Bajor has a moon capable of supporting a breathable atmosphere. For a class M planet to have a moon massive enough to also hold that kind of an atmosphere, the moon would have to be pretty close to the same size as the planet. In fact, the planet and the moon would most likely be orbiting each other, much like Pluto and its moon Charon do. Pluto and Charon are tidally locked, so it's possible Bajor and Jerrado are as well, which would eliminate the possibility of destructive tidal forces that would otherwise be a consequence of such a massive moon, and also make an energy tap much easier, since the same point on Bajor is always aligned with the same point on Jerrado.",6

The first is supposed to be humorous and involves Nog and Jake taking some Cardassian Yamok sauce (which Quark didn't want or need) and trading for successive products--all in the hope that eventually it will exchanged for latinum. The second involves Major Kira going to one of Bajor's moons to relocate 50 settlers because the moon is going to be converted for energy production--which will make the place uninhabitable. Unfortunately, an old crank named Mullibok (Brian Keith) and his two mute friends would rather die than leave the place. There is a certain irony about having Brian Keith play a man who is suicidal, as a few years after starring in this show he actually did commit suicide in real life. While I generally don't like episodes that star Nog and Jake (or any kids), this plot turns out pretty well and is played for laughs. As for the other plot, it is decent enough. Overall, a rather inconsequential but enjoyable episode.",7

It's obvious that the actors had a great time filming this episode, and their enthusiasm is contagious.The key to this episodes success, as with most great theater, is immediate & consistent connection with the characters- identifying through personal experience what they are going through makes the viewer feel like ""a part of the action"".

It appears to contain a computer program which Chief O'Brien transfers to DS9.

As he tries to figure out what is wrong Chief O'Brien comes to believe that the computer is creating problems just to get his attention. This sounds far fetched but it is possible that the program they downloaded from the probe may be an life form which just wants some attention.While the main story about the computerised life form was fairly average the side story where Odo was stuck in a turbolift with Lwaxana was rather touching as she was able to reassure him as he had to turn into his liquid form, a private thing he'd never let anybody see before.",7

Meanwhile, some Federation ambassadors are on board and Sisko passes the buck of dealing with them to Dr. Bashir, but one of the ambassadors is Lwaxana Troi and she has taken a special interest in Odo.This is a pretty pointless and boring episode for the most part. Lwaxana's presence in eps seems to go one of two ways: either it leads to a lot of humorous situations or it leads to total and complete boredom. This episode is mostly the latter.The energy that Majel Barrett brings to the screen is impressive, to be sure, but unless Lwaxana is stirring up trouble, she doesn't lend herself to many interesting stories. It doesn't help that this particular story has been done with her many times before. Shamelessly throwing herself at every man that she encounters (none of whom want to be with her) was a trope that got old quickly on TNG and this ep does nothing to remedy that. On the plus side, we get some good character development for her and especially Odo in their scenes trapped on the turbolift, and Odo is such a deep and complex character that any development for him is always good. Overall this is a slightly below-average episode.THE GOOD-Lots of O'Brien, who is great as always.-Sisko is great too in this ep. I love the way he interacts with absolutely everyone. From trying to soothe O'Brien's ego, to bracing himself before dealing with the ambassadors, to his glee at torturing Bashir with the assignment--he is such a good character. Avery Brooks can be very awkward at times, especially with his dialogue delivery, but he often makes up for it with the nonverbal things he does as an actor to make his character come alive. Plus he is so well written. He's not hammy like Kirk, nor is he perfect like Picard; he's the most ""real"" of the captains by far and that's why I think he's equal with those two legendary captains on my ranking scale.-Good character development for Odo, although it's mostly just talking which isn't super interesting. Still we get a lot of meaty backstory for him that will be explored deeper in future eps.-Lwaxana Troi reminds me of Michael Scott from The Office. She's awkward and cringy and often downright unlikable, but she usually does something by the end of the ep to redeem herself or make you feel for her in some small way, just like you usually do with Michael. I think that the last act of this ep does a lot to show her to be more complex, caring, and compassionate than the buffoon she is often portrayed as.THE BAD-Terrarium ep-The B plot (or is it a C plot?) with the other ambassadors feels utterly and completely pointless. The ambassadors themselves are all so wooden, one-dimensional, and boring. Every scene with them was a chore to get through.-Yet another ep where Lwaxana throws herself at a man. It's boring and cringy and simply not fun to watch at this point.THE UGLY-What is up with the episode's title? Who or what is supposed to be forsaken?-So, apparently this didn't happen because I can find no confirmation of it on Memory Alpha, but I have a distinct memory of the crew unleashing the Pup during the Dominion War when the station was occupied by the Dominion, in order to mess with their control of it. Maybe it happened in a Dominion War novel I read years ago, but there's nothing on Memory Beta about that either. Apparently in a novel called Valhalla they do that to a different force that has taken over the station, but I'm like 95% sure I've never read that novel so I have no idea where my memory of that happening comes from.

Odo is the only senior staff member not affected and he has to try and figure out what happened and fix it before the brewing power struggle tears the station apart.Episodes where the crew play different characters from themselves are usually pretty enjoyable and this one is no exception. The scheming and plotting is sufficiently entertaining and holds your interest well. Overall a good episode, if rather inconsequential.THE GOOD-Odo shows a remarkable talent for subterfuge. He navigates the paranoia and plotting with the grace and subtlety of a super spy, playing off each person's strengths and weaknesses masterfully in order to accomplish his goal of curing them all without them learning his motivations. It foreshadows the espionage capabilities we see from his species later on.-The tension and drama is excellent in this ep. The pacing of the plot is also good. All around a very well-written episode.THE BAD-Avery Brooks' acting is super weird in this ep. I'm guessing his character was supposed to be mentally unstable, but he comes off as being really goofy.-Inconsequential terrarium ep.THE UGLY-I couldn't stop thinking throughout how perfect Garak would have been in this ep. He would be right in his element and seeing him and Odo work together to save the day would have been a lot of fun too.-The random Bajoran who tries to assasinate Sisko was one of several who were in ops when they beamed aboard the Klingon, so presumably he was also infected and that's why he took part in the scheming.-Odo shapeshift count: 1...sort of. His face does a weird clapping motion when it rejects the telepathic matrix. I'm going to count it because they used the orange goo effect of him shapeshifting. 9 total for the series.-Hulk Kira count: 1. She picks up Quark and throws him across the bar. Even though Quark is small, no way a petite woman like her would have the upper body strength to do that. 2 total hulk outs for the series so far.",7
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Dramatis Personae (TV Episode 1993)",I prefer this version of the crew...,"One of the best of the original ""Star Trek"" episodes was ""Mirror, Mirror"". It was a wonderful change of pace to have a different sort of ship in this alternate universe--one that wasn't nearly so noble and which was based not on loyalty and honor but on greed and scheming! Here with ""Dramatis Personae"" the same sort of dynamic is occurring on Deep Space 9. After the Klingons find some strange energy spheres, the crew begin behaving weirdly. Suddenly they became paranoid and were embroiled in a power struggle--one that resulted in the Klingons killing each other. Now, after coming into contact with one of the Klingons, the humanoids, not including Odo, all become just like the Klingons and they now have alliances led by Kira as well as Sisko and it appears that soon they'll become embroiled in their own mutiny. Can the ship survive and can Odo get everything back to normal?Considering how loyal and boring the crew usually acted on Deep Space 9, it was a great breath of fresh air seeing them all behave like evil jerks! All in all, a nice change of pace and a surprisingly fun episode.",9

Sisko and O'Brien become allies against a mutiny put in motion by Kira and the Bajorans. Things get ugly as others on the ship begin to ally themselves with either faction. Kira is particularly ruthless in her activities. Since Odo doesn't seem to be affected, he gets wind of the strangeness and must figure a solution.

As the two engage in a ""war of words,"" the show, like good science fiction, has strong commentary on the intricacies of war and the roles that are played by both sides of the antagonistic ""coin."" Visitor is fantastic as her character struggles with her determination to see justice but must toy with doubts about the man's guilt.

1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Duet (TV Episode 1993)",DS9 manages to take the viewer to remarkable places without moving an inch.,"I have long had mixed feelings about Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. On the one hand, it has such fine pedigree, I can't help but be intrigued. On the other, the idea of a ""trekking the stars"" while aboard a stationary space port seemed a contradiction in terms, and a recipe for boredom.And yet, a surprisingly high percentage of Trek devotees hold up DS9 as the very pinnacle of the Trek series and the Trek ""mission"". They will tell you it is the most cerebral, the most philosophical, the most challenging. And, more often than not, they are right. Unlike TOS, TNG, VOY and ENT, DS9 (particularly in its first few seasons) rarely relies on hostile aliens, pyrotechnic space battles and mysterious spatial anomalies threatening its crew to hold the attention of its audience. Warp is NOT a factor on DS9, as it is a series dedicated not to the exploration of the far reaches of space, but to the exploration of the even more inscrutable mysteries of the mind.""Duet"" is the best of the first season, and, arguably, the best episode of the entire series. (Some here have even suggested it may be the best episode of ALL the Trek iterations.) Using clever plot twists, seemingly contradictory clues, and brilliant dialog culminating with a revelation that hits the viewer square in the gut, leaving you quite literally breathless. It is a beautifully written, performed, composed and produced episode.Others here have revealed enough about the basic plot that I need not restate it; instead, I post this review just to add to the consensus, and let all those considering watching this episode (and this series), that this is amazing television, and far-reaching ""exploration"" -- even though the space explored is no bigger than that between your ears!",9
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Duet (TV Episode 1993)",This is arguably the best episode of any Star Trek series ever.,"It is difficult to discuss the meaning of this episode of DS9 without revealing important plot twists. However, I can say, as an avid fan of all the Star Trek series, this episode stuck with me more than any other.The Cardassian occupation of Bajor was in many ways comparable to the Nazi extermination of the Jews. When it appears a Cardassian war criminal, who was responsible for countless murders of innocent Bajorans, might have been discovered on DS9, it looks, at first, like this episode will be some melodrama about the powerful victimizing the weak, or perhaps the evils of militaristic societies.But this episode holds some surprises. I'll refrain from giving any more details about this episode other than to say this was one of the rare times that any TV show has inspired such an emotional response in me.It is a shame that science fiction on television is not held in higher regard because this episode was worthy of an Emmy Award.",10
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Duet (TV Episode 1993)",Transcendent television,"The Star Trek franchise has often been thought of as television light. At times that's been a fair criticism, with exceptions such as TNG's ""The Inner Light"" and ""City on the Edge of Forever"" from the original. With ""Duet,"" Deep Space Nine makes its case to be taken seriously.I feel no compulsion to run down the plot points of ""Duet,"" DS9's second to last first season episode. ""Duet"" transcends Star Trek, or science fiction, for that matter. It is simply one of the finest hours of television you'll likely ever see. Harris Yulin's stunning performance is Emmy-worthy. And Nana Visitor holds her own in her self-described favorite episode.Rarely do you find such a sublime example of writing, acting and theme on the small screen. ""Duet"" is TV as high art, something that's become far too rare.",10

It is an episode that takes you down one direction, then swings you 180 degrees, and ends by making you rethink all you know about guilt and redemption. It truly was the best of the best.A life changing episode for a thinking audience.",10

The cast's performances, especially Nana Visitor's, are excellent. Harris Yulin puts in one his amazing career's best performances as Aamin Marritza, a Cardassian who is disgusted at the war crimes his people committed on Bajor during the Occupation. To make his people admit their guilt, he disguises himself as the most bloodthirsty and cruel Cardassian on Bajor during the Occupation.This is episode is the favorite of Nana Visitor and author Terry Erdmann among many others.",10
6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Duet (TV Episode 1993)",A great episode,"I thought this episode would turn out to be of the type where somebody turning up at the station claiming to be a total innocent would be exposed as a war criminal and most of the way through it looked as if I was right. While that wouldn't necessarily have been bad it would be a little cliché, thankfully the ending was both surprising and touching.When Aamin Marritza, a Cardassian, arrives at the station asking for medicine for a disease which has only one known source; an accident at a forced labour camp on occupied Bajor. Major Kira wants him to be sent to Bajor so he can be tried for war crimes. At first he claims he wasn't there but later admits that he was but only as a lowly file clerk. When the Bajorans send the only known photograph of Aamin Marritza it doesn't match the man they have in custody, he is in the picture though, only he is not the lowly file clerk but notorious camp commandant Gul Darhe'el. When confronted with this new evidence the prisoner changes his story to such an extent that he positively revels in the atrocities... there is just one problem; Gul Darhe'el was away from the camp at the time of the accident so couldn't possibly have the disease the prisoner clearly does. Ultimately we learn that he was in fact that lowly file clerk, a man who was so disgusted by what happened at the camp that he was willing to stand trial so justice could be seen to be done even though the true war criminal was long dead.This episode featured great performances from Nana Visitor as Major Kira and guest star Harris Yulin as the Cardassian prisoner.",10
7,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Duet (TV Episode 1993)",Exemplary. (Some Spoilers vary by interpretation),"This episode was, simply put, one of the most outstanding examples of paradigm shifts in Star Trek history. At points you are compelled to loathe the entire Cardassian species. You are brought into the minds of the worst aspects of their species (Played magnificently by Harris Yulin) only to be ripped, swiftly, from that aspect into an example of what can only be called the survivor's guilt of a broken soul. In addition to that element you have the war inside Kira Nerys' mind (Played by Nana Visitor) as she attempts to cope with the byproduct of what was a horrific genocide for her people. This is one of those select moments in Television where a show becomes somewhat difficult to observe for all the right reasons. It is supposed to hurt you, if it didn't you're barely human to begin with. It deals with prejudice, spite, xenophobic malevolence, regret, sorrow, horror, atrocity, aggression, ignorance, guilt, and the willingness for a man who sat by doing nothing to make one last sacrifice in the name of those he witnessed being brutalized in front of him. This is probably my favorite Star Trek episode from any series with The Inner Light and I Borg being near seconds, and I enjoy every series whether or not the episode is meant to be serious or humorous in temperament. This is probably one of my top five favorite Science Fiction TV show episodes ever.",9
8,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Duet (TV Episode 1993)",Damn good episode,"This was a damn good episode. Harris Yulin was superb as Guldar Heel (nice name for a villain too - get it, ""HEEL"" ) I loved the line ""I'm your nemesis, I'm GulDar Heel""! He actually played two different character, Amin Marittza as Guldar Heel, then Amin Marittza as himself. Both were totally believable, and I love the wrap-around ending. The character at the beginning of the movie that was released from jail was told to ""stay out of trouble"", and he doesn't. The Cardassian that was seen as an enemy by Major Kira, is, considered , by implication, an ally. It was a hearkening back to the original star trek,where social commentary was disguised as Sci-Fi. Best episode on of that series ever!",10

10,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Duet (TV Episode 1993)",Cardassian History X,"While I think calling this episode the best of all Star Trek, or even just of DS9, is very exaggerated, it is a fine example of good science fiction. The parallels that can be drawn between the plot and history are perhaps a little too obvious, but this is the point: to make you think about something by talking about something else.There are three elements that make the episode work so well. First, Harris Yulin puts on an excellent guest performance as Aamin Marritza / Gul Darhe'el, being charming and maniacal at equal measures. Secondly, the twists, although more than a few, are believable - there is a logic in the layers of deception, it isn't an effort to fool the audience. And lastly, the ending is fitting not only dramatically, but also as a final lesson.",9
11,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Duet (TV Episode 1993)",A Waltz for Major Kira,"I must say in response to something that greatly offends me: Deep Space Nine was in NO WAY a ""Mediocre Trek"" - DS9 rose above all of the standards for Science Fiction Television shows of the Networks, of the Trek Franchise and no other show has come close to the Quality of Imagery, of Writing, and of Acting in this one Trek show that stands all by itself outside of the Franchise.This episode is Bookended to S6E11 ""Waltz"" and has a much similar structure. That episode had The Sisko having his personal confrontation with Gul Dukat, who had gone mad, and had been given every opportunity to make up for a past filled with Murder and Destruction.In this episode, a man named Amin Marritza, who has ""Kallo-Nohra Syndrome"" is brought to the Station by a Kobheerian Freighter Captain, played by Normal Large: Who was Romulan Proconsul Neral in ST:TNG.As Kallo-Nohra Syndrome was contracted by Bajoran Prisoners from only one place: The Gallitepp Forced-Labour Camp, Kira is excited to meet one of her personal heroes. But when she gets to Sick Bay, she is confronted with Amin Marritza (Harris Yulin), who is a Cardassian.The only other people to contract this disease other than the Bajora, were their Cardassian Overseers and Torturers, and so Kira immediately has Marritza arrested by Odo.If it were up to The Sisko, he'd have Marritza released immediately, but Kira makes such a stink about this guy, she thinks he is actually Gul Darhe'el, a Cardassian War Criminal who the Bajora had never gotten the opportunity to arrest.In a way, this mirrors the prosecution of Nazi War Criminals post WWII, maybe some of them deserved Prosecution, and maybe some of them were like Marritza: They were forced to do their jobs even though they hated what they were doing.If Nerys is correct, this guy is Darhe'el, and he deserves to be put to death. But The Sisko has Odo and Dr Bashir do further investigation. While waiting for results, Major Kira has several conversations with Marritza: Who at first refuses to admit he is Gul Darhe'el. But as he is pressed, and it becomes apparent that this guy *is* hiding something, he breaks down and Admits to Nerys that he really is Darhe'el and actually enjoyed murdering and torturing Bajorans.Someone mentions ""Man in the Glass Both"" and I agree that this episode is an Homage to that play. But here, we have some of the best Dialogue of The Series, in Kira's Discussions with the great Harris Yulin.In ""Ghostbusters II"" Yulin gets to go off on one of his little Orations: This was how I recognized the actor in this episode as 'The Judge who wanted to burn Ghostbusters at the stake!"" Here, he is describing the Horrors he inflicted on The Bajorans at Gallitepp, with the exact same relish as that character.That Dialog alone makes this one of the greatest Television Episodes, of any series, ever. I could have lived if this guy really was this ""Butcher of Gallitepp"" - But as it was found out, Marritza was exactly who he said he was at the beginning of the episode: A Clerk and Accountant, who used to cover his ears when the Screams of the Bajorans came at night. This is another part of the conversation which is Mirrored in ""Waltz"" - When Dukat's internal ""Weyoun"" tells Dukat how much he really enjoyed those same screams.In this episode, we have a meek man, pretending to be a Butcher, in ""Waltz"" we have a Butcher who is trying to convince The Sisko, he is NOT a Butcher.Great Writing and Great Continuity between a Season 1 and Season 6 episode, and by the time Season Six rolled around, Marc Alaimo (Dukat) was able to pull off what Yulin pulls off with ease in this episode.",10
12,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Duet (TV Episode 1993)",The Best Episode of Star Trek.,"This is, in my personal opinion, the most powerful episode of Star Trek ever brought to fruition. The central issue is the guilt of the coward: something that we all fear, despise, and yet sympathize with. We pray that when morality is discarded we will have the bravery to stand against inhuman cruelty, and yet we know we can't; a society in motion pays no heed to the ethics of the individual. This episode beautifully portrays the emotional evisceration of a Cardassian who was too afraid to stand and sacrificed himself after the war to bring justice to those who suffered as a result of his indecision. Nana Visitor, herself one of the most talented actors (or actresses) in ST history conveys the evolution of a person consumed by hatred for the enemy to despair for those who could not protest true evil with masterful skill. Star Trek has served as grounds for calling into question many of Western society's most pressing ethical questions; let each viewer of ""Duet"" be reminded of the burning and eternal torment of the coward, a guilt that can be understood but cannot be forgotten or forgiven. Harris Yulin and Nana Visitor should be congratulated as having been the vessels of the most powerful emotional journey in all of Star Trek's history.",10
13,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Duet (TV Episode 1993)",A gem of an episode for a mediocre series.,"As Deep Space Nine was my least favorite offshoots of the STAR TREK franchise, I must agree that this is just about as good as TV gets when it comes to writing and acting. Even from beneath layers of alien makeup. actor Harris Yulin gives a stimulating and thought- provoking portrayal of a genocidal maniac OR an inept soldier/excellent file clerk.Furthermore, if this story had been portrayed on almost any other war setting such as a civil war epic, WWII, Vietnam, Iraq...it still would be as powerful an experience especially with actors like Yulin and Visitor.",10
14,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Duet (TV Episode 1993)","Brilliant knock off of ""The Man in the Glass Booth""","This is one of the finest episodes in the entire Star Trek franchise.For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the movie and play ""The Man in the Glass Booth"", this would appear to be the source material for this episode. It is one of my favorites of the series and comes off better than the movie of the source work as well. The play is about a Jewish man who assumes the identity of a concentration camp commandant and presents himself to be tried for crimes against humanity. In the play it turns out that the man is not the commandant but a former prisoner who worked for him in return for favorable treatment, hence his guilt. This is very similar to the character in this episode even if he is not Bajoran (to complete the analogy to a Jew in a Nazi camp) but a weak ""good Cardassian"" who compliantly assists the actual war criminal who, like Gul Dukat, never harbored any sincere remorse (for Dukat this is settled in the episode ""Waltz"") over his acts against the Bajorans. This weakens it a bit since there is no element of guilty betrayal of one's own kind involved. In fact, the idea of a Cardassian with such qualms seems quite improbable based on every other Cardassian in the series and the apparent structure of the their society. The episode was good enough that I can suspend disbelief that far. It was also a pivotal moment for Kira Nerys who begins to turn from the one-sided viewpoint of a pure and embittered resistance fighter to a broader view necessary for her development on DS9.Unlike one other post I did like the series most of the time. There was a singular challenge in writing DS9 because it had to develop mainly on a single location and opportunities to credibly just bump into the next neat story and fresh characters were more limited than with the other series, as there was little actual trekking involved. DS9 is also the favorite of D.C. Fontana among the four Star Trek series she worked on. That should lend some respectability to the enjoyment of DS9. I will concede there are many dud episodes. In all the Star Trek series I look askance at the improbable and very anthropic inter-species mating that goes on. It was most pronounced in DS9 where it was not confined to curious single episode encounters (like Riker's ludicrous attempt to preserve the universal right to passionate boinking for the misfit of a voluntarily de-sexualized alien world in STNG (thin cover for a vague take on GLBT issues, and so much for the prime directive, again) or Dr. Crusher's close brush with inter-species lesbianism, boldly almost going where the original series could never have gone, even if Kirk did almost kiss Uhura, under telekinetic duress). In the case of DS9 the main purpose seems to be blatant pandering to a hoped for female audience by creating female-friendly relationship based story threads (i.e. soap opera). It is also used to create dubious parallels between Cardassia/Bajor and Japan/Korea during their respective occupations as in the episode ""Wrongs Darker than Death or Night"" exploiting a burst of publicity at the time of Japan's institutionalized rape of Korean ""comfort women"" to develop another, granted interesting, collaborator theme way too close for comfort for Major Kira. (Straight from today's headlines, holy Law and Order!, or yesterday's as in Dukat's turn as a cynical ersatz Jim Jones in cosmic Jonestown in the episode ""Covenant"") From that we move on to the ultimate nonsense that the lizard-like Cardassians can actually make babies with Bajorans! But at least we now know, thanks to Dr. Bashir and Ezri, that a Trill's spots go all the way down. But it was fun right down to the semi-apocalyptic conclusion where Sisko faces the the anti-Chr..er.. Dukat in the final conflict. Did anybody else notice a little bump in the canon from opening episode where the wormhole aliens say ""He is corporeal, He is linear, let's kill him"" to the final season when his mother IS a wormhole alien (sort of) and they had it planned all along?",9
15,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Duet (TV Episode 1993)",Masterfully Written and Deeply Emotional,"1.18 ""Duet""A sick Cardassian calling himself Marritza beams aboard the station but Major Kira places him under arrest when she realizes his condition means he was present at an occupation-era labor camp where countless atrocities were committed. But as Kira and Odo investigate him, they unravel layers of deception and try to figure who he really is and whether he should be held accountable for the crimes of his people.This is a powerful story and is exceptionally well-written. The tragic ending is quite an emotional gut punch. However, I will admit that after writing this review (but before publishing it), I looked at the other reviews on IMDB and was shocked to see how many 9s and 10s people were giving it. As good as the story is, this episode lacks in interesting scifi and doesn't have much in the way of powerful social commentary. It also ends up being rather irrelevant to the rest of the show except for some character development for Kira. Interesting scifi, big stakes for the story/characters, and/or important social commentary are the three things I look for that make an episode a 9 or 10 and this one doesn't have those qualities. Even though the writing and directing are basically flawless, I can't give ""Duet"" more than an 8/10 due to its small scope.THE GOOD-Cardassian eps are always good. They have such a fascinating society. They are ruled by an evil, fascist military dictatorship, yet there seems to be quite a few very good people in the society who want to change things. I think there is great hope for them as a people, even if their current state is not good.-Gul Dukat is an all-time great ST character and it's nice that he comes back for this ep, even if only in a limited role. The scene when he is talking to Odo is two great characters with rich history interacting and is probably the best scene of the ep.-Harris Yulin does a good job as Marritza. His booming voice is quite impressive and he makes a believable Gul. Little wonder he fooled Kira.-Story is very well written. Many twists as each layer of Marritza's deception is unveiled. The gut punch ending is very sad but adds to the emotional power of the ep (which was already high). It helps that there is no B plot in this episode, which lets the plot focus sharply on the dramatic conflict and the two main characters involved. This is peak first season writing.THE BAD-The Nazi parallels are a little overdone. I say that only because the writers clearly want to add subtlety and nuance to Cardassian society with this ep, but invoking Holocaust imagery of concentration camps and ethnic genocide turns the Cardassians into a stereotypical ""supremely evil"" foe. There is some thematic tension between those two ideas.-Kira ep. Again she isn't terrible but also isn't great, which is really the best we can ask for from her.THE UGLY-Sisko makes the wrong choice to put Kira in charge of the investigation. He shouldn't have caved. Proof that his choice was wrong is that she was ready to accept that Marritza was really Gul Darhe'el. Only Odo's always-suspicious nature led to them digging further into his story to uncover the real truth. Odo should have been in charge all along. But then again, that wouldn't have made for nearly as good a story, so for the sake of good drama I guess it's a good thing Sisko made a bad choice.",8

17,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Duet (TV Episode 1993)",Worthy of a movie. Worthy of an Oscar.,"This may have been the episode that made me a Deep Space Nine fan.Star Trek the Next Generation had always been on tv when I was growing up and my family watched it sometimes. Naturally I liked Star Trek TNG but when DS9 came around I didn't ""get"" it.... they're just on a weird space station 24/7 ??So now that I'm grown up, I'm very lucky that the reruns are currently still on (H&I network and others) fairly often. That's how I ended up catching this as a rerun.It's really true, that old concept about seeing the world as a child vs as an adult. Now that I'm older and a little bit wiser, I appreciate the story, the writing, the directing and the whole experience of a movie or a TV show -- and that's where this episode really shines.Many previous episodes of DS9 were spent trying to establish the plot or placate fans of the previous two versions of Star Trek. But this episode changed everything. Often times, Star Trek would make you think - and sometimes even re-think a social idea or concept. And they'r great episodes in many ways too. But this episode brings you in, twists the plot, ratchets up the tension, and in the end, genuinely makes you FEEL an emotion.This is powerful.I've seen this episode three times now and every time I see it, I get pulled into the moment, and when it's over, all I can help but say is ""G*d d*mn"" ... because you walk away feeling the weight of what happened.Between the writers, the cast and the directors, to say the least, this one hour episode of ""scifi"" transcended TV and reached deep into the soul - even if just for a moment- of those who actually stop and watch it. A rare accomplishment these days indeed.Bravo and well done, to all involved in this show. And thank you.",10

In this case ""Duet"" questions the idea on how to forgive others and forgive oneself in the face of horrendous circumstances. This episode doesn't disappoint, and whilst I don't think the question is completely answered here, it does open the door to understanding how we approaceh offence & grief. Watching Major Kira on her quest for justice (or vengeance), only to find her anger useless in the face of an enemy who takes pride in his deplorable acts, is fascinating viewing. What can any person really do, when face-to-face with a personification of evil? Is justice ever really enough when the horrors of the past can't be undone?The actors in this episode have rightly been given great credit for their performances.

It is, of course, Nazi Germany, and this man is despicable. He savors the deaths of Kira's people. But there are some interesting plot twists here which I won't reveal.

I really hated it...that is, until the ending--which made it all worth seeing.A Cardassian arrives at Deep Space 9 and he's suffering from an illness that only has been seen at one place--a Cardassian death camp where Bajorans were slaughtered. However, the guy lies again and again and again about who he is an why he lied. Kira, naturally, is ready to ship the guy back to Bajor to stand trial for war crimes--but Sisko and Odo aren't quite so sure he is a war criminal. What follows are many long and frustrating interviews between Kira and whoever this guy is. These interviews tend to be VERY talky and annoying--and they had me really dislike the show. BUT, what ultimately happens is pretty amazing and is worth seeing. So my advice is to sit tight and keep watching--it's worth your time. However, I don't think that the show was quite as terrific as some have indicated in their reviews--but to each his or her own.",8
0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" In the Hands of the Prophets (TV Episode 1993)",Introducing Kai Winn,"The episode that introduces Oscar-winner Louise Fletcher as Winn, a chillingly sinister religious zealot who would go on to appear in several more episodes during the series run. Still known as Vedek Winn at this point, she's in line to become the next Kai, the Bajoran's spiritual leader, and immediately brings intense conflict by busting into teacher Keiko's class and implying that teaching the young'uns science about the wormhole without mentioning the awesomeness of the prophets is tantamount to blasphemy. She then has Sisko over to her quarters, calls him Emissary, and justifies her actions by worrying about the ""consequences"" of what will happen if the kids aren't trained up right. Meanwhile, O'Brien and his hottie fellow engineer Neela investigate the death of an engineer who happened to borrow one of Miles's tools before getting melted in a plasma conduit. Was it an accident, or was he murdered? And by who? And why? Sisko appeals to another Vedek, the much mellower Bareil, to try to defuse the situation before the station descends into total chaos.It's not as brilliant as the preceding episode, ""Duet"", but ""Prophets"" is pretty good too, with a tightly interwoven set of story lines, further ugly truths about Bajoran culture (and beautiful faith in the goodness of individuals), and some good performances. Mostly, though, the characters are in service of the plot, and they are sketched somewhat broadly for DS9, which generally delights in nuance and complexity. It's a good stand-alone episode that shows the other sides of our allies, the Bajorans, and will make you think twice about blindly accepting them as victimized good guys. As usual, Louise Fletcher turns in a great performance as an ice-cold, dogmatic ball buster, and it's very entertaining to watch her and Avery Brooks's unflappable Sisko go head to head.",8
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" In the Hands of the Prophets (TV Episode 1993)",Introducing one of the best villains in the series...,"Vedek Winn (Louise Fletcher) obvious in its attack on modern fundamentalists vacant Kai positionAdding the character Vedek Winn (later Kai Winn) was a wonderful decision. The series needed an infusion of such a deliciously evil person and through the course of the show, Winn (Louise Fletcher) became came more and more entertaining to watch. So, because of this, ""In the Hands of the Prophets"" is well worth your time.When the show begins, Vedek Winn is visiting Deep Space 9. However, as she observes Keiko teaching about the wormhole, Winn in incensed that the existence of the wormhole isn't being attributed to the prophets but to some unknown aliens. Winn insists that her religious interpretation of this be taught or else she'll mobilize her followers to resist the Federation. When she does mobilize them, running the station becomes practically impossible. But what's worse is that Winn is also very willing to do ANYTHING to get her point across in this obvious power grab, as she is vying to become the Bajorans' next Kai (sort of like their Pope).This plot is clearly meant as a parallel to modern fundamentalists in their objections to some things taught in public schools. In the case of Kai Vedek, she exploits all this for her own selfish reasons-- which is what I liked about the show. I did find its attack on fundamentalism today to be a bit obvious, however its connection to Winn was rather interesting. Worth seeing--even if the show did seem a bit too obvious in its attack on fundamentalists today.",7

She is ambitious and ruthless, actually setting up a situation where her rivals can be killed by her followers. Once again, issues that have plagued us on earth are presented again.",8
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" In the Hands of the Prophets (TV Episode 1993)",Introducing Vedek Winn,"When Vedek Winn walks into Keiko's class as she teaches the children about the wormhole Keiko doesn't suspect that her lesson will lead to the Bajoran children being withdrawn from her classes and raised tensions across the station. In what appears to be a separate incident a Star Fleet officer is found dead in one of the plasma conduits at least what is left of him is. As the murder is investigated there is no obvious motive; he was killed before the incident at the school so it seems highly unlikely that it has anything to do with angry Bajorans. As tensions rise Commander Sisko attempts to defuse the situation but it is clear that Winn is itching for a fight with him and goes as far as to suggest that he is the devil! Sisko goes to see the moderate Vedek Bareil and he in return visits the station; it is at this point the two plots come together and we learn how Winn was involved in the earlier crime and just what her real goal is.Louise Fletcher is great in the role of Vedek Winn; making her seem a dangerously ambitious zealot who will stop at nothing to become Bajor's next spiritual leader, I look forward to seeing more of her character, as I'm certain we have not seen the last of her. Robin Christopher was also fairly good as the Chief's new assistant Neela even though it was fairly obvious that her character couldn't be as good as she first appeared.",8
5,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" In the Hands of the Prophets (TV Episode 1993)",Season One,"I'll be honest here and say that I only made it through three episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. I realized that this isn't an adequate amount of episodes to fairly judge this season.Here's the thing, though: I found myself so incredibly bored while watching those three episodes that (at least at this point) I have no desire to continue watching any further.From what I have heard (from people who really like DS9), the attraction is that the show is much more serialized than other other Trek show. It takes a few seasons to get to that point, though, and I just don't have the patience right now to weed through multiple seasons of average material to (potentially) get to that point.Another reason why I'm stopping my DS9 experiment before it really ever even got off the ground? Besides TOS & TNG (the series that everyone seems to enjoy), I'm a ""Voyager"" guy. I watched every episode of that series and very much enjoyed it. It seems like Voyager & DS9 are polar opposites in terms of type of show, so perhaps DS9 really isn't for me.What I didn't like in the early goings was how slow everything unfolded and how much politics was involved. It was like they took all the things I didn't care for on TNG (Klingon/Cardassian politics, plotted space wars) and made a show about that.I have no doubt that the show improves in quality as it goes along, but I just don't know if I'm ready (or ever will be) to put in the time to see it through.",4
6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" In the Hands of the Prophets (TV Episode 1993)",Best Episode of the Show so far,"1.19 ""In the Hands of the Prophets""A Bajoran religious leader named Winn shows up on the station and begins to stir up trouble over the fact that Keiko O'Brien is not teaching Bajoran religious doctrines in her school. She incites protests, which turn into violence, and a web of conspiracy behind these event is revealed to be both deep and sinister--and Winn is at the center of it all.With real stakes, relevant social commentary, a tight and gripping story, and incredible acting and writing across the board, this is a near-perfect episode. There are only a couple of flaws keeping it from getting a perfect score, but overall this is the best so far of the series. Great way to close out the season.This episode marks the first time in ST where religion is treated with real seriousness. Normally religious beliefs are used as flimsy cardboard props for the story (in all secular film these days, not just Star Trek), with no consideration given to the depth of conviction that people of faith can have. But here, when Jake tries to condemn the Bajorans' beliefs as ""stupid,"" Sisko defends them and explains how their faith means everything to them and that they have very valid reasons for believing what they believe. That is a conversation Gene Roddenberry would never have allowed to happen if he were still alive, but it is a refreshing change of tone from the usual treatment of religion as foolish superstition.Sisko makes a couple of comments in this ep that bear deeper discussion. The first is when he says that his philosophy is that there is room for all philosophies. While this sounds noble, it is actually a completely incoherent position to take. When faced with intolerance, the philosophy of ""tolerance for all"" must choose to either allow intolerance to exist (in violation of itself), or to suppress intolerance, also in violation of itself. This paradox is why, even though tolerance can be a good thing in many situations, it cannot be central to any coherent worldview. If you allow room for all philosophies, it means you must allow room for racism, fascism, authoritarianism, and any other -ism that is clearly and objectively evil. And if you try to draw a line between which -isms are allowed which ones aren't--and use tolerance as your primary guiding principle in drawing that line--you end up drawing it completely arbitrarily. I hope that Sisko has some deeper philosophy that guides him other than simply ""tolerance,"" though no indication of that is given here.The second comment is when he defends what happened to Galileo by pointing out that we can not look back and judge people from centuries ago based on our current values. This is actually an extremely important point, and one that is often overlooked. There is even a term for this type of bias--presentism--and it is a dangerous bias to fall into, because if we don't understand the values that led to mistakes in the past (like condemning Galileo), then we can't really learn from them. It's not helpful--in fact it's actively damaging--to look back and judge people as stupid or evil based on our present values and understanding of the world. And if you can't put yourself in the shoes of people from that time, then you shouldn't try to judge them. Ideally you should never try to judge them, but especially not when your perspective is warped by a bias such as presentism.THE GOOD-Winn is a great villain. Louise Fletcher played a similar role in her Oscar-winning performance alongside Jack Nicholson in the legendary One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and she does an excellent job of portraying a character with a saccharine and righteous exterior, and a heart of rotten, pure evil. If it were not for what a great character Gul Dukat becomes, I would say she is the best villain in all of Star Trek.-I really like Bareil's character. The actor reminds me a lot of Charleton Heston. I hate the direction that they take his story over the course of the next couple of seasons, but in this episode at least he is really good.-The acting, writing, directing, and dialogue are all incredible in this ep. Guest stars and main cast alike hit it out of the park with their performances (with one exception noted below).-Real stakes and powerful social commentary. This ep gets mega points for being brave enough to address religion with a bit of honesty, rather than the usual Hollywood tendency to give it a shallow and disdainful treatment.THE BAD-Apparently something went wrong with the casting or writing and Neela was supposed to be set up as a character in the previous few eps, but never was. Thus her sudden importance in this ep is abrupt, and her betrayal is not as emotionally powerful as it should have been. We are given zero indication for why a seemingly nice and well-adjusted person like her would throw her life away for someone like Winn. The actress who plays her is also just not good. If it weren't for the mishandling of her character, this would probably be a perfect ep.THE UGLY-Runabout used: unknown, but one is seen on the viewscreen in the classroom and the hatch of another is shown at the landing pad airlock.-Different classroom set from previous eps-Rules of Acquisition quoted: 7th -- ""Keep your ears open."" 4 rules quoted for the series.-Other count totals from the first season: 2 Kira Hulk-outs, 9 on-screen Odo shifts, and 2 runabouts still operational (Rio Grande and Ganges).-As we close the first season of the show, I am overall impressed by how high the quality of the writing has been. The show has a number of flaws, but the rich and likable characters really keep it interesting and enjoyable. My biggest complaints of the season are 1) the claustrophobia setting-wise, and 2) Dax is massively underutilized as a character. Both of those problems go away as the series progresses, but for now they are pretty frustrating, particularly the lack of Jadzia. For the most part, though, the show has lived up to its promise of showing a setting where adventure comes and has real and lasting consequences. The restriction of locating the show on an unmoving station has bred some amazing creativity, particularly in terms of the characters and their continual growth. Overall, this season is miles ahead of TNG season 1, and nearly on par with TOS's first season. On to season 2!",9
0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Image in the Sand (TV Episode 1998)",Great season opener,"As season seven opens the crew of Deep Space Nine are still trying to come to terms with the death of Jadzia Dax and the closing of the wormhole; hardest hit are her husband Worf who fears that because she didn't die in combat she can't enter the Klingon afterlife and Captain Sisko who has returned home to New Orleans and is wondering what he is meant to be doing now that he is cut off from the prophets.While playing the piano at his father's restaurant Sisko has a vision of desert planet were he digs in the sand and finds a woman, he does not recognise her but after creating a computer image of the face he learns that his father knew the woman. Sure that the vision was a message from the prophets he readies himself to find it, a task which he is aided in by his son, father and an old friend who appears shortly before he is ready to depart.Back on DS9 Bashir, O'Brien and Quark are trying to arrange for Worf to get a position on a Klingon ship so he may go into combat in Jadzia's name and earn her a place in the afterlife. Things seem to be going well for Kira who is now in acting command of the station but things might get awkward when the Romulans ask to use an uninhabited Bajoran moon to build a hospital.This was a good opening episode which mainly sets up the story for the next episode as it leaves each of the three story lines open. As this series has some of the best characters of any Star Trek incarnation it didn't suffer for being more talky than most.",8
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Image in the Sand (TV Episode 1998)",lots of introductions ONLY,"This first episode of the final season of ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"", ""Image in the Sand"" is an important one but not an especially satisfying one. This is because lots of story elements are introduced but there is no resolution of any of them. In other words, you get a taste for what WILL be resolved in the future on the series. When the show begins, Colonel Kira (yes, she's now a colonel) is practically having a love affair with the Romulan leader stationed on DS9. The two ladies seem to be in sync and spend a lot of time congratulating each other...until Kira learns that this 'nice' Romulan is up to something.As for Sisko, he's been off the base for three months and no one has heard from him. Since the release of the Pah-Wraiths, no one has heard from the Prophets and Sisko is out sulking or thinking at his father's restaurant on Earth. Fortunately for his faith, the Prophets deliver him yet another vision...but there is danger just around the corner.Worf is naturally bummed. After all, his wife was just murdered by Dukat and since she didn't die in battle, he cannot hope to meet her in Klingon heaven, Sto-vo-kor. Or, is there some way?And, when the show ends, Dax's new symbiot, Ezri Dax, is introduced. But apart from introducing herself, you know NOTHING about this new series regular.As I said, there are a bunch of plots introduced but no real resolution. The next episode picks up with these but it will take some time for the plots to come into their own. As a result, it's an important episode but one that isn't very satisfying on its own.",7
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Image in the Sand (TV Episode 1998)",Introducing Ezri Dax,"Of all the Season Openers of DS9, this one set up the final story arc so well that our interest was piqued even with the loss of Jadzia Dax.There has been a minor scattering of the main characters of DS9. A new Bajoran Religion of people worshiping the Pah-Wraiths has emerged. The Celestial Temple has been closed and the Bajoran Orbs are all dark and ""The Sisko"", not knowing what he is to do, is on Earth, mainly sitting in front of a piano at his Father's (Played by the great Brock Peters) New Orleans Restaurant. Worf seeks Honour for his deceased wife Jadzia, who was brutally murdered by the Pah-Wraith/Gul Dukat entity.And so while all of these disparate elements converge, The Sisko sees the image of a woman - A woman who plays an important role in this final story arc. And we meet Ezri Dax, who was not a Trill Host Initiate but was compelled to offer herself as Host to Dax due to an emergency.And this is what I mostly want to talk about - Nicole De Boer is Ezri-Dax. And although she is not explored in this episode that much, she does come to be a major plot element of this final season.When I initially watched these episodes that showed how another Host would be after joining with Dax, I hated the Ezri character and I thought she was rather silly. But I have not seen these eps since they were played on TV in the 1998-1999 season, it has been almost 12 years since the final season of DS9, and now I can watch these final eps, and it is as if I am seeing them for the first time- I had seen each of the eps of the previous seasons, more than once, so I was very familiar with the DS9 story: Of Season Seven I had only vague recollections. And so in December of 2011, I am viewing the final season of what I think of now as a great Trek show, one that was basically dismissed by Trek canonisers because of its vast differences from Gene Roddenberry's Future Earth.Well, this series was NOT about Earth, as The Next Generation and TOS was. This series was shown, in the Season 6 Ep ""Far Beyond the Stars"" - as the imaginings of an under-appreciated coloured Sci-Fi writer of the 40's and 50's, about a Coloured man who was a widower with a young son being the commander of a huge Space Station on the edge of Known Space - A Sci Fi story that would NOT have been published back then. And that story of DS9 was never allowed to be published due to that particular racial bias. So, the way I see it, is that ""Benny Russel"" is the actual creator of Deep Space Nine, long before Roddenberry - And since the story was allegedly conceived in the Post War years, the story has WW-II elements in it. Oh yes, we know that the concept was shown to Sisko in a vision of the Prophets, but who is to say, that there never was a Benny Russel who was never allowed to publish a story of a coloured Captain - In charge of a Multi-Racial and Multi-Species ""Space Station""? Part of Quantum Physics states that our imaginings, the books we read, the TV shows we watch, COULD be other Quantum Realities - Or at least could be stories about ""Alternate Time-lines"" - This is why I like Fringe so much, because it explores that even more than it was explored in Next Generation and DS9.Getting back to Ezri-Dax, it is now apparent to me, that Nicole De Boer was carefully cast, and actually uses many of Terry Farrel's mannerisms, eye movements, ways of speaking - This is one of the best continuations of a character I have ever seen, and I BELIEVE it – I really believe now, that Ezri Dax contains the memories of Jadzia Dax, and Curzon, and all of the hosts of the Dax Symbiote. Sometimes, I forget she is not really Nicole De Boer, who is actually an actress of Merit (The Dead Zone series) - She seems at times to be a shorter version of Terry Farrel. And so as Jadzia was the science officer, Ezri is now a ""Ships Counselor"" of sorts - Because that is the Ezri host's special talent- But when required, she can, and does, tap into the previous knowledge of the Jadzia symbiote, and can sometimes perform a task which a science officer would do. This Season, even explores how the one Host who was a murderer could help Ezri solve a Murder Investigation on the Station. And so, I just say it here, this season opener sets up a whole universe of possibilities for ontinuation of the DS9 story arcs.When I watch this DS9 Ep in particular, the Original Trek Story Arc was still strong, but I knew, that this was the end of Trek the way we had known it for the last 15 years of the TNG universe. So: This episode, represents, to me at least, that Trek was turning down the lights, drinking a cup of Tarkalian Tea, and getting ready for Bed - To be Awakened by JJ Abrams in 2009.",10

His exchange with Weyoun early in the episodes says a lot about who he is as a man. He's an underrated and often over looked supporting character but I absolutely love him. New Dax is easy on the eyes and easy to like. Nog is the anti-Scrappy Doo, Jake is the anti-Wesley Crusher.Verdict: Strong start to a new season.

Far Beyond the Stars, was by far one of my favorite episodes, the story of black writer Benny Russell that at one point could be considered the """" creator ""of the Star Trek universe, it was absolutely fascinating.

2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Shadows and Symbols (TV Episode 1998)",The Secret Origin and Godhood of Benjamin Sisko,"This 2nd episode of the Season Seven Intro two-parter finalizes the 3 main arcs that all happen simultaneously:The Sisko's discovery of who he really is and the exact nature of his connection to Bajor and The Prophets, Worf's final Homage to Jadzia and Dax's return to the series in a new host, and Kira's confrontation with a Romulan Senator who wants to keep weapons of mass destruction on one of Bajor's Moons.There could have been a 4th arc: The Dax Symbiote's implantation into a new host who was not prepared for the experience of dealing with the 7 lifetime experiences contained in the Symbiote: Instead, the Benny Russells of DS9 chose to write that part of the arc into several carry over episodes, showing Ezri's adjustment to hosting Dax.Oddly enough, they chose to continue the story of Benny Russell as well, in a ""false vision"" from the Pah-Wraiths, who were trying to prevent him from opening the Orb of the Emissary.The Orb is the key to Season 7's opening: And also to the re-opening of the Wormhole and the ejection of the Pah-Wraith entity named Kosst Amojan.This episode refers back to the ""Novelty Episode"" Far Beyond The Stars, assigning more than mere novelty to that part of the story. As The Sisko is intrinsically linked to The Prophets, Benjamin Sisko is intrinsically linked with Benny Russell, whether he was a real historical figure who originally wrote ""Deep Space Nine"" in the 50's or not.The Cyclic Story of DS9 is actually created here, in this 7th season episode: Without the events uncovered here, the entire series never would have happened. Sisko discovers that he actually IS a ""Wormhole Alien,"" at least in part. This foreshadows events in the final episode.But the Pah-Wraiths really don't want The Sisko to open that Orb, first they send an assassin from Bajor, one of the followers of the new Pah-Wraith religion. When that fails, they send the false vision.Ultimately, Sisko had Dax with him, and she helped him get past the false vision. All of these aspects are blended very well in this Episode, which also looks at the natures of both Kira and Worf. And there is also an unlikely connection of Worf to Bashir, Quark, and O'Brien, through Jadzia.These episodes were a very satisfactory introduction to the Brobdingnagian scope of Season 7.Speaking of Brobdingnagian, we get to see the crew of Worf and Martok's bird of prey ""The Rotarran"" (along with Quark, Bashir and O'Brian), destroy a Dominion artifact of Brobdingnagian proportions. And they do a wonderful number on the thing, it's beautiful. You have to remember a lot of this was practical effects, not CGI. Because they had a genius working on the Star Trek shows back then, Dan Curry.Which was amazing. But what would help put the icing on the cake of this episode would have been to see Benny Russell/The Sisko take that roller-brush and lavish Dr. Wykoff (Casey Biggs) with TWO coats of paint across his face!In my mind that's what happens anyway, when I watch this episode.",10

As Sisko, his father and son and Ezri head to the desert planet of his vision to find the Orb of the Emissary other members of the DS9 crew are facing their own troubles. Bashir, O'Brein and Quark have joined Worf on his quest to get Jadzia into the Klingon equivalent of Valhalla, this mission involves taking on a the defences of the Cardassian shipyards which they plan to destroy. If two interesting story lines weren't enough we have a third when Kira learns that the Romulans are stockpiling weapons on the moon where they were told they could build a hospital, this leads to a stand off between the Bajorans and the far better armed Romulans.This episode has many good points; it gives us a great introduction to Ezri Dax, played well by Nicole de Boer, it can't be easy joining a well established ensemble cast were all the other main members have been there since episode one.

Especially since he is the family Captain; something Kirk and Picard (My favorite) were not, for different reasons. I have no one to blame for this, especially since the effervescent Avery Brooks played his part brilliantly as usual. His dedication to the ""wormhole aliens"" was just a bit unnerving in this one, given his wonderful family.The other issue I have with S&S is that Worf shouldve grieved more heavily for his fallen love. I know many have brought this up with the subsequent films (completely warranted criticisms) but between Quark's whining and the rest of the rag tag crews banter...I just felt empty. This was the love of Worf's life, and he shouldve plunged a dagger in the ferengi's neck for his disrespect.I think this episode is a bad example of what DS9 has to offer. As a series it was a worthy follow up to the brilliant Next Generation, and vastly superior to the poorly written and badly acted tripe of Voyager and Enterprise. For a good example of what DS9 was: I suggest ""In the Pale Moonlight"" a tour de force performance by Brooks and a damn fine piece of Trek writing.",
7,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Shadows and Symbols (TV Episode 1998)",Some answers....,"The first episode of season 7 of ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" was a bit frustrating because it introduced so many plots but offered no resolution. Fortunately, this second season clears up many of these...and leaves a few still dangling.When the show begins, Ezri is showing that she is no Jadzia Dax. Ezri Dax is a bit afraid of flying on the shuttle and looks a bit panicked. Worst of all, however, is that you learn that she is a counselor--something that many Trek fans will despise!! Her full character will have to be revealed in subsequent episodes.Ezri Dax is accompanying Sisko on his vision quest to locate some new orb. I agree with one reviewer who disliked this plot, as Sisko was so obsessed that the folks he brought along (including his elderly dad) were unimportant and the scorching planet they arrived on seems ready to kill the old man...and Sisko is indifferent. Worf and his guy pals all are on their mission to somehow get Jadzia Dax into Sto-vo-kor by proxy. An odd notion indeed--and one requiring a brave deed in battle.The final plot involves Colonel Kira and a Romulan Senator having a run-in and neither seems willing to back down. Someone better, of the fragile alliance will be in jeopardy.The resolutions to these plots is decent--but I am not a huge fan of some of the encounters Sisko has with his Prophet friends. I did, however, find it fascinating just how long-term their game plan is and how he was NOT chosen to be the emissary by random chance. Interesting and worth seeing.",7

Masculine women with male hair cuts probably appeal to a certain market segment, but the series already had the Lieutenant. Why have two ugly women?

Hardest hit is Worf who can't accept Ezri and makes her so awkward that she tells Captain Sisko that she plans to resign from Star Fleet and return to Trill. Before she can leave Sisko asks her to see Garak as he is suffering from claustrophobia which is preventing his vital code breaking work. Initially he isn't keen to open up to the young trainee councillor but eventually she gets to the bottom of his problem. She also confronts Worf and although things still aren't perfect between them Worf accepts her for who she is and not as his wife's replacement.I really enjoyed this episode even though there was little action and no real sense of threat, probably because it was centred on two of my favourite characters; Ezri Dax and Garak, who are played well by Nicole de Boer and Andrew Robinson.",8
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Afterimage (TV Episode 1998)",Ezri comes off as annoyingly lacking confidence...let's hope the writing for this character improves!,"The Dominion and Cardassians are involved in an all-out war with the Romulans, Klingons and the Federation. Life seems tenuous, that's for sure and at any minute the station could be attacked. So, in light of all this, ""Afterimage"" is a particularly frustrating and misplaced episode. Instead of deep and important topics, the main one explored here is that Ezri Dax feels unloved and unwanted by her fellow crew members as well as VERY uncertain about herself or whether she should remain on DS9. In addition, she talks about feeling space sick...which is a bit annoying. Although someone MUST have thought this would make her an endearing or interesting character, it just makes you wish that Terry Farrell had not left the show! Perhaps in a few episodes this won't be the case, but for now Nicole de Boer (Ezri) has a tough job winning over fans based on the character which was written for her. I know I sure felt frustrated by what I'd seen so far.Apart from listening to Ezri whine and act like a little girl*, Ezri does manage to help Garak a bit using her counselor skills. Poor Garak was an abused child and she helps him gain control over his fears. Plus, his bluntness enables him to say what most fans of the show were feeling--that Ezri should 'man up', so to speak. Also, Worf continues his quest to be the most annoying and grouchy member of the crew...and he's doing a great job!*One thing I LOVED about ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" over previous Trek shows is its female characters. In the original ""Star Trek"", women were mostly decorations for sexy outfits. In ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", they were just annoying--with Tasha Yar being a one-dimensional angry lady who goes on and on about rape gangs, the Doctor being very inconsistently written and Counselor Troi being too, too 'touchy feely' (though she did improve a bit over time). On the other hand, Major/Colonel Kira definitely came into her own as the show progressed and Jadzia Dax was one of the best characters. Let's hope Ezri can grow into something more...but her sitting and crying in this episode is NOT a good sign for the future!",5

Ezri is thus the 9th host and shares the memories and feelings of the 8 previous hosts including Jadzia who was an integral part of the station and the show for the last 6 years and the wife of Worf. This particular situation makes for some great drama trying to figure out how to interact with someone who has the memories and feelings of someone you know but that isn't that person. This is what science-fiction does best and DS9 gets Les Landau to direct actors who are as familiar as they can with their characters in the show's last season and put new wide-eyed and confused Ezri Dax (and new actress Nicole De Boer) to thread the line between this complicated situation.Add Andrew Robinson as the enigmatic Elim Garak for character development and repartee, quirky Quark for warmth, brash Bashir for flirty friendship and bravado, as well as Avery Brooks' Sisko who not only knew Jadzia Dax but also Curson Dax, the 7th host. We have all the complexities of a great chess match and an episode that is perhaps match by ""Duet"" as one of the best Thrill episode ever. One of the best and most difficult episode all together when you take into account the 6 year backstory of all the characters culminating into this unspoken conflict (or conflicts).The dialog and story are strong but the beauty is really in the nonverbal nuances, the tone, the double entendre and deeper interplay. In that sense, the episode may be for DS9 connoisseurs instead of passerby, but it still showcase strong narrative impetus. Also it elevates itself by the quality of questions it raises and the satisfying yet not quite resolved resolution.Ezri is in search of herself, but we are glad we have found her.

This episode involves her integration onto the station. She has several issues. First of all, she has a devil of a time dealing with Garak's claustrophobia. He is hostile toward her and she is shy and vulnerable. Also, Bashir and Quark were carrying a torch for Jadzia who still inhabits her thoughts and memories. Worf, of course, sees her carrying his wife in her being. She has her ups and downs, but she is truly a strong woman. I hope her appearance is a good one for the series.",8

I'm not surprised at all that Rom and Quark didn't know the first thing about baseball since there's no profit in it haha. It would have been nice if the DS9 team actually won the game, but it teaches a good lesson in humility. The Vulcan couldn't understand why they were celebrating when they lost, but that's Vulcans for you. They don't know the first thing about emotions since they don't use theirs, so the idea of keeping your chin up after a loss is foreign to them. Overall a great episode that I highly recommend.",10

2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Take Me Out to the Holosuite (TV Episode 1998)",Lighter episode that takes a break from the war,Amid all the darkness and despair of the Dominion War the occupants of Deep Space Nine get to have a bit of a break when the captain of a passing Vulcan ship challenges Sisko to a game of baseball. He readily accepts the challenge before realising that apart from himself and his son nobody else on board has any idea how to play. He has two weeks to teach his players how to play the game before taking on the Vulcan's who are naturally stronger and faster anyway.Being a lighter hearted episode there are a few good laughs; Odo practising giving people out was hilarious as was Chief O'Brien getting into the spirit of things by chewing gum... which he had flavoured with Whisky. I was rather surprised however that Quark wasn't running a book on the outcome of the game.I had expected to dislike this episode as I dislike most episodes which take place on the holosuite and I'm not that interested in baseball. However as I watched the story grew on me and the ending wasn't the cliché one might have expected.,6
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Take Me Out to the Holosuite (TV Episode 1998)",lightweight but amusing episode,"A 'comic relief' episode that takes you mostly out of the ongoing 'Dominion War' story arc of the last season.DS9 was already well past its prime by this time, but the characters were well-established, and the goings-on and subcultures and whatnot of a busy space station made for good background stories. In this episode, another badly-overused plot device, a holodeck, allows the crew to accept a challenge to a baseball game form an old associate of Captain Sisko, but that's not the fun part.The fun comes in the relationship between Sisko and his onetime colleague, between Vulcans and Humans.There seems to be a largely-understated antipathy between the races. Vulcans can be annoyingly condescending, while they find Humans utterly inscrutable.Sisko's Vulcan roommate in the Academy was a competitive rival with a clinical interest in human psychology. To Sisko's annoyance, he occasionally found himself the involuntary subject of his roommate's papers and theses.Years later, knowing Sisko to be a lifetime baseball fan, his rival challenges Sisko and his crew to a game. Sisko accepts the challenge. He knows the Vulcans will be studying his team (DS9 crew) and probably get a bit annoying, but he can't resist a baseball game and the crew needed a diversion...The Vulcan team, with no concept of 'fun', naturally plays to win. What other purpose could there be to play?Sisko and crew play to have a great time.Imagine the Vulcans' hollow victory, chagrin and befuddlement when the game is over and the DS9 team parties, celebrating its loss.",7
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Take Me Out to the Holosuite (TV Episode 1998)",Great episode to see the whole cast interacting,"I must say any negative reviews of this episode can not be made by a true Star Trek fan. This is quintessential trek.Take some alien sci-fi, mixed with some down to earth humanity, throw in some humor. Voila half of the original series followed that model in some shape or form.I would have given this episode a 9/10 except the ending struck me as hollow. It's a hilarious ending, with the crew taking jabs at the Vulcan, all the while his emotions seeping through his cold exterior. But then Julian hits the nose on the head ""To manufactured triumph!"" There is no real moral to the story, other than I guess that people can be happy and find solace in friends and family, even after a defeat. I just expected a more concrete point to the story.I guess ultimately it is meant to be light heart-ed, and the flimsy moral to the story serves to be light heart-ed as well.Also I love seeing the entire crew together on camera at the same time. Makes for a deep scene with lots of real emotion. The camera panning to ""catch"" Lita kissing Rom at the end is perhaps my favorite moment of the episode.",8

Sisko's lifelong Vulcan adversary has taught the game of baseball to his crew. They have polish and understanding of the game. Jake and his father are really the only ones who have a knowledge of the game. Baseball can be pretty complicated to one who has no experience with it. To play the game it takes some skills practiced over time. As a lifetime fan and player, there are some things that don't wash. One is Worf's inability to even touch the ball with the bat. He is the Zen master and has that second sight. I thought it would have been fun for him to hit a 500 foot home run. The others, for all their good intentions are as hapless as can be. It's an interruption from the intense issues of the war. But as a baseball episode, it doesn't do very well.",5
6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Take Me Out to the Holosuite (TV Episode 1998)","Pretty bad, sadly","While I like baseball, I really can't stand this episode. Like most things, the comedy can be kind of hit or miss. Worf's parts are often funny, but the rest of it is pretty bland. In terms of structure, the episode seems a little bit confused, and the plot itself is rather contrived. While Vulcans can certainly be annoying, the one in this episode pushes it farther than the usual Vulcan arrogance into very odd illogical, having apparently trained his crew to play a sport that's no longer even played by humans, just so he can rub it in Sisko's face when they win. While that seems like a pretty illogical waste of time for one Vulcan, how he convinced an entire team of Vulcans to do this, when they could be doing just about anything else, is totally beyond me. Also, while I can't really be nitpicky enough to hold it against the episode, it is kind of funny to watch Odo try to make second base calls from behind home plate. The camera doesn't very well hide the fact that he's way too far away, and Jake is between him and the base. Although Rene's dancing about to try and get a good look doesn't even try to hide it, so maybe it's an intentional, if subtle joke.Also, props to many of the actors for their attempts to look like they don't know how to swing a baseball bat. No one quite stands up to Nana Vistor, who apparently is genuinely quite bad at baseball, but it's a hard thing to fake, and they put a good effort into it. **Spoilers for the Ending**Ultimately the episode would just be a bit dull, unless you really, really like baseball, or the jokes hit home. What drags it down is the ending. After the DS9 crew has lost the game fairly badly (I would say pathetically, but, as a long time Royals fan, I've seen worse), they all meet up at Quark's bar for a round of drinks, when the Vulcan manager walks in. Rather than actually showing the team as being happy, having had fun in spite of losing, they all seem rather bitter instead. What actually looked like the crew having a good laugh suddenly turns into mocking the Vulcan manager, but without any undertones of good humor behind it. Instead of actually showing they can be cheerful in defeat, the whole thing seems to be a bitter, angry show of ""happiness"" and forced laughter, all done out of pure spite. Certainly the Vulcan deserves it, but instead of the episode showing us how humans aren't inferior to Vulcans because they can have fun even without winning, we see how humans aren't inferior to Vulcans because they can be bitter, spiteful, and pissy in the face of losing.",3

If you don't know the game you'll just sit there most of the time wondering what's going on on screen.Since I neither know the rules nor get any of the supposed in-jokes the whole episode just didn't make any sense to me.There seem to be others who did like it so if you know baseball this might be an episode for you.

I know this isn't exactly a noble pursuit, but so be it. When it comes to ""Take Me Out to the Holosuite"", it's THE episode I remembered more than any other--and NOT for a good reason. I remember it as the absolutely worst episode of the series--one that is 100% irrelevant and which embarrassed me the first time around. Being a reasonably fair person, however, I am making myself watch it again--just in case my recollection is in error.When the show begins, you see Captain Sisko and his previously never mentioned arch-nemesis, some haughty Vulcan who commands an all- Vulcan ship for the Federation. Out of nowhere, the Vulcan suggests his crew battle DS9 in a baseball game--and Sisko quickly agrees. Sure, he loves baseball but the game is extinct on Earth and no one else on the station knows much about how to play--let alone beat the Vulcans.So, is it as rotten as I remembered? Yep. The episode is the epitome of the term 'lightweight' and is evidence that the series might just be jumping the shark! Too many more like this, and you'll be praying for the end of the series!

0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Chrysalis (TV Episode 1998)",Doctor in love,This is another stand alone episode that doesn't advance the main story arc but concentrates on Doctor Bashir who is trying to cure a young genetically engineered woman called Sarina who has been in a catatonic state all of her life. She has been brought to the station by three other genetically engineered people who while brilliantly clever have personality disorders which make it hard for them to function amongst normal people. Once the doctor has performed the operation it is clear that she doesn't suffer from these disorders and she gets on well with Dr Bashir's friends and very well with the doctor himself who finds himself falling in love with her only to find that she appears to have slipped back in to her catatonic state.Alexander Siddig does a fine job as Doctor Bashir and Faith Salie did well guest starring as Sarina. I found the other genetically engineered guest characters somewhat irritating although that was down to the way the characters were written rather than the acting. Over all it wasn't a bad episode but I look forward to a return to the main story arc.,7
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Chrysalis (TV Episode 1998)",Meh,"I would not be assuming the mantle of Captain Insightful by pointing out that Statistical Probabilities, the episode where we were first acquainted with dr Bashir's genetically enhanced patients, was hardly worth a sequel. The characters were rather annoying and the show's view on transhumanism rather shallow.Despite that, this episode is slightly better, as there is less focus on the obnoxious characters - aside from them providing silly resolutions, with corny lines like ""you can't break the lows of physics but you can bend them"".The problem is that the main themes of the episode have received better treatment elsewhere - the loneliness of the genius is something that has been shown both in Star Trek, and DS9 in particular, since Bashir is not so different from Sarina, and elsewhere. For instance, there is an episode of House that goes pretty deep into it. Additionally, the whole plot is pretty reminiscent at first of the film Awakenings, although the show, understandably, hints but eventually backs away from that bleak narrative.In any case, the view of genetically engineered humans as human computers who can solve problems an hour after becoming acquainted with a field remainds naive.",6
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Chrysalis (TV Episode 1998)","Through a 2018 lens: stirring, challenging & profound","As the pieces began moving into position, I expected to loathe this episode. The cliches were lined up & waiting, it was obvious. And at times, I felt incredibly uncomfortable. How can someone so incomprehensibly intelligent by our standards be so devoid of basic understanding? But the way it played out was, at least viewed through the prism of 2018, remarkably compelling.Dr. Julian Bashir is a lonely, frustrated man. In our modern pop culture terms one might ascribe him the maligned titled of ""involuntarily celibate"", or someone who is frustrated at their inability to find a mate and, perhaps through lack of humility or self-awareness, places the blame onto their environment. They believe fate has conspired their unhappiness.There was Jazdia. Julian came onto her too strong (in her own words) & the failure of winning her love left him distraught for seasons on end. Being forced to watch her marry a Klingon, someone so unlike him; a lesser mind but superior physicality. His frustrations grew anew at the end of the previous season, culminating with her unfortunate end.But Jazdia is reborn in this season, as Ezri, who offhandedly informs Julian that had she not met said Klingon, she (as Jazdia) would've probably ended up with him. This was actually meant to foreshadow the character Ezri's own attraction (as well as her newfound confusion sorting the thoughts of lives past & present), but to Julian it must've ripped open one of his deepest wounds anew.In Chrysalias, Julian helps revive Sarina, a highly-intelligent beautiful woman, from a vegetative state. We brace for the inevitable: the lonely man, despite being a doctor treating a patient, falls hard for Sarina. It's creepy, it's uncomfortable. In 1998 that was probably less of the intention; in many ways, the self-awareness of mainstream romantic storytelling has matured by leaps & bounds since then. & Star Trek is smart, so the conclusion hits its necessary mark, but the navigation must've felt slightly less gaudy at the time.But now in 2018, one can't help but think of those involuntary celibates, the incels, the lonely men raging online at their inability to find a mate, and consider how they might act in such a situation. If you take that filter, and apply several strong dashes of naive innocence, you get Julian Bashir trying to woo Sarina. Only he doesn't woo her. He doesn't put the patient effort into wooing her. He *expects* romance, and because she is so indebted to him for rescuing her from her aimless slumber, she reciprocates. He kisses her first & she returns the kiss. He's happy but it's there for us all (& to the show's credit, Chief too) to see: the relationship isn't about *her*, it's about him. She's his escape from loneliness. He uses her to ease his deep-seated pain of failing to find companionship.I'm sure a lot of modern-minded people will see the ending as a somewhat superficial way to wrap up a fairly problematic story, but to me, the light touch made the whole more palatable. Sarina is able to let go of him & reject his absurd advances in a way that doesn't exacerbate his fragile state; she's undeniably the stronger of the two of them. She deserves our admiration while Julian deserves our sympathy. Being a man is easy, but sometimes it's excruciatingly difficult too, in ways that we men don't realize until we step back & breathe, focus & make sense of the moment. I think this episode presents that frustrating fact in a very compelling fashion.",9
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Chrysalis (TV Episode 1998)","Why did they do a sequel to ""Statistical Probabilities"" in the first place?!","One of the poorer episodes of season 6 of ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" was ""Statistical Probabilities""--a show featuring a group of genetically modified folks who were misfits and were forced to live in an institution because of their mental problems. Dr. Bashir became friends with these folk and the episode had MANY embarrassing moments because it was so poorly written. So imagine my surprise that they would do a follow-up--a follow-up that I assume many folks would NOT have looked forward to seeing.In this new episode, Dr. Bashir is surprised when his misfit friends show up on the base unexpectedly and in Starfleet uniforms. No, they are NOT members of the fleet--they are just once again social misfits who think this is cute. It isn't. Anyway, once they're on the base, somehow Bashir gets the idea to do some medical procedure to Sarina to try to bring her out of her mute and somewhat catatonic state. It is a success and almost instantly Bashir is smitten by her and is making plans for their lives together.This episode is embarrassing--as are most of Bashir's attempts to court women. The problems are that he has no real ability to engage in a normal manner with women--almost as if he has Asperger's Syndrome. He also has ZERO sense of ethics, as no responsible doctor would almost instantly begin hitting on their patient! Sarina's reaction to the ultra-creepy Doctor isn't at all surprising.

6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Chrysalis (TV Episode 1998)",The Biogenes return,"From ""Statistical Probabilities""And it was kind of fun to see them return to DeepSpace Nine, the way that they do it was kind of unique, they sneak in under the radar, but in plain sight.Hilary Shepard who plays Lauren, always looks magnificent as this character. But the real highlight here was Faith Salie as ""Serina""- it is like a light switch being flipped.This episode is mostly about her. All I can say about this character is that the title of the episode matches what happens to the character.And that brings me to my very minor complaint. This episode is a lot of fun up until about halfway, and then Bashir gets totally sidetracked. Probably because there was no more Jadzia for him to pine over, all of a sudden this episode is no longer an episode involving the genetically modified people, suddenly their characters are no longer the focus, and something else happens, everything gets suddenly very deep and in some cases tiresome, and we can understand something that Sarina does in this episode, because we feel it.I was hoping that the Biogenes would do something totally off or crazy like they did the first time they appeared, but after about halfway through, their appearance in this episode is reduced to practically nothing. Of course Bashir needs to consult them because something happens that they are familiar with, but that is basically the last time that we ever see them.It's not that I didn't like this episode but that it should have included more of the Biogenes. Mainly it's about Bashir making another incredibly stupid mistake (again).And we've had plenty of those kinds of episodes, this episode had so much potential but it didn't live up to all of it.

3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Treachery, Faith and the Great River (TV Episode 1998)",One of my favorite episodes,"I always loved Weyoun's character. This episode is perfect for anyone who also enjoys him. The story begins with Odo informing Kyra that he received a message from a Cardassian informant that was believed to have been executed. Odo takes a runabout to the planet he was told to meet his informant friend but instead, Weyoun is there waiting for him. Weyoun tells Odo that he no longer considers himself part of the Dominion and wishes to defect. Odo becomes irritated how much Weyoun worships him even though that's how the Vorta were programmed. On their way back to DS9, they are contacted by Damar and the new Weyoun clone and tells the other Weyoun to either surrender or kill himself. Damar wants the runabout destroyed but new Weyoun is hesitant because Odo is still considered a Founder despite the fact that Odo is essentially neutral. Damar eventually talks Weyoun into having the runabout destroyed and just not telling the Founder that Odo was on board. Sadly, the defecting Weyoun ends up activating his termination program in order to save Odo. I just didn't understand why Weyoun didn't fake his own death but that would have taken away the moment where we see just how much the Vorta look up to the Founders. He knew Odo didn't want to be looked at as a God but his dying wish was to receive Odo's blessing. The other plot line in this episode is that Chief O'Brien is ordered by Captain Sisko to fix the Defiant in a few days with a part that isn't on DS9. Nog helps O'Brien by doing trade after trade after trade to get the stabilizer. Things start disappearing on the ship like Sisko's desk and Martok's cases of blood wine that his wife sent him. It's discovered that Nog used O'Briens authorization code to make those deals. Just when things seem bleak for him, the Captain's desk is returned on time, Martok ends up getting cases of blood wine that are better quality than the ones his wife sent, and the stabilizer arrives in time for O'Brien to install it.

When Work goes to see the General it is clear that there is bad blood between the two of them, it later emerges that Kor blocked Martok's original application to become an officer because he wasn't from the right social class. Eventually Worf gets him a position but only as third officer. Initially the crew are in awe of Kor but when the senior officers are injured in an attack he takes command and it is clear that his memory isn't what it once was as he thinks he is fighting the Federation alongside an old friend who in fact died many years before.

0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Siege of AR-558 (TV Episode 1998)",The other side of Starfleet,"We are all used to the immaculate uniforms, powerful starships, and the cold harshness of combat in space portrayed in this series. But this episode shows the other side of the war, and portrays it with a realistic edge that I found surprising and mesmerizing.Somehow this episode positively nailed the atmosphere of soldiers doing the grim business of holding on to an objective in a place that will be forgotten by everyone except for those who were there - like so many other places in so many other wars. Everyone has lost a friend, everyone is scared and angry and everyone is doing their job with an air of fatality that is riveting. For the most part, the enemy are an unseen force that everyone knows is equally determined and skilled, and of course they must be dealt with.I particularly enjoyed Quark's role in this episode, an outspoken outsider who begins to understand more and more what his nephew and the other starfleet personel go through just because of orders and circumstance. This is a great episode that shows a rougher side of life in the future, and a rougher side to the characters we are so familiar with. This is some great writing, acting, and directing - the tense moments and 1000 yard stares really made this a fine episode for contemplation.",9
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Siege of AR-558 (TV Episode 1998)",Grittier than usual episode,"This was a particularly good episode of DS9 which concentrates on the action which is far grittier than most Star Trek episodes. It looks like the crew of the Defiant are just going out on a routine resupply mission, so routine that Quark has joined them to scout out business opportunities for the Ferengis. As they approach their destination they are attacked by a Dominion ship suggesting the area isn't as safe as they thought. Once on the ground they find things are much worse than they thought; the base is down to about a third of its original strength and it appears that some of the troops there have been in combat too long and are beginning to either cracking up or enjoying them selves a bit too much.While they are on the ground the Dominion attacks and Capt. Sisko decides that he and the rest of the landing party will stay and fight along side the other troops. This means Dr Bashir, Ezri and Nog must experience ground combat for the first time and one of them will sustain a serious injury which may effect them for the rest of their life.I found this to be a great episode, normally one feels the main crew will walk away from all situations unscathed but here there is a greater sense of danger. It also lacks a more humorous second story line that many episodes do.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Siege of AR-558 (TV Episode 1998)",Some of the DS9 crew members get their hands dirty.,"This episode of ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" is unusual in several ways. Instead of the usual two plots, there is only one. Additionally, the show is grittier and more violent than usual.There is a Federation base on AR-558--a place that used to be under Dominion control. It's recently been under siege for some time and the Federation troops there are disheartened and beaten up pretty badly. So, when Sisko and some of his folks arrive, they are very welcome. But the task of keeping this base seems impossible, as only about a third of the original troops are alive.An interesting guest star in this one is Billy Mumy, as he was once a regular on ""Lost in Space"" and was a regular on ""Babylon 5"" when he made this guest appearance. Overall, a decent episode, though I did feel their attempt to be grittier still felt amazingly sanitized compared to real warfare. Still, it's worth seeing.",7
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Siege of AR-558 (TV Episode 1998)",A grim Trek episode even by DS9 standards,"PLOT (heavy spoilers!!!)On a routine supply mission the Defiant has to leave after a Dominion attack leaving Sisko, Bashir, Quark, Nog and Ezri in a barren place holding an important Dominion communication's array, defended by a quickly diminishing group of stressed and fatigued Starfleet officers. It becomes clear quickly that these people are on the brink of mental and physical collapse. Quark tries to shield Nog but Sisko sends him on a mission that gravely injures him. Taking heavy casualties Starfleet holds on and finally get relieved by fresh troops. GOOD STUFFFor once this isn't the Enterprise destroying an opposing, heavily armed cough cough warship with one phaser beam or a great battle mentioned in stories. We get right in on the action, and much like Quark points out, these are no longer kind and calm Starfleet officers but weary and hostile animals, looking either for a way out or a kill to make. I love the dark setting, the barren rock that no one will ever hear of, the guest stars who make the most of their material. The action is believable and incredibly violent, at least for Trek, there is a real sense of danger and traumatic fighting. Quark steals many a scene, pointing out humanity isn't so sweet and nice when basic comforts disappear and war is all around; questioning Sisko's decision to send Nog on a mission; questioning whether Sisko even cares for his people; and staying with Nog distracting him. He makes a reasonable point that the Ferengi would choose to negotiate rather than fight an endless battle.I especially like Vargas and Reese. Very different but understandable creatures in a besieged war front. I love the idea of the Dominion using holograms to establish the position and strength of the enemy, and mines in subspace that can go off without any warning.Sisko sometimes becomes so angry he's almost scary. In those moments he's more real, more palpable than any other Captain. Avery Brookes may sometimes be called a Shakesperean robot when he acts out anger but I believed every bit of it.BAD STUFFQuark being send by the Nagus to inspect battle lines seems a pretty shallow way of just getting him involved. Why would Starfleet inundate the Nagus with reports? What the hell are they gonna do? Pay the Dominion to stop their expansionist, genocidal ambitions? The second Bill Mumy asks Ezri to hand him a tool you know they will flirt with or befriend each other. Wouldn't the Houdini mines also injure Jem'Hadar soldiers making them unusable in actual combat? More importantly, if Starfleet recognizes the vast importance of the array when and if their engineers can crack it, shouldn't they send some engineers? Your best engineer is in orbit, hello? Remember the massive advantage the USA had when they cracked the Japanese transmissions. It also seems a bit like a cheap plot device to give the least experienced crew members (Ezri, Nog, even Bashir) their trial by fire in this manner. I can appreciate them becoming better soldiers and proving themselves AND experiencing real warfare, but if the place is under constant attack why not bring Worf, Kira or O'Brien, experienced soldiers? Why not bring tough resistance-trained Bajoran soldiers? Why not send a contingent of tough Klingons? Hell, why not just hire some Nausicans. They love to fight. In the end, Starfleet goofs again by sending another group of inexperienced officers in clean uniforms and dreams of rainbows and sugar, rather than a battalion of battle-hardened super-soldiers. I mean the Federation duked it out with Cardassians, Borg, Klingon and Dominion in recent years, they must have an abundance of veterans.MILITARY PERSPECTIVEI have never been a soldier nor am I a military historian. I am however, feel free to believe or disbelieve me, a historian (University of Amsterdam, class of 2011) and I raise some serious questions on Dominion strategy. We always hear Jem'Hadar are super-soldiers and the Dominion are aces in tactics. Yet despite the ability to cloak soldiers, place subspace mines and bomb cities from the skies they simply just charge in the open and barely take cover. They have phaser-type weapons that they use as clubs. I can understand they won't bomb the structure because they want the array, but I do not understand the total lack of artillery. They found out the positions of the defending force, mull it over, then charge the positions. People, just use an artillery barrage. You can keep the array safe whilst inflicting heavy casualties without risking your own forces. But the 24th century seems to have forgotten artillery and they're proper fools. Give me even a 1860s platoon of soldiers, 3 Gatling-guns and two batteries of artillery and the Dominion will never come close to hand-to-hand combat.CONCLUSIONA very dark and good episode showing Starfleet in a very different light. The military quality of it is somewhat debatable and dubious but the action feels fresh and alive. It fools you into thinking it's a fun episode by having Rom sing as an opener, and then smack you down by getting in the blood and bombs filled theatre of actual war. This is what soldiers experience everywhere and it's hard to stay humane. Quark has some tough but true lessons for Nog and Sisko, our freshest cast get baptized in violence and gore, supporting actors shine, feel very real. It's a great episode that I truly think only DS9 could pull of, already a more dark and bitter show. No nice moral, no sweet ending, no ship ex machina - just real people battling for their very lives. Powerful stuff. 8/10.",8

The show's writers tried hard to get the point across, and for the most part they succeeded. Nog is battle-tested, and I find myself struggling after this episode to still see the obnoxious young Ferengi from season 1. His is a character who has grown immensely, and hopefully Quark has a better understanding of his nephew's desire to live up to the Starfleet standard.
Aside from that, there is battle, and Ezri gets to see if her memories of war have prepared her for what she's going to face. Overall The Siege of AR 558 is a strong episode in what's shaping up to be a very well-written season.",8

At Empok Nor, there is a cult of Bajorans that worship the Pah-Wraiths (beings who are sort of like demons) and their emissary is Dukat!! In this role, Dukat is all smiles, joy, forgiveness and love--which the Colonel knows is a pile of crap since this IS Dukat!! But oddly his followers believe in him completely--as completely as any cult you could find anywhere. Eventually, however, the smooth-talking Dukat ends up creating his own downfall. So how does he handle this? Yep--he arranges for a mass ritual suicide! Can the Colonel possibly stop these idiots from offing their sorry selves and get them to understand that the Pah-Wraiths are NOT the true gods of Bajor and that Dukat is just an opportunistic wiener?I liked this episode a lot--particularly towards the end when Dukat suggests mass suicide! It was very timely in light of the recent mass suicides of the Heaven's Gate cult and it also opens up even more possibilities for Dukat to be a self-serving and evil slug. For more of this sort of nonsense which I love, be sure to watch the series to its conclusion, as Dukat and his insane message gathers a really, really interesting follower!",9
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Covenant (TV Episode 1998)",Gul 'Jim Jones',"This is an okay episode where we get to see Gul Dukat as a cult leader.He kidnaps the now Colonel Kira and wants to bring her into the fold. This is where the plot gets shaky a bit. Dukat has a good thing going, so why on Earth( excuse the pun) would he risk being killed by Kira? Why would Dukat risk Kira unraveling his lies by bringing her aboard Empok Nor? The devout believers were annoying as hell. Dumb and willing to believe anything their emissary says. However it does bring up the point about cults and why they are so effective at keeping control. Jim Jones basically did everything Dukat did and then some, IN REAL LIFE! So I can't fault the episode for portraying some of the dumber sides of humanity accurately. They were just a drag for me.I was so ready to blast this episode with a 6, but the fact that Dukat actually believed parts of his own lies, and prayed to the Pa Wraiths means that it fits into the overall season 6-7 story arc. It isn't JUST a one-off cult episode with no impact on the story. We will hopefully see Dukat psychologically affected by this in future episodes.",7
0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" It's Only a Paper Moon (TV Episode 1998)",This one surprised me with its depth,"""It's Only a Paper Moon"" is an episode that surprised me for two reasons. First, while I never understood why the show used the Vic Fontaine (James Darren) character, here he works fine. Second, I was shocked how good Aron Eisenberg was in this episode as he showed a much greater sense of depth to Nog than we'd ever seen before in the show.When the show begins, Nog has finally returned to the station after losing his leg in battle. While the crew is prepared to celebrate his return, Nog has no interest in this and he quickly departs for the holosuite. He is on medical leave and he plans on spending all of it hanging out with Vic in 1962 Las Vegas. However, over time, it becomes very obvious that Nog is avoiding dealing with his emotional scars and he cannot hide from everyone forever.I was seriously shocked that ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" could deliver a really good show about Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder--especially with a Ferengi going through the trauma. After all, through the course of the show, the Ferengi were mostly there as comic relief and the diminutive Nog isn't most folks' idea of a soldier. Still, due to excellent writing and Eisenberg's performance, it turns out to be one of the best shows of the final season. Well worth seeing.",10
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" It's Only a Paper Moon (TV Episode 1998)",Not all healing is physical,"When I saw that this was going to be another holosuite based episode I was expecting it to be fairly weak as there have been rather too many episodes set there in the various stat Trek series, thankfully this time there were no malfunctions or unexpected dangers just a good character driven episode where the self aware holographic singer Vic Fontaine helps Nog come to terms with the loss of his leg.Having returned from hospital Nog can't come to terms with the loss of his leg and even though the doctors say his new artificial leg is working perfectly he complains that it hurts and insists on walking with a stick. He gets counselling from Ezri but nothing she suggests seems to help; he just lies in his room listening to one of Vic Fontaine's songs. Eventually his neighbour Jake Sisko tells him to turn it off and if he needs to hear it he can go to the holosuite. Nog takes this suggestion literally and goes to the holosuite and after hearing Vic sing many versions of the song asks if he can stay with him. The longer he stays there the less he needs his cane but he also gets to the point where he doesn't wish to leave.Surprisingly this was a good episode and James Darren was great as the occasional character Vic Fontaine the 1960s crooner.

Finally, Nog's friends and shipmates, gently move in and get Vic to agree to help get him squared away.

As Ezri's family run a large mining operation in the area she is asked to see them and ask her mother if her contacts know anything about the chief's whereabouts. It is rather awkward for her as she hasn't been home for several years and a lot has changed for her since she joined with the Dax symbiont. The chief is soon found but by then Ezri has suspicions that lead her to believe that her family may be involved with the Syndicate in some way.While I often enjoy character rather than action driven episodes this one didn't really seem that interesting because Ezri's family wasn't particularly likable, I can see why Ezri left home and joined Star Fleet. There was no action to speak of and when we found out what was going on I didn't really care even though we were clearly meant to be sympathetic to the character concerned.",6

Soon a CONFIDENT and ASSERTIVE Ezri Dax shows up and you know she's from the alternate reality. It seems her friends have captured the Grand Nagus and will kill him unless Quark gives them a cloaking device--which they lack in this alternate universe. Not at all surprisingly, the folks in the alternate universe turn out to be liars and users--and won't honor their agreement. Can Rom and Quark STILL manage to come out on top...and with the Grand Nagus.This alternate reality episode is a bit better than most--which isn't saying a lot.

2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Field of Fire (TV Episode 1999)",Mystery without a mystery,"This is the sort of story I'd have expected on ""Voyager"". It's utterly stale, inane, pointless (BY THE WAY, DID YOU REMEMBER THERE'S A CATACLYSMIC WAR GOING ON BETWEEN THE DOMINION AND THE FEDERATION-ROMULAN ALLIANCE?!) story with a payoff about as satisfying as being punched in the head after being told you have a surprise waiting.So a 22 year old Federation fighter pilot ends up dead on Deep Space Nine with a bullet hole through the heart and no powder residue on him. I'm only guessing this now because this was supposed to an important clue, and yet is never fully clarified until the very end.This leads to Ezri Dax on the case, out to prove how utterly incompetent Starfleet is......except the case is pretty much broken through and the mystery eliminated and left to merely room-searching the 900+ residents of DS9, which would be a whole lot less if the security did their detective work (which to their credit, they did do some of later on), when Bashir and O'Brian discover that the crime was essentially committed using a Federation projectile rifle prototype with a technobabble device that beams the bullet to the location desired of shooting it.Add to that a headset device that essentially acts as the FarSight XR-20 rifle in ""Perfect Dark"" in being able to see through walls perfectly and zoom in even right through people.So Ezri Dax goes through this tedious process of bringing out Joran, one of Dax's previous hosts, and goes through this incredibly boring pale-imitation-ripoff of a Hannibal Lecter-type lecturing of Joran trying to get Ezri inside the mind of a killer.All of which pretty much amounts to absolutely nothing as the final damning clue is established pretty much out of detective skills that would make Robert Goran of Law and Order CI and Sherlock Holmes combined look like child's play, or the Mary Sue inclinations obvious in a bad script---All the victims had pictures in their quarters of themselves and/or family, with people smiling or laughing.Therefore, the killer must be a Vulcan, they establish.Long before you can even begin to put together the logic (HURDURR) behind this assessment, LO AND BEHOLD, A VULCAN ENTERS THE SAME ELEVATOR EZRI AND HER HALLUCINATED-JORAN IS ON! And long before you can laugh it off as a stupid cliché' that MAYBE will be lampshaded, JORAN SAYS HE IS DEFINITELY THE KILLER! So rather than confront him, or get security to search his quarters for his gun, she goes to her own quarters, and uses the FarSight XR-20 to spy on him, catch him looking up her service record, and get HIS OWN FarSight XR-20 to put on. In a scene so blatantly obvious in coming, it has no shock value attached to it at all, they both spot each other pointing the guns at one another, and Ezri's shot hits while his misses her.In order to close the ultimately pointless plot line involving Joran, she confronts his wounded form in his quarters, seemingly about to kill him while Joran urges her on. Instead, she asks why he did it, and he says...""Because logic demanded it"" Any random assortment of words could have been put there that would have made more sense than that. Is this implying that this Vulcan is stupid enough to think of the concept of ""logic"" as some sort of deity, or a universal force like Chi or the Force? Or was there a whole subplot involved about his motivations seeming logical that was completely cut out of the episode that no one cared enough about to fix this loose end? It doesn't even matter anyway. The whole thing was as pointless as an average episode of ""Voyager""",1

Why are there no powder burns? and why is he using a conventional rifle when everybody else uses phasers in the 24th century. While Odo and Chief O'Brien are investigating the technical aspects of the crime Captain Sisko asks ship's counsellor Ezri Dax to provide a profile of the sort of person who might commit such a crime. This causes her some difficulties as it forces her to confront the memories of Dax's former host Joran, a man who had murdered three people in cold blood. As she interacts with Joran she gradually gets into the mindset of the killer, while this enables her to close in on the killer it also brings out more dangerous feeling which she must control.I enjoyed this episode and found it to be one of the more memorable episodes of the series.

This episode has a bad case of amazing-tech-itis. There are plenty of episodes across many sci-fi shows where they get their hands on some amazing tech or knowledge and then conveniently forget about it for the rest of the series. This is one of those episodes.A micro-transporter on the barrel of a gun that fires titanium bullets is already a hard swallow but okay. We do have other evidence of precision transporting in Trek such as when they beam a baby out of the womb in Voyager or when they beam a tiny spy device into a bulkhead in an earlier DS9 episode, etc. But we can't stop there because how is our killer going to see what he's shooting at? I know! Magic X-ray googles!Not only can these magic goggles see through solid matter like bulkheads or people, but they can be zoomed so they DON'T see through objects at a certain distance. If they saw through all matter then surely you'd be looking through the entirety of the station into the blackness of space. So of course we need to be able to zoom the goggles. Is someone standing in front of a monitor you need to look at? Just zoom in through their body and there you go! Now you somehow have a magic invisible floating camera between that person in your way and the monitor in front of them.It's just ridiculous and thankfully they ignore this tech exists in every other part of Trek. If it did exist they'd be as common as phasers and would be used CONSTANTLY. How many plots would be foiled by just one pair of these goggles? What if a ship had this technology on a larger scale and could just peer inside Starfleet Headquarters when they suspect alien corruption and immediately see the nefarious things unfolding there? This plot device tech is just plain horrendous and they should not have thought it was okay to casually introduce it with a bit of technobabble.",3

There are times when we have to sacrifice our true heart's desires in order to keep our relationships going.

Laas is extremely xenophobic and thinks that humanoids are horrible--and that changelings are a far superior life form. He also tries hard to introduce Odo to the notion of leaving the station and going off with him to find more changelings. After all, it MUST suck living among all these humans! Obviously things cannot remain as they are--and the two new friends' time together is destined to be limited.This is a decent episode and it helps illustrate the true character of the changelings--and how Odo is different as well as much like them.

Initially is is assumed he must be one of the Founders but he does not appear to be suffering from the disease that is effecting them and he claims not to have heard of them.Once back on DS9 it soon become clear that he likes humanoids far less than Odo and treats everybody with contempt. Having no time for the locals he tries to persuade Odo to join him in a search for the remaining non-Founder Changelings. Odo is not keen to do this as he wishes to stay on DS9 with Kira.

Things take a turn for the worse when Odo's new friend Laas gets into a confrontation with a couple of Klingons which leaves one of them dead.

5,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Chimera (TV Episode 1999)",I think that this episode is a successful portrait of nowadays' world,"I think the reason why Star Trek was a successful and influential TV series is that it is not just a show full of future technologies like starships or phaser banks, but it is also a thought-provoking one. The argumentations that had been taken in DS9 may be or not be meaningful in 1990s, it certainly is meaningful for us in 2010s. The prejudice acts in this episode, the changeling being assaulted and not trusted, the fear of Odo to perform shape-shifting in public, and the saying that he wouldn't do something, in this case meaning shape-shifting, that would let others feeling not well. As a homosexual boy my mom always told me to keep it to myself that I should not tell others that I'm gay, and by pretending that I am part of the guys who are heterosexual would do me some good. Odo's acts let him gain some friendships with solids, but that won't change the fact that he is a changeling and people just don't like that. I have straight friends but I seldom or do not talk about guys in front of them though they might talk about girls in front of me, and I know by the end that they could accept you as a gay doesn't change the fact that they might be afraid of you.

6,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Chimera (TV Episode 1999)",Masterful,"There are two major themes at play in this episode, or rather, one theme at work in two different ways. People don't have much love for those that are different from themselves. In the Star Trek universe humanity has mostly overcome racism and bigotry, so much so that even different alien species can live and work together. Chimera places the edges of that growth as a culture, as a species, in sharp relief.The central players here are Odo and Kira with the rest of the cast playing one note versions of themselves to help drive the drama. Laas cuts right to the chase as he's too experienced to waste his time. Sisko and the gang are troubled by Laas for reasons they'd rather not face. There is a lot of ""show don't tell"" in the writing with just enough lay it out straight to properly frame the story. How Quark believably became this show's conscience is beyond me, but his role in this episode is pivotal as it saves the regulars from their limited points of view.The other lens to view this episode through is one of self acceptance with undertones, both overt and subtle, of the difficulties faced by those who feel homosexual love. This angle is made even more potent once you realize Odo has unknowingly infected Laas the morphogenic virus he carries. But the episode never feels preachy. The Odo/Laas relationship and Odo's internal conflicts feel genuine and relatable to anyone who feels out of place in this life.We are all prisoners of our own experiences. And yet we all have the potential to be so much more than the sum of our parts. While Odo is torn over who he is and where he belongs, it is Kira that drives the episode's final act. The chemistry between Odo and Kira is never more evident than it is here, and it is that chemistry that really makes this episode work.As much as I love TNG, character's didn't grow and change like this on that show. I could probably snarkily poke holes in this one if I tried but I just don't want to. Chimera is Odo's ""Far Beyond The Stars"" and its everything Star Trek ought to be.",10
7,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Chimera (TV Episode 1999)",The One Where the Writers Try Too Hard,"On the surface, this episode appears to be a competent if not overly exciting examination of Odo's personal issues. Within that context, I could rate this a solid 7. The problem is, the writers were so determined, so laser-focused on the moral of the story that they had to turn every character in the episode into an idiot. We can leave aside (though we shouldn't, I'm just keeping it simple) the fact that all of the Odo issues here have already been thoroughly, and a bit exhaustingly, examined in the arc with the female Changeling on the station during the Dominion takeover. (Y'all remember when Odo's behavior led to tens of thousands of Federation deaths because they felt they had to launch a suicidal desperation attack to save the minefield, and the fact that literally no-one, least of all Kira, ever calls him on the fact that he essentially got tens of thousands of people killed, right?) But let's assume those episodes never happened and DS9 desperately needed to plumb Odo's psyche and his feelings about Changelings and their relationships with the ""solids."" So we have an episode that addresses the issues of bigotry and personal identity and relationships. In order for it to work, the writers needed to:1) Make Odo an idiot. He literally doesn't seem to understand why a being that has expressed overt hostility toward every other lifeform on the station might not be welcomed with open arms. It doesn't occur to him that this same being, after expressing this hostility, after clearly declaring to Odo he wants nothing to do with the humanoids, might have ulterior motives when he went out among them. It doesn't occur to Odo that the being was acting in a deliberately provocative manner, not even when the being can't wait to use the fall-out of the situation to argue that Odo has misjudged them and should leave.2) Make Sisko and other senior officers idiots. They barely touch on the fact that the Changelings are literally trying to destroy them, and have come close to doing so through infiltration. They then leave that issue behind as if it isn't an extremely good reason for having serious reservations about a Changeling that doesn't bother hiding its contempt and loathing for them. They don't bother dwelling too long on that, and prefer arguing jurisdictional issues over the fact that had a humanoid done the same thing to another humanoid then, yes, there would still be an inquest. Their reticence to make this argument clearly perhaps hinges on the fact that, somewhere deep inside, they realize Odo is currently a blithering idiot.3) Make Quark the Voice of the Writers, where he clearly lays down exactly what the writers want the moral of the story to be. It's pompous and obvious, and at no point does anyone provide a more intelligent counterpoint, such as the fact that the other Changeling was deliberately trying to create an incident. No, it must be all about short-sighted primitive genetic heritage. The only reason people accept Odo (the very same Odo who has demonstrated his shape-shifting abilities countless times in front of these people without a single cry of ""WITCH! HANG HIM FOR NOT BEING LIKE US!"") is that he keeps a humanoid form. Makes perfect sense...to an idiot. Luckily for Laas, Odo is currently an idiot.The central tension of this episode was heavy-handed and even more heavily-contrived. What seemed like a harmless standard DS9 episode became a fairly unpleasant insult to the viewers upon close examination. The only time any of the characters behaved in a believable fashion was when Ezri, Miles, Julian, and Kira reacted like they'd just been confronted by a jackass at Quark's, which, of course, they had. One accompanied by an idiot.",4

But it seems that someone along the line in the last two years decided to depart from not only Star Trek way of addressing issues, but the whole role science fiction plays in revealing the modern world to us through metaphor. When Sisco throws his hissy-fit that he won't go in the holo-suite because blacks weren't welcome in Vegas in 1962 - they violate a raft of sci-fi and Star Trek no-no's. First of all, this is the very first time that human racial resentment has been carried into the Star Trek future. Sisco's angry reaction is of someone who has suffered racial bigotry - which is not the case in Rodenberry's future. We've moved beyond it. It makes about as much sense as O'Brien refusing to go with Bashir into his James Bond program because the British oppressed the Irish. Or Bashir refusing to go to the Alamo program because Arabs wouldn't have been accepted in early 19th century Texas. It's idiotic and it violates the truly color-blind approach humanity has reached in the Star Trek universe. Science fiction addresses issues indirectly - like the original Trek's story of the planet that was racially divided by people who had half black/half white faces - but each 'race"" had the colors on the opposites side of the face. Metaphor. Misdirection. That's how science fiction gets it done . . . not by throwing an Al Sharpton rant in the middle of the 24th century. Generally, it's a great episode and a lot of fun. But someone involved with that show insisted on grinding an ax - and accomplished the exact opposite of what they wanted to.",6

A few good examples was one show where the DS9 baseball team played a Vulcan team in the holodeck, a crime detective show featuring Ezri Dax and her alter-ego as well as this show which is a spoof of the old film ""Oceans 11"". Perhaps sticking with the Dominion and Prophets plots would have been wiser in hindsight.Bashir and O'Brien are doing what they love to do--hanging in the holosuite with Vic. However, suddenly something strange happens-- the club where Vic performs is taken over by mobsters AND the crew cannot just delete the mobsters from the program---they need to be more creative. So, they come up with a variation on the film ""Oceans 11"" and a group of crew members help Vic to seal the mobster's money--so that his bosses get mad and kill him. Does this sound the least bit like any of the ""Star Trek"" shows? Nope. And the entire show comes off as very forced and a bit stupid. Easy to skip and, fortunately, the last episode like this in the series.",2

Why he changes his mind and joins the fun is never made clear.While Felix may have failed to accurately capture the racism of the period, he sure got the misogyny right.

They just decided to write an entire episode set in 60s Las Vegas (as if we hadn't seen enough of it already) with more Vic Fontaine singing, and even Sisko singing.What a complete waste of time. It's genuinely not worth watching, and of no relevance to the show at all. If I could have given this episode 0 I would have. It's even worse than the much maligned episode of The Next Generation, Code of Honor.Vic Fontaine was the ""jumping the shark"" moment for Deep Space Nine.

1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Tacking Into the Wind (TV Episode 1999)",Setting It All Up,There are some excellent plot developments. The first among these is Kira being sent behind enemy linces to aid the Cardassians in fighting off the Breen. She must deal with an angry Cardassian who can't assimilate the greater needs. We have Odo contracting the horrible disease that is doing in the Dominion. And there is a need to remove Gowron from head of the Klingon Empire. He is making decisions that will destroy any chance of success.,10
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Tacking Into the Wind (TV Episode 1999)",Wow...some pretty crazy things happen in this one!,"This is one of many episodes towards the end of the run of ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" that make up one gigantic story. Instead of the usual self-contained plot or two-parter, here the show becomes more like a mini-series or soap opera with several plot threads that continue episode after episode.The most bloody and interesting concerns Gowron and his seeming willingness to destroy his fleet. For no apparent reason (other, perhaps than to keep Martok from gaining more fame), Gowron has sent the fleet into several no-win situations. Now, he proposes yet another insane raid--one that will probably get everyone killed. The problem is that Martok is not willing to do what it takes to stop Gowron's madness and so the task is left to Worf. His solution is, to say the least, pretty extreme!As for the Cardassian rebels, Kira, Odo and Garak are out to capture one of the Dominion's ships which has the new Breen weapon. This is because with one shot it can destroy a Federation ship--and they need to get one of the weapons to examine. Finally, with no real success in finding a cure for Odo's illness, the Chief and Dr. Bashir come up with a nutty plan to flush out someone from Section 31 who can give them a cure.This is quite good like other shows in the series. Perhaps it's a tiny bet better since it is bloodier!",9
0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Extreme Measures (TV Episode 1999)",In the mind of a dead man.,"When Dr Bashir informs Star Fleet Medical that he has found a cure for Odo's illness it isn't long till Sloane of section 31 turns up to destroy his work. He is captured but doesn't seem at all concerned as he believes he can withstand any interrogation techniques the doctor and Chief O'Brien might use. When he realises Bashir is about to use illegal Romulan technology to find out what he needs to know he kills himself. Using another device the two are able to enter Sloane's dying mind to look for the cure, the problem is they must find it and get out before he is brain dead or they will die with him and while in there Sloane does everything he can to keep them away from information about Odo's cure and when they find it he will tempt them with further useful information to stop them from leaving in time.I rather enjoyed this episode, while the fact that inside Sloane's mind looked like DS9 was rather cliché it was fun to see that the two Star Fleet officers were willing to break the rules to take on a member of section 31 to save Odo. I was also amused by the scene where Bashir and O'Brien argue about whether the chief likes Julian more than his wife.",8
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Extreme Measures (TV Episode 1999)",The Unfinished Business of Julian and Miles,"Dr. Bashir discovers that Odo's disease was the result of germ warfare started by Starfleet's cloak and dagger organization, Section 31. After weeks of attempts at creating a cure, however, Bashir becomes frustrated as Odo lies dying in the infirmary.Chief O'Brien has a hunch that Section 31 might have a cure for the plague, or at least some research that might advance Bashir's efforts. Miles suggests to his war games buddy that they lure Section 31 to DS9 by having Bashir announce to Starfleet Medical that the good doctor has found a cure for the Plague. Showing that they both have spent too much time in the holo-suites, Julian agrees to the plan, and devises a way to coerce the needed information out of the operative that shows up.Luther Sloan - the only operative of Section 31 that has been identified, at that time, to Star Trek fans - shows up. And he frustrates the hologram warriors by showing that he's not so easily coerced.This is not a stand alone episode. This is episode seven in a nine episode arc that finishes business on DS9. And part of that unfinished business up until now is the unanswered questions in the relationship of Miles and Julian. Even though the episode creates a story time unique to DS9, it relies on what has gone before. Think of it as a necessary aside, or as gamers would say, a solo mission that would need to be completed before the final battle could continue; a.k.a, a snack break.This episode is a gift, and, by far, the best written episode in the final year, IMO. It is a character study that takes all three main characters seriously...so seriously, it hires one of the best character actors of his time, William Sadler, to play one of them, Sloan.This is not the first episode that delved into Bashir's virtual realities; but, whereas one of them, the season four episode ""Our Man Bashir"", tackled Julian's incessant need for escapism; ""Extreme Measures"" shows that he just has plain trouble with reality. There is a scene where a valedictorian Slone, under the influence of Bashir's device, admits that he has been a bad father, a bad husband, and a bad son in his drive to protect his universe from what he believes to be threats. That look on Bashir's face is of pure disgust. How dare his fantasy heroes have to make choices in life? (Garak told Julian that a spy's life was never as fun as his holo-suite choices, and their deeds never as honorable. Obviously, Julian never listened.) We already know that Bashir is a bad date from Leeta and Erzi. And from ""Dr. Bashir, I Presume"" we know he's a bad son. His excuses aren't as noble as Slone's. Julian's medical career comes easy for him. He's a born doctor. He's bad at life because he lives in his escapism. It's something that since episode three, Garak has been telling him to improve. But it's not till now that Julian must come to the realization that maybe he enjoys fantasy more than reality.Even then he hedges his bet. In the virtual world he admits to Miles that he stays too much in the Virtual World because maybe he likes Miles more than the reality that awaits him. But it's an admission made to get Miles to fess up to the same. Don't read too much into that. It isn't intimate. Julian just gets his kicks from controlling VR characters and over-matching his wits with someone who plays with him than he gets from interacting with real people.O'Brian is as obsessed with competitive gaming as Julian is. But in the other areas of life, he is far and above Bashir and Luther. He is a great Dad, a great Husband, a great son, a great coworker, a good soldier?...He elbows his way into the ""Section 31 Game"" because he recognizes that the doctor might be in over his head. The Chief is also confused by the valedictorian Slone, even though that speech sounds similar to final letters soldiers have made up to send to loved ones before a dangerous mission - letters Miles makes up for Keiko all the time.Perhaps the key to the Chief is not that he seeks escapism, but containment; or, better yet, a way for denial. He was once a soldier; and, he pointedly notes on several occasions that is a part of his life he does not talk about. Miles has frequently said that he has no idea how many people he killed during his commission; which makes him the only person on DS9 to not know their death toll. And he thinks the societies that he was warring on should just forget it now that the war is over - that means you Cardassia.It is obvious that O'Brian doesn't want Warriorhood as part of his make-up...even though that's what he did - like it or not - and that's what he's trained to do. I believe to keep this Warrior Miles in a controllable box, he has moved that part of himself to the competitive gaming world. And, fortunately, Julian is a great Virtual Game Master so that the Chief never gets bored.It's easy to spot the Alpha male in this relationship.This has been the most developed storyline in the DS9 years. It started with O'Brian tut-tutting Bashir over his making friends with Garak, escalated into friendly games of racketball; and morphed into Vic Fountaine, Julian's genetic engineering, and Section 31. It has been used as a foreshadowing technique (Remember the Alamo), various subplots, main story lines, and, here, an aside. For fans of the show, this should have been a great payoff.It was for me.",8
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Extreme Measures (TV Episode 1999)",Sloan's Brain,"The idea is a good one. To save Odo, Bashir and O'Brien cook up a plot to lure the 31ers out of hiding, assuming they invented the virus. The problem is that it works and then they have to do something. The solution is to get inside of the networks in Sloan's brain. It is awfully easy for them to do this and to participate. This whole thing is laughable, to say the least. But then, it is Odo!",7
3,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" Extreme Measures (TV Episode 1999)",One of the weaker episodes among the final episodes in the series.,"The final 10-12 episodes of ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" are unusual in that they tell one long story instead of the usual self-contained shows. Of all these shows towards the end, this is my least favorite--and its style is quite different from the rest. Instead of focusing on three or four plots equally, they focus for almost all the show on a bizarro plot involving Dr. Bashir, O'Brien and Sloan of Section 31. The way the show goes is something you may like--I thought it was pretty dumb.When the show begins, Odo is dying and has a great scene with Colonel Kira. The acting (especially by Nana Visitor) is superb and the make-up is amazingly good.The bulk of the show is the Bashir/O'Brien/Sloan plot. Sloan takes the bait offered by Dr. Bashir and arrives on DS9. He is surprised when he is taken prisoner and interrogated. However, being the good spy-guy, he activates a suicide device. Fortunately for the plan, O'Brien and Bashir manage to keep the guy briefly alive so they can crawl inside his head to get the information. This crawling inside is REALLY dumb, as they go on a journey into the consciousness of Sloan and it really made me cringe. Overall, not a terrible episode--but one that could have been done better. Plus, at least you can FINALLY head O'Brien and Bashir profess their love to each other...of sorts.",6

0,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Dogs of War (TV Episode 1999)",Cardassian resistance and Ferengi principles,"This episode follows two main story lines, one involving the fall and rise of the Cardassian resistance which is fairly dark which contrasts nicely with the amusing tale of Quark getting a message from the Grand Nagus telling him that he is standing down and wishes him to take over. When Damar, Kira and Odo attempt to join up with other resistance units they find out they have been betrayed and the group they planned to meet are being killed by the Jem'Hadar, luckily they aren't caught themselves but are forced to go into hiding. While there they see a report stating that all of the resistance leaders including Damar are dead. This gives them the opportunity to prove to the people that he is still alive and fighting by attacking a Jem'Hadar barracks; it might not be a major target but it is enough to show that the dominion lied and encourage to general population to rise up. Realising the war isn't going too well the resident Founder suggests that Dominion forces fall back to their core systems believing the Federation will not continue the fight if the Dominion ceases its attacks. Back on DS9 when Quark gets a message indicating he is to be the next Nagus he is initially pleased, until he learns that the old Nagus has passed a series of unferengi laws which limit the way people can do business and introduce such terrible ideas as taxation and workers rights.The two story lines provided a nice mixture of drama and comedy, Quark's speech at the end is a classic. This episode sets things up nicely for the final confrontation between the Dominion and the alliance of Star Fleet, Klingons and Romulans.",8
1,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Dogs of War (TV Episode 1999)",Forces From Within,"In this next to last episode of the series, I am only interested in the final battle. The Quark thing is truly superfluous and should have been done long ago. Also, the romantic scenes between Bashir and Dax are simply knot tiers. As is he news Sisko gets at the end. I thought the scenes the three rebels were excellent and the overconfidence of the Dominion make for a fun ending. Back in a few minutes for final commentary.",8
2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" The Dogs of War (TV Episode 1999)",I love what happens to Quark in this one....,"Things are looking up in this episode--up for Quark and up for the alliance between the Federation, Klingons and Romulans. But, as I mentioned with several other reviews, it's a bit hard to rate these later episodes because they really are one long story--not the usual self-contained shows.When this show begins, Quark gets a call from the Grand Nagus. It's pretty garbled and fuzzy but the guy tells Quark that he's coming to DS9 to appoint HIM the new Grand Nagus! Naturally Quark is thrilled but soon looses his excitement when he learns several things--one of which is that the constitution has been changed and Ferenginar is now a much more egalitarian and less greedy place...and Quark no longer knows if he even wants the job. There is MUCH more to this plot line but this alone is plenty of reason to see and enjoy this one.As for the war, the Cardassian people are told a lie by their Dominion overlords that Damar is dead. He isn't--and he and his rebels are planning on making that well known. Can they manage to mobilize the Cardassian to rebellion?The rebellion is important because the war has turned decided against the Dominion. They've withdrawn their forces out of Federation, Klingon and Romulan territory but they also are trying to consolidate their forces and take the Cardassians down with them if needed.The show ends on a surprise...Casidy is pregnant. All in all, a LOT happens in this one. It's very satisfying and among the best of the later episodes.",10

Even when I read the book version i couldn't stop myself. The acting in it is so good that I really felt what they were going through as the friends all parted for the final time. The writers did an excellent job and the actors an even better one. The only thing letting it down are the occasional special effects that could do with some work. Cirroc (Jake Sisko) did an excellent job, with the final scene of him looking out into the stars sending me to tears every time. If you have watched any episode of DS9 before you will feel the love oozing off the screen and i just hope you don't come over all girly too. I could undoubtedly watch this episode over and over.

Unluckly I just finished the last episode and now it's over... I must say I am a little sad. It kept me busy after work for a long time and now I miss them all: Captain Sisko, Odo, Bashir, chief O'Brien, Kira, Worf, Jadzia, Jake, Quark, Nog, Rom, Leeta, Garak, Dukat, Martok and above all Ezri (Nicole de Boer is really special). Thank you all. A really good job. The last episode (""What you leave behind"") is the perfect conclusion.

2,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" What You Leave Behind (TV Episode 1999)",The End of an extraordinarily brilliant show,"This is by far my favourite season/show finale of all time. I may have never been as sad and as glad at the same time. Sad, on the one hand, because my favourite TV show finally concluded and was most likely not to be continued (e.g. in a movie), but immensely glad, on the other hand, because they did it well and tied up most of the loose ends.Big spoilers ahead -After 3 seasons with (almost) constant war in it the UFP together with the Klingons, the Romulans, and a little Cardassian help finally defeat the Dominion. Yet, this was no war period but rather an anti-war period. When Admiral Ross and Captain Sisko refuse to drink Martok's Bloodwine over the dead bodies of Cardassians, and in the same way at the signing of the peace treaty on DS9 it really shows two of Gene Roddenberry's major ideals, namely the importance of peace and coexistence. (Whilst some movies are heavily disputed as either war films or anti-war films, I think that Star Trek has never been the former.)-Big, big spoilers ahead...- The characters did get what they deserved. No other season/show finale allowed their protagonists to leave the stage with more grandeur.* Cpt. Sisko - We learn that saving Bajor (..and the Alpha Quadrant..) was only a preliminary for his destination of being with the Prophets.* Odo - He ultimately decides to rest with his people in order to cure them from their previously contracted disease. His parting from Kira was in a way sad but definitely not unhappy or sorrowful.* Cmdr. Worf - The former longtime outcast from the Klingon Empire is offered the position as ambassador on Qo'noS at Martok's side - the man he had helped to become Emperor. A proper fortune for such an interesting character.* Chief O'Brien - Knowing his friendship with Julian will survive the distance to Earth, the Chief accepts a position at Starfleet Academy. And he deserved it. Having worked on the Enterprise D under the command of Picard and having been Chief Engineer on Deep Space Nine this path was inevitable.Of course, they didn't send everyone away from Deep Space Nine (Kira as Station Commander, Julian, Ezri, Jake, Garak and Quark seemingly stay), but these incredibly well written and performed goodbyes really leave you with a comforting feeling. Especially after more than 10 years the toast of Benjamin Sisko is as touching as it is true in my case: To the best crew any captain ever had. This may be the last time we're all together. But no matter what the future holds, no matter how far we travel, a part of us... a very important part will always be here, at Deep Space Nine. ...because a very important part of me will always be at Deep Space Nine, too.",10

After a brilliant seventh season the culmination of all events leading to this unmatched space battle and Sisko's discovery of his fate and his future with the Prophets. I agree, this is heart rending stuff and when all depart for their various new locations I had a big lump in my throat as I'd loved this lot from day one. Killing Damar was a pity as he really came through for Cardassia but I suppose it'd be silly to assume all would live through to the end. Ben Sisko's fortune was a puzzling one. Left wide open to be followed up only never to be..... I hope that the writers will one day chose to keep all fans happy and continue this space epic. Brilliant end to a seriously underrated show. The final scene with Jake Sisko staring wistfully into space at the wormhole was real touching. His relationship with his father was one unlike anything I'd ever seen in any show.",10
4,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" What You Leave Behind (TV Episode 1999)",Greatest Star Trek ending ever,"Clearly free of the influence of Gene Roddenberry since he has died before this was broadcast. This series is far more about spiritual values and allows each of the characters to grow and mature individually. Instead of facing a new and contrived crisis each episode we can see the ongoing relationships among the various characters and frankly one must see more than a single season to see the connections and growth. Because of this the depth of caring we have for the characters is far higher, and this final episode is just overwhelming in its emotional contents.Unlike all the other star Trek series, this one actually comes to a real and genuine close, each character's growth lines, all the various relationships come to a new stage/end. There is no ""going off into the sunset"" cop out ending like all the other Star Trek series and the feeling created in the true fans of this story line is traumatic, ""it's over"" leaving a void where a dear beloved series lived. I also have a tear in my eyes when I view this last episode. I bought the whole series on DVD before Netflix came out and now I have access whenever I want.Others have noted the lack of care about the Voyager series but when one looks in on the final for that series it is a cheat, little emotion except anger over how it is broken and thrown together and probably because the writers/actors just got tired of doing it all.Both the original series and Next generation were the ""going off into the sunset"" ending as if future movies would automatically come for them and pick up their story lines which they did. Not so for Deep Space Nine, the mold was broken and there will be no movies to follow. It is complete, done, Fin and no more needed, sad to lose a friend but OK since we know it could not have been better.",10

The first part shows the final battle and the ultimate defeat of the Dominion then the action moves back to DS9 where the crew get together to celebrate the end of the war and say good bye to friends who are moving on to other assignments, although not all of them wish to say good bye, leading Odo to try to slip off with Kira without being noticed; in a rather touching scene Quark manages to say good bye and show that he will miss his old adversary. Sisko on the other hand doesn't get a chance to say good bye to everybody as when he sets off to the Fire Caves on Bajor he has no idea just what he will have to do to prevent Dukat releasing the Pah Wraths.This was a really great ending to my favourite Star Trek series, it was nice that it took to time to let us see all the main characters one last time and to get an indication what each of them will be doing after the series ended.

However, be forewarned--it is an emotional roller-coaster and you may just want to have some Kleenex handy. I loved 99% of the show, though as usual, while I loved James Darren's acting and singing, it did leave me wondering WHY he was on the show in the first place!! Overall, extremely well written, very exciting and just about everything fans could want in a finale--hence this explains why this final episode was the length of two normal episodes.",10
7,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" What You Leave Behind (TV Episode 1999)",A great finale - up until the sorcerers and mount Doom,"The ending to the Dominion war, which makes up the bulk of this 2-part series finale, is excellent - from the Cardassian rise up (nice to portray them positively in the end) to the final battles, it was a very satisfying conclusion to the main storyline. The final departures of characters, with Worf becoming an ambassador, Odo returning to his people and O'Brien going back to Earth, were also bittersweet, and it felt like saying goodbye to good friends.The only part that didn't work well in this final episode was the same part that had been going wrong for a very long time now, and it is the Prophets / Bajor storyline. Here at the end, we continue to have the most iconic science fiction franchise shoot its own leg with what transcends the - albeit blurry - borders of trekobabble and goes straight into magic. Godlike aliens like the prophets were nothing new in the Star Trek universe, but their evil enemies called Pa-wraiths spelled trouble from the start - culminating to a plot where they are released from a cave through a magical incantation found in a forbidden tome (which released its secrets after spilling blood on it), and possess Gul Dukat. Sisko pulls a Gollum, jumps with him in the raging fires and....well, clearly, the magic book burned, so the evil wraiths were banished back to hell, and Sisko was saved by the prophets and trasnferred to the wormhole. It is a sad and nonsensical affair, but not enough to take away from the main story. However, it is a total waste of what was, along with Garak, the most interesting recurring character of the show. Gul Dukat was a fascinating character as a narcissistic war criminal, with lots of layers to his portrayal. This last season's transformation into a possessed Satanist made the last confrontation with him anticlimactic.",8
8,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" What You Leave Behind (TV Episode 1999)","Good acting, but the whole DS9 storyline sorta sucks","By that, I mean the entire plot about gods and prophets. Too many cases of *Deus ex machina* pop up in this series. Star Trek has always been about humans evolving beyond the severe limitations of religious belief. TOS dealt with this often: the Apollo they meet on their voyage was a member of an alien race that once visited Earth and helped kickstart civilization. The Metrons and Organians, who had evolved beyond the need for corporeal existence and existed as pure mind energy. TOS recognized them as evolved alien races that may have appeared to have been gods, but were just more advanced.DS9 turns it all on its head. Prophets and gods return with their deity to the fore, the Bejorans are obsessed with these supernaturals who exercise power over them. Miracles happen, like when the Dominion forces are destroyed in the wormhole when facing down a lone starship. Yeah, it's the big flaw in this ""spiritual"" series.",
9,"""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" What You Leave Behind (TV Episode 1999)",The last episode is like artificial flavoring,"Like artificial flavoring, it has good elements but leaves an unpleasant aftertaste. The change in direction toward the beliefs in the prophets in last season or so was weak. It went from using the beliefs as allegories for challenging blind faith and so on to a level of supernaturalism which seemed like promotion for the methods of belief which were criticized in earlier seasons. And the whole ""the book was the key"" idea was trashy. On top of the excessive hocus pocus elements, the last episode had way too many deus ex machina moments. Even the Founders' leaders positive transformation seemed to be a cheap way to end a story arc which stretched across seasons.It least it did not involve a hokey time travel finish like other series.

But this is really as much fantasy as science fiction (the business with the prophets and their magical qualities). But the bad thing about a loooooooong final episode is that everything needs closure. At least some of the characters are staying behind and continuing their lives on the station.

I literally had to force myself to watch the last 30 minutes of this tiresome, self-indulgent episode, because I'd watched the rest of the Dominion War arc and didn't want to leave the last hurdle uncleared. This episode was so bad it made the last TOS episode, Turnabout Intruder, look like a landmark television masterpiece. Very difficult to determine what was the worst aspect to the episode: was it the sappy Kira/Odo ending, the embarrassing O'Brien/Bashir bromance, the endless cliffhanger BS with Kai Winn and Dukat, the schmaltzy last night at Vic's, or the totally disappointing end to the war with the Dominion. Finales are often a letdown, and I was never a huge fan of DS9 in general, so my expectations were not sky high, but really this was mawkish, dreadful muck. The only worthy moments were with Garrick and the last of the Weyouns. I thought Garrick's realization that he was back on a devastated Cardassia was a fitting reminder of the cost of war and his malicious glee in having killed the last of the Weyouns (""I was hoping you would say that"") could not rescue this awful episode. It could have been 15 or at most 20 minutes long, and one wouldn't have missed anything worth watching. Having watched the Dominion War episodes, and especially this contemptible loser, will insure that I won't bother with the rest of the series.",1
