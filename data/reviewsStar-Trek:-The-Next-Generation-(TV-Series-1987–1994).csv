0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent: Part II (TV Episode 1993)",Brothers and emotions.,"ST:TNG:153 - ""Descent, Part II"" (Stardate: 47025.4) - this is the 1st episode of the 7th and last season of Star Trek: The Next Generation.As the episode opens, it is revealed that Lore (Data's evil brother) is behind the attacks and the unification of the self-aware Borg, and also responsible for giving Data his negative addictive emotions (via the emotion chip from ""Brothers"" that Dr. Soong created for Data), thereby making him loyal to Lore. They have captured Picard, Troi, and Geordi, while Dr. Crusher remains in command of the Enterprise (facing her own challenges). And, Riker and Worf (still on the planet with 45 others) soon encounter another group of self-aware Borg lead by Hugh (again played by ""I, Borg"" Jonathan Del Arco).Find out what happens in this exciting ""Descent"" conclusion episode. Only real complaint is that Hugh doesn't meet Geordi (his ""friend"" from ""I, Borg"") in this episode, which I found disappointing.Trivia note: Dr. Crusher uses the metaphasic shielding she learned about in the 6th season episode ""Suspicions"" to outrun the Borg. The emotion chip seen in this episode will reach its conclusion a year later in Star Trek: Generations. We see Spot again too.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent: Part II (TV Episode 1993)",The Lost Boys,"By the time I began watching TNG, the seventh season was already in progress. Still to this day, I am a TOS Star Trek guy and I didn't want to even experience the second show. As a teenager, my parents started watching it and I caught most of the show. This was one that I missed for some reason.After the show went off the air, a writer from Entertainment Weekly wrote about each episode of the show, ranking them in order. This was one of the lower ranked episodes and possibly the lowest ranked two part episode. This was due mainly to the treatment of the Borg. The once ultra cool cyborgs which to this day are still the most formidable foe of the Federation (I used the alliteration on purpose)were used so poorly. He referred to them as ""the lost boys"" of the galaxy, and the Peter Pan reference was accurate. The show never really makes clear what happened. Hugh explains that the Borg were of one mind and his individuality messed that up. This makes no sense whatsoever. If the Borg are incapable of taking away individuality and placing that mind into the collective, then the Borg cannot exist. Simply what they have been doing forever cannot be done with one Borg drone? And the argument that it couldn't be done with Hugh because he is already a Borg is not valid either. They took the simplest thing the Borg are capable of doing and made them incapable of doing it. It was asinine. Beyond that, the episode seems to imply that this was an effect that affected the entire collective. It also implies that it was only these Borg. This sets off a chain of events that makes the Borg harder to understand. We start learning that the Borg ships individually are collectives not linked to the whole. Then we are told all ships are linked to the whole. It gets confusing, and it started with this sub average episode.But even putting the Borg to the side. This episode is disturbing for the experiments that Data puts his friends through. Lore has all the compassion of the Jigsaw killer an making Data do it was sickening. I doubt I'll ever watch this again.",5
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent: Part II (TV Episode 1993)",Lore is evil and obnoxious...and he does it with a twinkle in his eye.,"This is the second part of a two-part series--ending season six and beginning season seven. In the first part, the Borg attack the Enterprise. But it's not THE Borg but an odd offshoot. Oddly, at the end of this episode, they learn that Lore, Data's evil twin, is behind it all--and he takes several of the crew prisoner.This second part has two main plots. With lots of the crew on the planet looking for Lore and the Borg, Dr. Crusher is in command and must contend with the Borg and rescuing the crew--no small feat. The main plot involves Data, who is under some sort of mind control by Lore. Can Geordi and the other prisoners manage to break through Data's new programming to get him to refuse to do Lore's evil bidding?All in all, this is a very exciting finale--and I almost always love these two-parters because there's so much action and mayhem! Well worth seeing--especially since Lore is so wonderfully bad!",9
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent: Part II (TV Episode 1993)","Metaphasic Shielding, Captain Crusher and Ensign Taitt","This episode is a great piece of evidence that in Trek, there are hardly any ""throw away"" gadgets or gimmicks. Already we are revisiting ""I, Borg"" and ""Brothers"" and in this finale, also season 6's ""Suspicions"".Picard, Geordi and Troi are captured by Lore and Data - Data is NOT himself. His Ethical Subprogram, the one thing that makes him different than Lore, has been shut off. Crosus (Brian Cousins) shut it off in the last episode. In fact Crosus is Lore's number one Crony. Meanwhile, away teams are out on the surface, and Worf and Riker while trying to track Picard's whereabouts, find Hugh's secret lair- So we see that Hugh may have been the catalyst for this new state of Borg Individuality, but he did not exploit it - That in fact was Lore.But ""Captain Crusher"" is on command of the Bridge - And is attacked by the huge Borg Monstrosity-Ship while the away teams are planet-side.With about a minute to beam everyone up, they get all but about ""47"" crew-members who are on the planet before she is chased off by the huge Borg Non-Cube ship - She traverses the Trans-Warp Conduit and sends out a beacon, then goes back to try to get those 47 crewmen.And this is where we meet Ensign Taitt (the gorgeous Alex Datcher) - Low Ensign on the Totem Pole, Crusher keeps her handy on the Bridge and this is good for her, and us as well. James Horan, who was the evil Jo'Bril in ""Suspicions"" shows up as ""Lieutenant Barnaby"" - And this is a mix for some great Bridge Interaction.Down below, Data begins to torture Geordi, who had seen with his VISOR that Lore is in fact controlling him. Lore orders Data to take the VISOR away. Riker and Worf confront Hugh - Hugh gives us the history behind this change in the Borg, but he will not help Riker and he still blames The Enterprise and crew for what had happened to them. But he does show Riker how to get into the main complex.Meanwhile Crusher goes back to the planet, on the opposite side of where the Borg ""Winchester Mystery House in Space"" is, and is able to beam up all but Riker and Worf and Picard's party - So, with nowhere to run heads for the SUN. Because she has a plan.She uses the Metaphasic Shielding tech left over from ""Suspicions"" to enter the stars Corona, and stays there, while the Borg ship waits.Picard with Geordi's help is able to reboot Data's Ethical Subroutine, it's a guess when and if it worked. In fact it works right away, while Riker, Worf and Hugh (who had changed his mind) get into the main Borg- Palais.Ensign Taitt has a way to get the Sun to Flare Up - As Worf's brother Kurn had done with his warp drive in Redemption Part II - And is seen again in Deep Space Nine, Season 7, Episode 2, Worf uses the same technique to blow up some Jem'Hadar Shipyards. This is also where Ensign Taitt and Lt Barnaby have some great discussions.Despite this treatment of The Borg, many of the other aspects of this episode were central for some of the best episodes of Next Generation and Deep Space Nine. And the Data/Lore storyline is finally given an ending. We are left with the impression, despite all he had done, Lore really did finally have love for Data. Data still cannot share this, but Lore had the emotion chip - And Data will not have it until ""Generations"". And my favourite part of this episode is as Lore is deactivated, his eyes cloud over and we can see the life going away.So we see here that Lore, not having Data on hand to share the emotion chip with, was using it to influence The Borg, who were at least halfway ""artificial"" - It also explains why Lore had sent Crosus to get Data. Lore was trying to make The Borg as totally electronic as he was, we saw the destroyed Borg Drones he had experimented on.And I think, this is a hard story to swallow, not because of the native change in the Borg, not that the Borg had been destroyed - We know from this episode that the rest of the Borg Collective had not been affected by Hugh. Some of this was explored in Voyager. But the juggling of Data/Lore/Borg and Metaphasic Shielding, perhaps was too much stuff for the average fan to digest. But as I revisit these two episodes, the more I enjoy them, the more connections I find in them. And I always loved the Lore episodes, where Brent Spiner plays against himself.My Only Regret is that ""Hugh"" - Jonathan Del'Arco - Did not have a reunion with Geordi, there was simply no time for it, maybe something was filmed, but it was impossible to fit it in to this story. So I have to believe Geordi would not have left before talking to Hugh, and I imagine that the two had a discussion before parting- It's just Offscreen.",10
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent: Part II (TV Episode 1993)",The worst plot devices all crammed into a single two part episode,"The writers resort to 2 dimensional comic book characterizations, 19th century plot devices and lapses in logic in this 2 part episode.Lore is a smirking ""Eevyil Genius"" with a master plan for elimination of inferior beings and Universal Domination. He has set up silly structure with vaguely fascists looking symbolic elements where a few Borg have become his minions (meaning, of course, they are cannon fodder who can only hit non recurring characters in hand to hand combat, are hard to kill when it isn't important, but extremely vulnerable when being killed moves the plot along.We know all of this, because, instead of doing what bad critters really do, and just doing their evil deeds, Lore must tell his victims exactly what his plans are, and, also, provide sufficient scenarios in which his victims can concoct escape plans. This results in several 1960s style expositional scenes in which Lore almost produces a ""Mha-mha- mha, victory is mine"".The Borg guards fall for a ""Captain isn't feeling well"" get out of force field ruse because, of course, they have deep wells of empathy for humans. The day is saved by a ""get in touch with your better self"" speech in which Data is reminded who his true friends are (with a touch of technobabble and deus ex machina technology to help things along.)In the end, we have a suitably melancholy ending, with just the right amount of hope, as Data chooses to give up emotion so that he doesn't become a monster, but his one true friend, Geordi, intimates that, maybe, in the future he will be ready.Hugh the Borg is told to look into himself and find leadership qualities, because all things touched by the Enterprise become ""the most important thing of their kind in the Universe.""All in all, writing out of our naive past, without the cheesy charm of brilliant hammy actors.",3
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent: Part II (TV Episode 1993)",The Descent of our opinion of Data,"Brent Spiner stated that playing Lore was much easier for him than playing Data because he is much more similar to Lore. When you watch this show and previous episodes in which Lore was featured, that statement should scare the hell out of you. Yet if you've interacted with the man at a sci fi convention or read about other people's interactions with him then you know that the statement is accurate. He is a good actor and a creepy human being.This episode is a bit of a mess. As other people have remarked here, everything seemed to be wrapped up a bit too tidily. Data, who seemed quite psychopathic in most of the first episode and until the final few minutes of this episode, suddenly realizes that maybe doing Nazi-like experiments on his friends is bad because.... ummm, the episode's runtime is almost over, I guess.Data's personality in this two-part set is extremely disturbing. It taints whatever goodwill we had for his character. When he receives mild doses of feelings from Lore his reaction is to kill or torture to continue to receive more doses. If you believe that Lore is stripping his autonomy from him by this method, you are let down when you see him beg for more of it when he begins to return to a robotic mindset. I also remember that when his emotion chip was active in the movies he seemed like a cowering imbecile. In other words, when Data is left to his own devices, he seems unlikeable and maybe even abhorrent.I enjoyed the return of Hugh, yet as other people have noted here, his story about how his newfound autonomy almost destroyed the Borg was confusing.This show's good acting is almost ruined by writers who didn't seem to know what they were doing-- writers who caused us to question our fandom for Data.",4
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent: Part II (TV Episode 1993)",Data turns 'evil' and Beverley flies into a sun,"At the end of the previous episode we saw Picard, Geordi and Troi surrounded by rogue Borg as Data's brother Lore tells them that he and Data will destroy the Federation. They are taken into custody and Data takes their communicators and Geordi's visor. They then start speculating how Lore may have persuaded Data to turn on his colleagues. It is determined that he gave Data negative emotions and somehow disabled his ethical subroutines to 'cure' him they will have to find a way to restart these subroutines. Meanwhile the Borg ship returns and Riker orders Dr. Crusher to beam up as many of the away teams as possible then return to Federation space via the sub-space conduit. She returns to the conduit but doesn't enter; instead she sends a message buoy before returning to beam up more people. The Borg ship attacks and she orders the navigator to take the Enterprise into the sun using the shield modifications that were first introduced in the episode 'Suspicions'. Riker and Worf meet a familiar Borg, who has not been seduced by Lore's ideas, and attempt to rescue Picard and the others.This episode provides an exciting conclusion to a two part story and a great start to season Seven. The big question at the end of the last episode was 'how could the ever-reliable Data turn on his friends?' and here we learn just how Lore engineered it for him to be given certain negative emotions before over-riding his ethical subroutines. Having Data acting out of character and his 'evil' brother Lore appear in the episode gives Brent Spiner chance to be a little less restrained which is a lot of fun to watch. This episode also sees Gates McFadden take her character into a more interesting direction as Dr Crusher is left in charge of the ship and has to make decisions that could have life or death implications for all on board rather than just one patient. The story is exciting with plenty of tense moments; most notable as Data performs potentially fatal experiments on Geordi. It was nice to see how this story referred back to events in previous episodes. Overall a great start to the seventh of final season of TNG.",9
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent: Part II (TV Episode 1993)",Overcoming Your Programming,"There are two issues at work here. The future of the Borg (disconnected) and the futures of Data and Lore. Data has been neutralized and a chip producing negative emotions installed. He has hooked up with Dr. Soon's miscreant throwaway child, Lore, who has become a threat to the Universe by engaging independent Borg (the product of Hugh's leaving the hive). This is mostly about Data and his ability to function (not unlike the Borg with his analytical side butting up against the good side). The problem for Lore is that he is unprincipled and evil and has no redeeming qualities. He destroys everything in his path for power, and because he is so transparent, he alienates those he must enlist in his schemes. Data begins to see the illogic of these actions, and while he longs to experience emotions again and to advance his humanity, there are things within him that block the pathways. Simply stated, he is only partially sure of things and that becomes a dilemma for him. This is a neat episode, even if one is concerned only with the fate of the crew members and Captain PIcard.",9
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent: Part II (TV Episode 1993)",The sons of Soong have joined together,"Picks up rather nicely from the cliffhanger with everyone separated, Beverly at the conn and Data corrupted by a sociopathic brother. But Lore was easily my least favorite aspect. This episode got much more mileage out of Beverly onboard the fleeing Enterprise, skeleton crew and hiding from the Borg ship (in the Sun!). These scenes had all of the story's energy and tension.7/10",7
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent: Part II (TV Episode 1993)",I'd rather watch a Sons of Soong spin-off series,"So let me get this straight. The Borg perpetuate themselves by assimilating individuals into their collective. But when they assimilate Hugh back into the collective his individuality causes a catastrophic systems failure? Their entire existence is based on the assimilation of individuality, but if a Borg regains individuality and then is assimilated a second time his individuality cannot be processed? Okay that checks out.The enterprise has a complement of over 1000 people. Let's be generous and assume the skeleton crew aboard the enterpriser consists of 200 people and that another 200 aren't officers (family of officers, children, ect.). That's 600 people on the planet. After 50 seconds of beaming there are 73 people left on the planet. After 15 more seconds there are only 47 people left. Working backwards that's 26 people every 15 seconds which means about 87 people were beamed off the surface during the preceding 50 seconds for a grand total of 113 people pulled off the surface. Plus the 47 left on the surface that's 160 people that were looking for Data and a skeleton crew of 840 left on board the enterprise. Okay good that checks out too.Lore and Data want to create a race of purely artificial life forms by cobbling together a visor with Borg technology. Oh wait, its because Geordi can see the carrier wave Lore is using to manipulate Data. Got it.Hey look, there's a chair on the bridge, not the first time I've seen one of those, where are they stored? The Borg ship is massive and unaffected by the Enterprises weapons. The Borg's weapons can knock out warp drive while the shields are up. No special generators are needed for metaphasic shielding, just a computer program. Got it; checks out.Other thoughts:Crusher, Tate, and Barneby's efforts to battle the Borg ship are by far the best part of this episode.Its nice to see Hugh again. I really like I Borg, but I didn't want or need a follow up. Now that there is a fledgling colony of independent Borg on a remote planet a follow up does seem appropriate, but it never comes.Finally, I wish I wish I wish Geordi didn't stop data from destroying the emotion chip as this episode is directly responsible for the Data we get in Generations and that Data is the absolute worst.I want a spin-off series featuring ensign Tate. I imagine she can get any posting she wants with ""destroyed a Borg ship"" on her service record.Verdict: Semi-enjoyable, mostly forgettable, bad for canon.Fun facts:47 People were left behind after the Borg ship attacks.The words bouye and buoyancy occur with alarming frequency. Well 3 times but still.The Sons of Soong is (or was) a band working and recording in Oakland county Michigan. They released an album called ""Stillborn and Afterbirth"". I know this sons made up but I assure you it is not. Google it.",4

In that episode, a rival scientist hi-jacks a shuttle that has the modified shields and Dr Crusher on-board. This scientist, Dr. Jo'Brill, is played by James Horan. In this episode of Decent, James Horan plays a Lt.

Cmdr. Data.",8
11,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent: Part II (TV Episode 1993)",strange new odds..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.
Season 07The seventh act of the series seemed like an overstretched material where the writers were clearly running out of ideas, although to balance it properly, there are few brilliant concepts that defines the ingenious of Star Trek.Descent Part IIThis is basically one big rescue mission, where the rest of the crew sneak in smoothly while the Picard group mingle with each other trying to figure out how to blast their way out of the doors, a disappointing one, considering the previous half.",
0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Liaisons (TV Episode 1993)",Different methodology.,"ST:TNG:154 - ""Liaisons"" (Stardate: Unknown) - this is the 2nd episode of the 7th and last season of Star Trek: The Next Generation.The Enterprise welcomes Iyaaran ambassadors as part of a cultural exchange with this new race. While Troi gets an ambassador that loves food (especially dessert), Worf (who doesn't want to be an ambassador) gets one that's rude and selfish (getting on Worf's nerves). Meanwhile, Picard and a pilot are en route to their planet to meet the ambassador there but are forced to crash land on a desolate planet. With the pilot killed and Picard knocked unconscious, he is rescued by a woman named Anna who has been on this planet by herself for 7 years.But Picard soon suspects that Anna isn't who she seems, and neither are the ambassadors onboard the Enterprise.Trivia note: Troi's love of desserts is shown here - especially chocolate (including a chocolate puff with 17 varieties of chocolate in it)! Also, Anna crashed landed 7 years ago (an homage I think to the fact this is the 7th season). And, we see another one of the crew's poker games.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Liaisons (TV Episode 1993)",Unusual ambassadors,"This episode sees the Enterprise hosting two Ilarian ambassadors as Picard travels to their home world with a third. Things get off to an awkward start when one of them, who was meant to be looked after by Riker, insists that he must be looked after by Worf. From then on he is consistently rude; it is almost as if he is deliberately goading Worf. The ambassador assigned to Troi couldn't be more different; he is friendly and keen to enjoy himself; especially when he discovers the delights of chocolate. Picard meanwhile has greater problems; the shuttle he is travelling in hits a spacial anomaly and crash lands on a remote planet. The Ilarian is seriously injured so Picard goes to seek help. He is caught in a plasma storm and rendered unconscious. When he wakes up he finds he has been moved to crashed cargo transporter by a woman who says she has been alone on the planet for seven years. She informs him that she went to the shuttle and found the Ilarian dead. He is determined to find a way to contact help but while she claims to be keen to escape the planet her actions suggest otherwise then she starts hitting on Picard; claiming to be in love with him!After a dramatic season opener this is more of an 'alien of the week' episode; that doesn't mean it isn't fun though. Of the two ambassadors on the Enterprise the one who is with Worf provides most of the entertainment; his belligerence and rudeness look sure to start a fight and when they finally do his reaction is priceless, we also have an hilarious moment when Data points out that all these negative traits mean he and Worf have a lot in common. The story on the planet is intriguing although I'm sure most viewers will get an inkling that the woman isn't what she claims to be long before Picard learns the truth. When we finally learn the reasons behind what we have seen it makes sense within the context of an alien race making contact with a new society. Overall this might not be a classic but it is still a decent episode with a good mix of drama and humour.",7
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Liaisons (TV Episode 1993)","Worf, chocolate and a lady much like Kathy Bates in ""Misery""...","While ""Liasons"" is a pretty good episode, I should also point out that the problems that the Enterprise crew have with the Ilarians are EASY to figure out...and it makes no sense that it takes everyone so long to figure out what's happening! This is a serious weakness in an otherwise decent plot.When the Ilarian ambassadors enter the ship, one of the ambassadors requests that Worf escort him around instead of Riker. The other is escorted by Troi and he spends most of the show eating EVERYTHING that is edible. Later, Picard is stranded on a planet and is discovered by a screwy lady who is HIGHLY reminiscent of Kathy Batesin ""Misery"". What do these three things have in common? See the show.As I said, the idea in of the Ilarians is novel and interesting. I just wished it had been handled a tad differently--making it all a bit less obvious.",7
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Liaisons (TV Episode 1993)","This episode is funny, in a Star Trek sort of way","Worf and Riker bro down while they put on dresses. Riker gets all SJW on Worf before complementing him. They meet up with Picard and Troi. Troi is wearing a dress too, but Picard just has on a snazzy jacket. They meet up with three aliens and then go to 10 forward for a party. Except for Picard, he and one of the aliens go for a bromantic shuttle ride.Everyone at the party in 10 forward has a grand old time except for Worf who gets to play waiter for his alien companion. Data makes small talk with Worf and its pretty funny, in a Star Trek sort of way.Meanwhile on the shuttle, Picard and his alien brodie are having an awkward moment when the power suddenly fails and they have to crash land on a desolate planet. Communications are out and Pircard's brodie is hurt so Picard goes outside to look for help. Its noteworthy how many breathable atmospheres there are in the Star Trek universe. He's hit by a plasma discharge and rescued by a stranger.Back on the Enterprise Worf is playing nice with his new frienemy (Geordi is too modest, I'd have said yes because its so obviously true). Troi is out and about with her new alien bestie who's never seen a child before. They make a new friend and then go get desert. Its funny, in a Star Trek sort of way.On the planet Picard awakens to find himself injured and alone with a mysterious women named Ana. She tells him that his Brodie is dead and then leaves the room for what I assume was a commercial break. Turns out she's been stranded herself for 7 years (since stardate 40812). Not to worry though, she's off to the shuttle to get a communications device.On the Enterprise Worf is plotting a murder. Riker and Troi are quite pleased with his frustrations. Its actually pretty funny, in a Star Trek sort of way. They plan to play a game of poker.Meanwhile Picard's new boo has destroyed the communications device with a phaser. She expresses her hopelessness, mulls over suicide, and confesses her love for Picard in an effort to get into his pants. Then she makes him dinner and starts forcing the issue while he works on a way off the planet. Its a little awkward.Worf is still bad at poker. Not only does he lack a poker face but he keeps his chips in front of another player. The ensuing conflict is completely predictable and somewhat funny, in a Star Trek sort of way.Hooray, Picard has MacGyvered a way off the planet but his savior would rather stay and bang him out. Her desperation is palpable. No means no Ana, no means no.Spoiler spoiler plot exposition spoiler.Picard and his brodie head back to the Enterprise where Worf and his new bestie have been fighting in the holodeck. Homeostasis is restored and the credits roll.Over all this episode is pretty good as a one off, but its not very memorable.
Every time I rewatch TNG I forget all about this episode until it rolls around. And then I end up enjoying the B-story on the Enterprise much more than the A-story on the planet. Its not badly written by any means, its just not quite to my taste.Verdict: Funny, in a Star Trek sort of way.",7
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Liaisons (TV Episode 1993)",Star Trek: The Next Generation - Liaisons,"Iyaarans are new to the Federation (and the ways of officers and how they function emotionally/behaviorally), and so a ""cultural exchange"" takes place so that ""diplomatic relations"" could commence between the two parties. One of the Iyaarans seems to purposely instigate Worf's resolve, asking him to do menial deeds for him and constantly cutting him off, using belittling tactics to incite/goad him to anger. The other is introduced to desserts by Troi, and his appetites become insatiable. Picard takes a shuttle with the third Iyaaran, but the dialogue between them is rough at best. When the shuttlecraft hits an ""energy discharge"" during their journey, crashlanding on a planet with constant ""plasma interference"", Picard and the Iyaaran are hurt. The crash supposedly kills the Iyaaran while Picard strays from the shuttlecraft to search for medical assistance, hit by a ""plasma charge"" (basically a lightning bolt) and injured. He is pulled away by a woman named Anna, for whom he awakens to. She proves to be an obsessive captor needing Picard to love her! She even accosts him with kisses and appeals for his love in one strange scene as Picard has to force her off of his person! Told he has broken ribs and that the Iyaaran is dead, Picard recuperates and soon learns that Anna is not who she says. She tells him she has spent seven years on the uninhabited planet and that thoughts of leaping from a precipice to her doom have crept in her heart at moments. When her love isn't shared and Picard ""calls her bluff"" on jumping (a necklace is a clue), he soon discovers something the Iyaarans have been needing to understand is the reason he's on the godforsaken planet. Human emotion (well, not just human, just concepts like love, antagonism, and the joy of ""bad food"") intrigues the Iyaarans so they want to get as much understanding of it as possible. Okay episode is more amusing than anything else, a tiny blip within the long-running series, ""Liaisons"" won't be confused with Yesterday's Enterprise or Relics, but it has its entertainment value. If anything seeing Worf uncomfortably stuck in a diplomatic role has its comic value, and seeing the Iyaaran rise up after being physically assaulted by Worf thanking the Klingon for enlightening him on the use of violence on the receiving end of antagonism is a hoot! Troi getting tired of chocolate after her Iyaaran has been feeding himself silly over the course of his stay is also quite funny.

Each has an interesting being about him. One is gregarious, attracted to Troi and food. He gorges himself and acts as a glutton for pleasure. The second is a hostile, confrontational bully, who chooses Worf to attend to him and then abuses his powers (obviously, Worf can do nothing because these are their guests). The third goes on a mission with Picard on a shuttlecraft. He barely speaks to Picard, seeming to be quite annoyed at being with him. A malfunction in the shuttlecraft sends them to a planet that has intense storms. They are trapped and Picard, leaving his ""friend"" behind (he was badly injured in the crash) tries a bit of reconnaissance but is hit by a bolt from the sky. He is rescued by an attractive young woman who takes him with her to her hiding place. She nurses him, but keeps him locked up. I think that if there is a bit of a weakness in the verisimilitude in this series, it has to do with shape changing and out and out magical abilities of the aliens.

When Picard assigns Geordi to use an experimental interface unit to rescue a science vessel that's trapped inside the atmosphere of a gas giant, Geordi learns that the starship Hera commanded by his mother, Silva La Forge (played by Madge Sinclair) has disappeared and is presumed that all is dead.However, when he goes back into the science ship with his interface, he comes face to face with his mother, who is alive.Also guest starring Ben Vereen as Geordi's father, Commander Edward M. LaForge, M.D.Trivia note: the Excelsior is mentioned as one of the rescue ships. Madge Sinclair also played the Saratoga captain in Star Trek IV (the first female starship captain shown in Star Trek). We see Geordi get angry for one of the very few times in the series.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Interface (TV Episode 1993)",Kind of an Empty Episode,"I think of all the characters aboard the Enterprise, the least interesting, to me, is Geordi LaForge. There doesn't seem to be a depth to his character. He is a repository of technological knowledge. He frequently pulls stuff out of the blue that is so advanced it bears a bit of skepticism. That doesn't mean I dislike him but he isn't very interesting. They play on his inability to form relationships, but he never gets out of his head. He is dull. This episode, which involves the death of his mother, has him going off half cocked and not recognizing clues that his experiences should have taught him. When his mother shows up, he should have had some suspicions about who she was. He ignore the advice of the crew. Granted he has lost his mother, but her appearance is in the oddest circumstance. I just couldn't get into this one.",6
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Interface (TV Episode 1993)",One needs Cliffnotes to follow this story.,"In this episode that needs to come with operating instructions, Geordi has been hooked up to some machine that is known as Interface. It seems that Geordi, due to his hyper-sensitive viewing operation, can see things in the machine that other are unable to see. Geordi can actually visualize things, in real time, all while hooked up to this machine located on the Enterprise.After Geordi is told that his mother, a Captain on another star ship, is missing, he hooks up to the interface and now can communicate with his MIA mother. And so we have the plot of the story as Geordi will try to communicate with his mother to find out the location of her missing ship.The story was even made more confusing as when Geordi is hooked up to the interface machine, you have Dr Cusher advising about every four minutes that Gerodi needs to be removed from the interface due to some medical complication. Add the big words and the confusing dialog between Crusher, Data and even Picard all while trying their best to make this dismal story interesting.This episode became weak very early in production. Only in the first few minutes of the show did it stir any excitement. But after those minutes went past, it became obvious that this was going to be a long confusing story. The episode was more baffling than entertaining.",3
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Interface (TV Episode 1993)",A weaker than average episode,"As this episode opens Geordi is testing a new device; it is an interface that allows him to control a probe remotely and experience what the probe detects as though he were there himself. Inevitably it isn't long before this new interface has to be used on a real mission; a Star Fleet ship has become stranding in the atmosphere of a gas giant a probe is launched to search of survivors. In an unfortunate coincidence another ship has gone missing and is presumed lost; one captained by Geordi's mother. As Geordi pilots the probe through the ship he discovers that its crew are dead, he continues to investigate until he is badly burnt; it turns out that under certain conditions dangerous feedback can harm the person using the interface. Wanting to retrieve any data the ship's crew discovered Geordi uses the interface again; this time something strange happens he meets his mother! She explains that her ship is lower in the atmosphere and that what he is seeing is a projection; if she and her crew are to be saved Geordi will have to take the damaged ship lower. The rest of the Enterprise crew are convinced that he is seeing what he wants to see but he is certain that it is his mother and is determined to help even when ordered to stop using the device.This episode was a little disappointing; almost as soon as we see an experimental new device it is being used in an emergency situation. The way the device is depicted is rather strange too; as Geordi steers the probe we see him rather than the probe this might make it easier for us to observe his emotional response to things but it makes no logical sense. When we finally learn how he is seeing his 'mother' even though she was last seen hundreds of light-years away it isn't exactly a surprise; the series has featured so many previously undiscovered lifeforms that another comes as a bit of a cliché. While I like the character of Georgi I think he isn't a good choice to carry an episode as he is the closest the show has to an ordinary bloke; likable but not exactly extrovert every episode where he takes the lead seems to feature a way of forcing him to act somewhat out of character. Overall this was entertaining enough but not as good as one would expect from this series.",6

The answer is for you the viewer to watch.I think the writers here kind of got lost with all science fiction gobbledygook that they had to write to make the story believable.

In short Order, Data is elevated to acting Captain and Worf to First Officer.Riker has been abducted by the raiders he has been chasing, and he gets a big surprise on the bridge of their vessel.These are not common thieves, they have an agenda.

Riker assumes command of the ship and is determined to bring those responsible to justice. The evidence points to a group of mercenaries who have been stealing artefacts from Romulan archaeological sites. A quick check of the local systems identifies their likely next target and a team beams down; they get into a firefight with the mercenaries and Riker is captured. On board the mercenary ship he has quite a surprise when he sees that Picard is far from dead; he is one of the crew! Picard engineers a situation to show that Riker could be useful then tells him how he came to be in his current position. It turns out he had been investigating the mercenaries when they captured him; he claimed to be an archaeologist named Galen and was set to work trying to identify a specific Romulan artefact. Meanwhile Data has taken command of the Enterprise and is searching for the Mercenary ship.This episode gets off to a great start; while I doubt many viewers will think Picard is really dead it still comes as a surprise and leaves people guessing just what really happened. When we do learn that he is still alive the mystery doesn't end; in fact it only deepens. Surely he can't really have gone bad, and once it is established that he hasn't there is still the question of what the mercenaries are actually looking for and for what purpose. There are plenty of tense moments including the shootout with the mercenaries; a scene where Picard encourages the mercenary leader to kill Riker and finally a cliffhanging standoff between the Enterprise and the mercenary vessel.

I assume it's because he's anxious to discover their wicked plans regarding some artifact, though perhaps this was just Picard's mid- life crisis. Regardless, later Riker is captured by the pirates and to avoid being killed, he pretends to be a horrible Starfleet officer--one who is quick to betray the Enterprise to save his own butt. Where is it all going? This episode is slightly better than the follow-up--mostly because the next episode ends poorly.

2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Gambit, Part II (TV Episode 1993)",A Vulcan plot,"This episode, the second of a two part story, opens where the previous part left off; the mercenary ship has fired on the Enterprise but have caused little damage as Picard had arranged for the weapons to 'malfunction' and fire at a lower setting. Sensing that Riker must have a plan Data lets the mercenary ship escape. Having scanned numerous artefacts Picard finally finds the one that the mercenaries have been looking for; something is odd though; all the other items were Romulan but this item appears to be an ancient Vulcan artefact. Soon afterwards the 'Romulan' mercenary identifies herself as an undercover Vulcan agent; she says that the artefact is part of an ancient Vulcan weapon that uses psychic power. Insurgents who believe Vulcan should become isolationist as contact with alien races is 'contaminating their culture'. There is one more part to collect from a Klingon courier before it is taken to Vulcan; then the mercenary leader plans to have Riker eliminate Picard.This was, for the most part, a really good episode. The previous part nicely suggested that the Romulans would ultimately appear as the villains so it was a real surprise to learn that Vulcans are behind the crimes. It was a lot of fun watching Riker and Picard pretending to despise each other as they work to foil the mercenaries' schemes. It was also entertaining to see the Enterprise performing a 'health and safety' inspection on the Klingon shuttle that was transporting another part of the weapon. The episodes weakness was when the Vulcan weapon was actually used and we learn that to work it relies on the victim's own violent urges this gives us a hippyish 'love conquers violence' solution to the problem which was a little disappointing after all the good work before.

But Talerra (Star Trek III's Robin Curtis) is a most unusual Romulan.And Galen is a most unusual smuggler. In fact, if you had already seen Part 1 of this mid-season 2-parter, you would know already that he's Picard, using his old teacher's name.And the Raiders have been stealing specific Relics from ancient Sites. Initially, Picard assumes they are Romulan relics.But a lot has been Assumed in the first part of this twin episode. First Impressions, but mainly Misdirection.Galen tries to incite a mutiny on board the Raider ship, and he starts planting seeds of Dissent. But Tallera finds him out, and in finding out, reveals to Galen her ""true"" identity. But is it just another half- truth? Maybe. The reason why Tallera is so interested in Logic is because her actual race is.I thought I had figured it all out by mid-episode, but there are still reverses to be doled out here.Data finds a Klingon Courier who was to deliver a final piece to this puzzle to Baran (Richard Lynch)- So they fabricate a reason to ""inspect"" his shuttle for fruit flies and Hold him - The Courier Koral (James Worthy) appears to be at least 2 feet taller than Worf, whether he actually is this tall or if it was an effect is no matter, it's effective. And he does not like Worf's Bloodwine. Data and Crusher are as polite as they can be toward him - Until Galen and Riker host a raiding party on the Enterprise and steal back Koral's artifact. Galen ""Kills"" Riker, then beams back to the Raider Ship.Where he deals with Baran, or rather, lets Baran deal with himself with his own punishment device. Bye Bye Baran.Galen and Tallera continue the Pretense and promise fair pay to the Raiders without the threat of a punishment device.What makes these two episodes so great are the reversals upon reversals, piled deck high and planet deep. Who is deceiving who and for what reason?And the artifact is actually a dangerous weapon that had been discarded by the Vulcans long ago, over 2000 years ago.5,000 years before this episode was to take place the Vulcans were a barbaric people until they found Logic - This is established in the Original Trek episode ""All Our Yesterdays""- And in this Next Generation episode, we have a person who is willing to take back that 5,000 years of hard fought social development.It is an entertaining and exiting story with a hard truth attached to it, as there are people in the world today in our neighborhoods, and elected into our governments who will try to roll back Civil Rights to the state they were in previous to the Civil War.Xenophobic Isolationism is how it is referred to here, in our reality it is called ""Extremism"" and just as unpleasant.This second offering in this 2-parter finalizes this interesting and thought provoking episode, full of feints-within-feints and the final resolution is most satisfying - And Logical.ǂ""Rihannsu"" is a non-canon name for the Romulan Race in their native language, used in the ""Rihannsu"" Trek Novels.",10

Picard is playing a mercenary guy named Galen and Riker plays himself--but a selfish slacker version of himself who would sell out his crew to save his sorry butt. Why all the mystery? Well, the pirates are trying to assemble some ancient artifact--one that COULD make someone extremely powerful and very, very dangerous. How can the pair manage to save themselves and the galaxy?This episode was so good and so bad. It's best was a wonderful scene with Galen after he supposedly killed Riker.

Soon, after another nightmare, he ""oversleeps"" since his internal chronometer fails. Data soon experiences strange hallucinations and begins attacking Troi!But what is causing his nightmares? Watch this intriguing episode that delves further into Data's dreams (as began in ""Birthright, Part I"").Trivia note: Clyde Kusatsu reprises his role as Admiral Nakamura (the last time we saw him was in the second season episode ""The Measure Of A Man"", another Data-oriented episode).

Now, for the first time, he's exploring his ability to dream. However, things go pretty weird as his dreams have a repetitive and rather violent nature. So, Data tries to enlist the help of Freud* to tease apart the hidden meaning of these dreams. Later, however Data stabs Counselor Troi (yay!) and the crew quickly realize that Data isn't evil or nuts-- there are some weird giant invisible creatures eating away at them and Data was trying to destroy them. Can they stop these brain slugs before it's too late?This is a fairly good episode. But some of the dreams are so disgustingly weird (such as Dr. Crusher slurping away at Riker's brain with a straw) that I found myself enjoying the show much more! Worth seeing.*It's a bit anachronistic about having the Freudian angle in the show as today most therapists have rejected major portions of analytic therapy. This sort of long, long-term therapy has been supplanted by more short-term and problem-focused therapies (such as Behavioral and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapies). So why in the 24th century is Data consulting with Dr. Freud in the dreams?",8

In this one, he sees Deanna turned into a cake. As she begs him not to cut into the cake he does anyway. The other plot occurring is the enterprise having problems with its warp drive and impulse engines. Time reveals that some sort of foreign entity has attached itself to several crew members and the fact is that if something is not done, they will die from loss of vital body substances, left as a pool of elements. I have never understood the holodeck. Data has a session with Sigmund Freud. Since this is a computer creation of Freud, of what assistance would it be. I suppose the vast computer banks were used to create the essence of Freud. Anyway, this proves to be a bizarre episode but well worth the time.",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Phantasms (TV Episode 1993)",Data's strange dreams,Things are rather strange as this episode opens; Data walks through the corridors of the Enterprise and comes across a trio of old-time miners who are using pick-axes on the ship's systems; they attack Data and pull him apart. He then wakes up; it was just a dream. He had been running a dream program for some time but this is his first nightmare. Counsellor Troi suggests that he shouldn't worry and exploring such dreams could be good for him. His next dream is even stranger; he has an old phone in his chest and cuts into a cake that is Counsellor Troi! It isn't long before the nightmares start leaking into his real life and he stabs a terrified Troi when he sees what appears to be a mouth on her shoulder. Meanwhile problems with the ship's new warp engine looks likely to mean Picard will miss a banquet something he isn't too upset about.This is what Star Trek would be if David Cronenberg guest directed of course this doesn't take things so far but the body horror is certainly weird enough I never thought I'd see Beverly drinking Riker's brain through a large straw! Inevitably Data's dreams prove to be linked to the engine problems and the strange creatures; these creatures are also pretty creepy. With all the slightly disturbing imagery it is just as well that there are some good comic moments; most notably when Data asks Worf to look after Spot and Picard's lack of disappointment when it looks as though he can't get to the banquet.

However, one of the delegate's little girl, Hedril (played by a very young Kirsten Dunst) makes Lwaxana very sad. Soon, she falls unconscious, having retreated into her mind. Troi tries to go into her mother's mind to find out what's happening - it has to do with her past and it all has everything to do with Hedril.Definitely the saddest of the Lwaxana episodes, where she is usually very comedic, but it's nice to see this side of Lwaxana.Trivia note: Worf mentions he does not like telepaths. We see the arboretum again too. We see Troi's father too. Data also refers to his dream analysis (from ""Birthright"" and ""Phantasms""). Mr. Homn is also mentioned (though doesn't appear in this episode).",

In Majel Barrett's final appearance on Next Generation, she gave what was probably the finest performance of her career. It's a shame this new depth of character never had a chance to be built on in later episodes. Lwaxana's crisis was clearly a turning point in her relationship with Deanna, and might have led to some interesting future episodes. It's interesting that I watch the episode and wonder why Majel Barrett wasn't nominated for an Emmy Award, and another review thought she was terrible. To each his own, I guess...",8

So far, this was the only episode that deeply touched my heart, and I´ve ended up crying, tears don´t come out easily to me.
I´ve always found Lwaxana as a bit of annoying character, but not on this episode.
Star Trek was never about FX, Space Exploration nor Alien races... it was always about human complexity, and this episode explores one of the darkest fears.
I´d probably fallen asleep with this episode when I was 14 years old... but not now.",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Dark Page (TV Episode 1993)",A Sad Poignant Episode,"The final season of this series seems beset with the implications of telepathy and personal angst. The characters begin to reveal their inner selves more than at any other time. In this one Lwaxana Troi comes on board with representatives of a race, the Cairn, who communicate only through telepathy. Using technology, they are learning to speak, but it is a hard road to travel. From the beginning Mrs. Troi seems ill. She does her usual annoying judgmental stuff with Deanna (not being married and not getting any younger). She is subject to mood swings and anger. On board is a little Cairn girl played by Kirsten Dunst. She is a free spirit and embraced by the crew. One day, they are in a garden when this little girl falls into a pond. She jumps right out but Lwaxana collapses and the rest of the episode has to do with getting into her comatose subconscious. There is something there that is being repressed. The Cairn leader, who is attracted to Deanna and the father of the little girl, is used to send Deanna into Lwaxana's deep dream world. There is some sort of secret that must be rooted out. This is a really provocative episode, well acted and satisfying in its scope.",8
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Dark Page (TV Episode 1993)",A tragedy in the past of Lwaxana Troi,"This episode sees a group of telepathic aliens, called the Cairn, visit the Enterprise. They are accompanied by Counselor Troi's mother Lwaxana who has been teaching them how to communicate verbally and acting as a translator when they can't think of the necessary words. Deanna notes that her mother isn't her usual effervescent self; it appears that all the telepathic communication has been exhausting her. Then things take a turn for the worse; Lwaxana collapses into a coma just as one of the Cairn children jumps into the water in the ship's arboretum. Maques, the leader of the Cairns, says that he sensed a darkness in Lwaxana's psyche; this is explained as privacy, something the Cairn don't understand. It turns out to be something far more serious; she appears to be suffering from a mental trauma. To try to discover what that is Deanna, with the help of Maques, enters her mother's psyche and encounters many mental blocks before discovering a shocking truth that Lwaxana has been hiding since Deanna was a baby.This episode suffers somewhat from the fact that it is the second in a row which has key scenes taking place within a character's mind and after the weirdness of Data's nightmares the goings on in Lwaxana's mind are relatively mundane. The Cairn are typical 'almost human' aliens; this time ones with ugly bulges on sides of their heads; there is some mystery as we wonder whether they are directly responsible for Lwaxana's condition; it is of interest that Hedril, a Cairn child, is played by a young Kirsten Dunst, before she became famous. When we learn the real cause of Lwaxana's condition it is more tragic than expected and thankfully it is handled well. Overall this is a decent enough episode that would have benefited from being broadcast a bit later when 'Phantasms' wasn't fresh in the viewers' mind and it was nice to see Majel Barrett return as Lwaxana even if the character wasn't quite as extrovert as usual.",7

It's the best Lwaxana Troi episode by far-- most of the shows that feature her are insufferably annoying. Story-wise, it was a great way for Majel Barrett to close out this character on this show (she reappeared in ""Deep Space Nine""), and she is at her best-acting wise as well. It's also much better than almost all of the GOOFY and tedious episodes that I've seen in this season so far.
It has great depth, and it shows the bond between Troi and her mother-- a bond that we will never witness again in Trek history. RIP, Majel Barrett.",8
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Dark Page (TV Episode 1993)",A different Lwaxana Troi,"To be honest, the Lwaxana Troi episodes are the only episodes of TNG and DS9 that I've watched in their entirety, except for one. (Of course, that could change.) I know some people don't care for Lwaxana, but I actually like her. She's quite funny, and while she annoys Deanna, is actually a good mother and sensitive person despite her flirtatious exterior. Out of the 9 episodes featuring Lwaxana, this one is probably my absolute favorite in TNG series next to DS9's The Forsaken and The Muse (honestly, I totally skip over Jake's story line in that episode...) In this episode, we see a completely different Lwaxana than the show previously featured, except for some choice moments in Half a Life. While she starts out driving Picard crazy as usual, her character instantaneously does a complete turnaround when looking at a very young Kirsten Dunst's character, Hedril, reminds her of something from her past. It's well done, as all around her can see something is clearly wrong, despite her assertions that she's fine. Although Lwaxana insists that it's just her ambassadorial duties of helping Hedril's race tiring her out, Deanna can tell it's more than that bothering her mother. A fact that she discloses to Will just before Lwaxana goes off on him and warns him to stay away from Deanna. Before you know it, Lwaxana is in a coma, and the only way to find out what's wrong is for Deanna to get into her mother's mind with a little help from Hedril's father. All in all, there are only a scant few humorous moments, as the episode is a poignant look at how the mind handles grief. Majel Barrett (who is great as Lwaxana anyway) was amazing at portraying an emotionally tumultuous Lwaxana. I would've liked to have seen more from her in both TNG and DS9.",10

I really cared very little for it but by the end, I found myself being sucked into the show in its very moving finale.The Enterprise has some unusual visitors aboard. The Cairn are a race of folks who can read minds and aren't used to spoken language. Because of her ability as an empath, Lwaxana Troi has been selected to act as intermediaries with the Cairn. However, the more she works with them, the more emotionally taxing it all becomes. Eventually, she falls into a near-death coma. How does the Cairn's visit relate to all this?!I guess the bottom line is that although the episode is pretty slow, the solution to Lwaxana's problems is unusual and satisfying--though a bit draining as well.

8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Dark Page (TV Episode 1993)",Just a bad episode.,One of the worst episodes for Star Trek the Next Generation. This episode set a new low for bad makeup effects for aliens. The obviously plastic brain like bulges over each ear of the aliens looked ridiculous. I'm guessing they must have used up most of their seasons budget on previous episodes. The shows budget limitations forced all or most of the aliens to a bi-pedal humanoid form; and that left them with a limited number of things they could do to try to make for different species. Add that to this over wrought cheesy story and that's what brought me to the lowest review I've given to a Star Trek TNG episode. I'm not clear on why the Lwaxana Troi is such a popular character. Majel Barrett always over acted this already over written characters. All the Star Trek fans just fall in line because of her ties to Rodenberry and the original show.

At the same time, the Enterprise must deal with the Kes and Prytt's paranoia in an attempt to rescue Picard and Crusher.Trivia note: the Federation never has allowed ""associate"" membership before - that is, allowing membership for only one of the societies on any one planet (in every instance, membership is allowed only once the planet is unified). We also find out that Crusher has a fear of heights.",

As part of this process Picard and Dr Crusher beam down to the planet. Things go wrong though and their signal is somehow intercepted and they find themselves in a Prytt Prison with implants in their necks. The Kes ambassador explains that the Prytt, the planet's other nation, are a secretive and paranoid race. A Kes agent gives Picard and Crusher the means to escape but as they head to a safe rendezvous point they learn that the implants give them a psychic link that forces them to share their thoughts, it also makes them feel nauseous if they move more than a few yards apart. As time passes this link strengthens and some previously unstated thoughts are fully exposed; notably the feeling they have for each other. Back on the Enterprise the Kes ambassador proves to be just as paranoid as the Prytt; when Picard and Crusher don't turn up at the rendezvous point he suggests that the Federation must be in league with the Prytt!This was an interesting episode thanks to the character development we get between Picard and Crusher; Patrick Stewart and Gates McFadden are on top form here and provide some genuinely touching moments as the feelings they have had for each other are exposed. The story about the Kes and the Prytt primarily serves to put Picard and Crusher in this position but is also rather interesting in its own right; it was fun seeing the paranoia of the Kes ambassador being exposed; starting with his being a bit over-concerned about being overheard leading to his completely bonkers accusations about the Federation allying itself with the Prytt. Overall a good emotional episode with some tense moments too.",8

Picard and Crusher go to the surface to begin negotiations with one of the factions, only to be misdirected to the other group which arrests them as spies. They are able to escape their captors due to inter-mediators, but the escape isn't easy. On the Enterprise, things aren't going well and Worf and Riker have about had it with their ""guestss."" Meanwhile, Jean-Luc and Beverly, who when imprisoned had some devices planted on them, begin to read each other's thoughts. This makes them uncomfortably realize the affection and love they have for each other. As they move to escape, there are tender scenes between them where they act like teenagers at a school dance.

Soon, however, the Captain and Dr. Crusher are kidnapped by their rivals, the Prytt. These rivals are described by the Kes as unreasonable and paranoid--something that you later see is true of both sides. I would also add childish! Through some help from the Kes (who soon come to suspect and hate the Enterprise crew), Picard and Crusher are able to escape their prison and go on a cross-country trek. However, during this time together they realize that the brain implants their captors put on them allow them to read each other's thoughts! At first it's quite embarrassing though eventually the two learn about each other's deepest yearnings and it brings them closer.This is a very good episode for two reasons. First, it was nice to FINALLY see some sort of discussion of the attraction between Picard and Crusher--something almost every fan wanted. Second, the show had a nice sense of humor when Riker negotiated with the two sides-- and his solution was exactly what the situation needed. All in all, a very satisfying episode.",9

Suspicion falls on a Ferengi vessel that had been seen in the area. The Enterprise finds the Ferengis but they appear to be dead in space. After a brief confrontation it emerges that they had activated a mine which had been disguised as a navigation buoy. The Enterprise investigates further and triggers such a mine soon after is boarded by two aliens. They are a brother and sister who claim that ship's warp engines are causing dangerous effects near their home world that will ultimately cause a spatial rift that could destroy the planet. Picard promises to forward their research to the Federation but that isn't enough for the sister she decides to prove her theory in a suicide mission that deliberately causes a warp core breach in her ship. The resulting explosion does indeed cause a rift and the medical ship is caught inside it; the crew of the Enterprise will have to find a way to rescue them which doesn't involve using the warp engines within the rift. In an early side story Geordi has difficulty while looking after Data's cat; Data tries to train it but his efforts have little effect; we also have another side plot involving Geordi trying to increase the engine efficiency as part of a rivalry with an engineer on another ship.This was a fairly disappointing episode; it starts with a rather unnecessary plot involving Data's cat that, while amusing at times, didn't really go anywhere. Likewise the subplot about Geordi's rivalry with a fellow engineer didn't add anything to the story. These aren't the main problems with the episode though; that is the overly preachy nature of the main plot. We are clearly meant to see a parallel with the problems caused by warp travel and pollution. We also have the unlike way that the female alien causes a rift to prove her point in a way that will probably affect her planet far more than the passing warp-powered ship. The resolution where a speed limit of Warp Five is imposed on the Federation seems to be something that could limit future stories although I don't recall this limit being applied in 'Voyager' and 'Deep Space Nine'. Overall a rather disappointing episode where the subplots go nowhere and the main story is overly preachy.",6

The plot is clearly a variation on a plot about pollution, global cooling and global cooling. Whether you believe or disbelieve the climate change theories, the episode just comes off as preachy and could have used a great infusion of energy and humor. It's just terribly preachy.When the Enterprise goes through a portion of space, it finds that it and other ships that recently went through this area were disabled--and soon it becomes certain why. A local race believes that the use of warp engines is damaging space--and they intend to put a stop to it any way they can. Well, the Captain is able to get one of these scientists to agree that the Federation should send scientists to investigate whereas his sister is insistent that the time to make huge changes is now and no one should investigate because she proved warp engines the bad. See the parallels to today?The show also has an underdeveloped plot involving Spot the cat. It really seemed tacked on--like a time filler. And, oddly, it was dropped from the show and never really addressed after about a third of the way into the show. The bottom line is that the script seemed a bit of a mess and lacked one important element--FUN.",3

Reed and Corbett are truly dedicated to their beliefs, as much as any earth scientist in our history ridiculed for their new theories like Isaac Newton or Louis Pasteur.In fact Reed's not willing to have the Federation scientists come out to study the problem after her ideas have to go through Federation bureaucracy. She makes her point quite dramatically.In this most serious episodes apparently it was decided that a little comic relief was necessary. This is provided by Brent Spiner discussing with LeVar Burton the methods of training a cat. I could have told them that cats are lovable, but not trainable.

5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Force of Nature (TV Episode 1993)",A terrible attempt at an anti-pollution episode,"This was a terrible episode. And it would foreshadow the mediocre direction of Brannon Braga produced Star Trek. This episode was meant to make people think about pollution. But it used the fictitious warp drive as the method and created a story line that says warp speed was damaging space. All that was achieved was the very clear idea that Braga looked at his viewers as if they were children. This episode felt very much like some light made for kids show with superheroes giving us sermons of how we should live our lives. This show may have been a swing for the fences by Braga in terms of landing some sort of award like the Peabody. Whatever his goal, it failed miserably. Near the end the cast all take turns delivering political points on protecting the environment of space from further damage and the scene plays like a cheesy public service message. It is incredible that they did not have the actors go ahead and officially break the 4th wall and deliver a message to the viewers from Braga. And they may as well have done that since the scene was so obviously written to make Trek and the actors look politically correct and the lines seemed to come from the actors not the characters. This was very close to being The Next Generation's worst episode and unfortunately all of Braga's Enterprise and 75% of Voyager was far worse. Brannon Braga is to Star Trek as Joel Schumacher to Batman. Braga killed Trek just as Schumacher killed the 90's Bat-films. Both are two men with no talent or instinct for entertainment and should be kept away from it FOREVER!!",1

Turns out warp travel is ripping holes in the fabric of space, and Starfleet needs to take its foot off the gas. And that adds dramatic heft so instances where time is of the essence. Remember when Picard ignored his superiors in ""First Contact"" and ordered maximum warp to the Borg skirmish? He wasn't playing around. But now, the episode comes off preachy. It's all about the message and belaboring the point. And I still think it's an interesting point to be made, but maybe not with a sledehammer. 6/10",6

The dramatic use of subterfuge to prove their point could made the brother and sister true terrorists. Of course, what they want is for the powers that be to listen to them before it is too late.

8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Force of Nature (TV Episode 1993)",Dr. Serova is even dumber than they intended to portray her.,The premise of this episode is one that hinges on the stupidity of a character. Dr. Serova is already portrayed as irresponsible but we're also meant to take away that she's a genius who can see something nobody else can. She forces a warp core breach and sacrifices her life in the explosion to prove that massive amounts of warp energy will disrupt subspace and cause a rift that would prevent warp. She does this because the effect is supposedly cumulative and traditional warp engine energy is only a tiny fraction of the amount required to cause a rift. If that's the case then eventually it would become pretty obvious she was right as ship traffic continues over the years to come. She'd have been proven right eventually and likely with plenty of time to do something about it; all without her having to kill herself like a dummy. There was no reason to do what she did at all.,3

That's Christian Bale with some clay glommed on his forehead. I am certain. Check out the voice and the mannerisms. It could be right out of American Psycho.

Too bad those responsible for the mess created won't be alive then to suffer the consequences, but their descendants will.I didn't expect this kind of opinions on this episode, especially since TNG primarily speaks to intelligent and open-minded viewers, who would supposedly understand that if you leave your trash in front of your home, it will eventully stink and produce all kinds of bugs and other... ""inconveniences"". It's the same with pollution on Earth and the same with the effect of the warp drive on normal space in the fictional TNG universe. By definition, a warp drive is warping space to move an object instead of increasing the kinetic energy of the object, by generating warp fields to form a subspace bubble that envelops the starship, distorting the local spacetime continuum and moving the starship at velocities that could greatly exceed the speed of light. It's similar to folding a thin piece of metal, to get one side next to the other. Now, even children know what happens when you quickly and repeatedly do this to that thin piece of metal: it eventually breaks - just like paper is easier to tear in a straight line after folding it and the same as space does after being repeatedly ""warped"" (i.e. folded) in the same location(s) by starships. Bottom line, there's nothing ""preachy"" about the scenario in this episode, just like it's nothing ""preachy"" about the fact that pollution or deforestation are endangering life on Earth - it's simply the truth.So, what can you do faced with these close-minded, bureaucracy oriented and irresponsible people, who would either not believe or not take or delay any measure to alleviate or correct the damage? You'd do what the alien's sister did in this episode, sacrificing safety for understanding and appropriate reaction. Maybe the reviewers who considered this fine episode ""preachy"" need to experience the same - there's nothing more convincing than having to fight for survival.

She was there at Data's inception, and even had to make a harsh decision to leave him to his fate in a crisis. She has always regretted this. There is a subplot where his mother and her current mate are trying to stabilize underground links on the planet. She seems to be smarter than her son when it comes to this technology.

This gives Data the false impression that she is also a Soong-Type Android, like he is.But she is not quite the same - For one thing, she is not as sturdy as he is, and is damaged when Data pushes her off one of the many rock faces we see in Next Generation.For all intents and purposes, she is the same person as the one she was built to replace, and even possibly an improvement on Data himself - She has emotions, she fools Medical Scanners into thinking she is Human, she has sweat glands, breathes, has tear ducts, and ages like any other ""real"" person. This episode also reveals that Data was built to ""age"" as well. And, finally, Data knows beyond a doubt that he is no longer Unique in the universe.

Here they will work with local scientists to re-liquefy the core. That only turns out to be a minor part of the story though; one of the scientists tells Data that she is the ex-wife of his creator Dr. Noonien Soong and was involved in his creation in effect she is his mother. Data unsure about her but they grow closer as she tells him about his early life and how his memory had been wiped after an awkward childhood and eventually admits that it was her choice to abandon him when the Crystalline Entity attacked their world. Eventually Data learns a shocking fact about his mother something it turns out he suspected.This is another character driven episode which gives us an interesting insight into Data's past. It also serves to remind us of things seen in previous episodes as Data tells his mother about Noonien Soong's death and shows her a painting of his 'daughter' Lal. As well as such touching moments there are some amusing scenes too such as when Data's mother assumes his visit to Troi is part of a romance and when she tells of how he refused to wear clothes when first activated. Fionnula Flanagan puts in a fine performance as Data's mother and as expected Brent Spiner is great playing both Data and a holographic representation of his father. Over all a good episode with some emotional moments and a good twist.,7

Not surprisingly, most of the episode involves Data and Dr. Juliana Soong getting to know each other and Juliana filling in blanks that Data was missing regarding his creation and Dr. Soong. She also talks about Lore and mentions that there were other android projects. However, as they continue to get to know each other, Data notices some inconsistencies--making him wonder exactly WHO she really is.This is a decent episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""--as are most Data episodes. While it's not nearly as much fun or exciting as the Lore episodes, it is interesting and well worth seeing.",8

Soon, he discovers that instead of winning the tournament, he came in ninth. His memory lapses then get even worse and reality appears to change around him though no one else notices.What is happening to Worf?

1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Parallels (TV Episode 1993)",The FRINGE Episode of ST:TNG,"Or, ""There is more than one of the road not taken""This episode of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION follows a plot device used in the series FRINGE. Mainly, the possibility of Alternate Universes and the ability to traverse them.In this Ep, as in FRINGE, the traversal of alternate realities is at first not intentional. In fact, Worf has no idea this is what is happening, until several iterations later, an alternate DATA figures it out. As possibly, so did the Data from ""Our"" (Or rather, Worf's Reality).This ep follows a theory of Quantum Flux, partially that ""all matter in a universe resonates on a quantum level with a unique signature"" - And Worf is not exhibiting the correct Quantum Signature for the Universe he is in. This also happens in the 2nd season of Fringe when Peter Bishop is perceived by Olivia Dunham to be resonating with the signature of matter from the ""Alternate Universe/Other Side"". What is causing Worf to ""Flip through Universes""? This episode is very disarming and disturbing.In Fringe, this is explored within the realm of two, possibly Three Quantums/Alternate Realities, in this episode, we are dealing with hundreds of Alternate Trek universes, possibly an unlimited amount. We are shown Trek universes where Picard was killed by the Borg, and Riker is the Captain of the Enterprise, with Trombone and all in the Waiting Room. And Worf personally experiences finding out that he is married to Deanna Troi - And has Children in one universe with her, and never fathered Alexander! And there are Cardassian Ensigns rather than Bajorans serving on the Enterprise (A male Cardassian Ensign is seen Piloting the Enterprise, instead of Bajoran Ensign Ro Laren).Mostly this Episode is based on the phrase: ""Everything that Could happen, DOES happen"". - This episode reveals, the existence of a Quantum Fissure, a fixed point in space and time that intersects all Quantum Realities - And Worf's Shuttlecraft has flown right through this point, causing him to be susceptible for transference from one Quantum to the next. At first the universes are very similar to ""our"" Trek 'Verse, later in the episode, the differences become apparent, sometimes drastic. As the Data from Worf's last Quantum Shift states: ""For Any Event, there is an Infinite Number of Possible Outcomes - Our choices determine which outcomes will follow. But there is a theory in Quantum Physics, that all possibilities that can happen, DO happen, in alternate Quantum Realities"".This episode is an excellent exploration of that Theory, a graphic illustration of this- As Worf traverses the realities and is exposed to different choices made not only by him, but the other Enterprise Crew.This is precisely the kind of writing that is used in the Fox series FRINGE, and is a major part of the story in seasons 2 through 4 of that series. But in 1994, we had this Trek episode, a surprisingly well written episode by trek writer Brannon Braga who was always kept on hand to come up with ideas- He had hit his stride in Next Generation, some of his scripts and stories were not well written or received (Braga was the one who ""Destroyed the Enterprise D"" in Star Trek: Generations) but this one episode stands out as being very clever writing and a good fulfilling story. Braga would have fared well for Fringe with ideas like these.Some Trek fans surmise, that Trek was running on pure ""Brownian Motion"" all through it's 7th Season, but this episode plainly proves that there was still some innovation in Trek writing in S7. And we also must give Michael Dorn some credit for his acting in this ep.",
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Parallels (TV Episode 1993)",What is happening to Worf?,"After winning a batleth competition Worf returns to the Enterprise and a dreaded surprise birthday party. Shortly after cutting the cake something strange happens; he has a dizzy spell then is handed a slice of sponge cake, this is strange because he had just cut a chocolate cake. He shrugs it off but starts having more dizzy spells and each time something different changes. At first it is small things; the picture Data gave him, the fact that he came ninth rather than won the competition, then he couldn't compete at all. Later still things get radically different; Riker is commander of the Enterprise and Worf finds himself married to Troi! Investigations eventually show that his shuttle passed through a spatial anomaly and the after effects have left him bouncing between various realities; returning to the anomaly leads to the realities meeting and numerous alternate versions of the Enterprise appearing. If things are to be set right they will have to identify which of the thousands of ships Worf came from so he can take its shuttle back into the anomaly.I really enjoyed this episode for the very reason I suspect others will dislike it; as things changed for Worf I liked the confusion as things kept changing in ways that only Worf, and the viewer, notice. As well as the obvious changes there are enjoyably subtle changes such as the way the com badges change in later realities. For most of the episode there is also the question as to whether what we are seeing is really happening or if it is something being done to Worf for unknown reasons. Michael Dorn does a fine job as Worf; nicely portraying his confusion and frustration as reality changes around him. This story hints at a possible future romance between Worf and Troi as he comes to see her as potentially more than a friend it will be interesting to see how that develops. Overall an enjoyable episode that keeps one wondering what is really happening.",9
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Parallels (TV Episode 1993)",That's Worf All Over!,"This is a highly entertaining episode. It accomplishes two things. First of all, there is the matter of time distortion and parallel universes. Secondly, there is the human (Klingon) development on board the ship. Worf has many lives, set in motion by random acts. He even has a marriage and children with Deanna Troi. Objects and events scatter about and he is the epicenter and the control in everything. Because of the open mindedness of the crew, he is able to at least get, what would seem a ludicrous theory, listened to. He has returned from a Klingon martial arts tournament, victorious, but in one scene, his trophy for first place morphs into one for ninth place. What I found most entertaining is that I hadn't seen this condition before and the conclusion is quite acceptable. Michael Dorn as Worf does a nice job as the focus of this episode.",9

From the point when Picard asks Worf how the tournament went to the final seconds of the beginning of Worf's and Deanna's nascent romance, replete with some of the most beautiful and haunting 15 seconds of music in the entire series, it is just a crowning jewel on this beloved episode.

While I've heard complaints over the years about the abundance of these sorts of stories on Star Trek, I've ever had that problem with them, at least as far as TNG is concerned. They usually go together pretty well. Turns out it's a good hook for a Worf episode, primarily because it's the ship's resident tough-guy who's slipping between different realities. It's actually kinda scary when a Klingon battle cruiser shows up and your tactical officer is drawing a blank. The camera tricks and editing keep you on your toes, and the story keeps shifting. Even the cast flickers in and out, with Wesley showing up on the bridge at one point. Overall, it's an entertaining one.7/10",7

Then things get weird, and Worf finds himself in a predicament that can't be solved with honor, courage, or punching someone.The plot takes ideas from previous episodes (""Frame of Mind,"" ""Future Imperfect,"" etc.) and combines them in a way that avoids feeling like a rehash. The scenes with Worf and Troi work surprisingly well, thanks in no small part to Michael Dorn's facial expressions.Speaking of faces, Wesley Crusher makes an appearance, looking like he's aged about a decade more than the rest of the crew. Must be a tough gig being the 20-year-old Chief of Goldshirts aboard the most prestigious ship in the fleet.",8

First, his birthday cake changes flavors and then his trophy for winning now is for 9th place! Later, after many more changes, the evidence is that he never even attended the tournament. But it gets more extreme and one of the changes finds Worf married to Counselor Troi! Oddly, Worf is the only one who is aware of these changes.On IMDb, this is a very highly rated episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". I assume this is because you get to see all sorts of alternatives for the characters--such as Worf getting married and many other changes. However, I really hated the show because it was so reliant on so much stuff that just sounded like a lot of mumbo-jumbo--with talk about fissures in the space-time continuum, lots of quantum realities and an inverse warp field. It reminds me of the Voltaire song about this aspect of the show called the ""USS Make S*** Up""--about how lots of silly solutions for each escape are just pulled out of thin air.",4

With any Trek series there comes the temporal episode. These types of episodes are hit or miss; some being great, like ""timescape"" and some not so great like ""Parallels"". ""Parallels"" comes off as insincere and flat. Troi's performance is decent, but the Worf, Troi romance never made since like the Worf, Dax relationship in DS9.I did like the idea of the bat'leth tournament. Too bad no one ever wrote an episode about that. In the future Star Trek should focus on aspects of the unique cultures it has created. Sometimes the elaborate time warp episodes are too much, and ""Parallels"" is an example of this.",5

But also what makes this episode unique is that it's focused on Worf. This is really something different for the character as we see him actually play the detective role, which I thought was interesting and a change of pace from his usual role of being a combatant.Worf is really sympathetic as we are in the same boat as him asking all of the same questions like ""What the hell is going on?"" and ""How does he get off this ride?"" Each of these different enterprises Worf inaventantly travels to each one, where we see their different from the smallest details from simple decision, what occurred and what didn't.Down to even the biggest details like seeing Comander Riker commanding the enterprise which is sort of prolific as he does get to command a ship of his own the U.S.S. Titan in the expanded universe books. But also seeing Denna Troy and Worf as a couple which I'll admit I never thought would ever happen but they way it's handled it really felt plausible, I really liked seeing the chemistry between both of them how Denna interacted toward him I actually bought it. Of course this was also prolific as latter in the season both become a couple for a while at least.In any reality, anything to everything is possible.Rating: 4 stars",10

One of the highlights of the episode is seeing Riker get yelled at, separately, by both Picard and the admiral. Any viewer who's ever been caught in the crossfire between their boss and the boss' boss will certainly relate.While I'm generally not into nitpicks, this one is too good to pass up: In one scene, Riker and the admiral are discussing the Big Secret in Ten-Forward (a.k.a. the ship's bar), making sure to emphasize that nobody must find out about it...within earshot of at least a dozen people.

I like Star Trek, and I just finished re-watching TNG because of the disaster that Discovery is, but you know what, this series is just as hypocritical and preachy. I did not catch this when I saw it originally as a kid, but now I can see where the writers of Discovery got their inspiration. Still no excuse for all their other failings, but I can forgive them about the preachiness since it seems to be part of the Trek DNA. So that's my only complaint with Trek in general.

5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Pegasus (TV Episode 1994)",What is 'The Experiment'?,"When news that the USS Pegasus, a ship that was assumed destroyed twelve years previously, is reported to have been found its former commander, Admiral Pressman, comes aboard the Enterprise to take command of the recovery mission. It isn't long before suspicions are raised about the Pegasus's final mission as we see Riker, who was a young ensign on that mission, and Pressman talk about 'The Experiment' and the possibility that it may be restarted. We then learn that there was a mutiny aboard and Riker was one of the few people to stand by his captain. When they get to the site of the Pegasus they find a Romulan ship is already searching the location; Pressman is determined that they don't get their hands on it but he is also determined that destroying it will be the last option. Eventually they find the Pegasus deep within an asteroid; fused with the rock. The Enterprise is taken in via a narrow fissure but are trapped when the Romulans 'accidentally' seal the way out. To get out they will have to use 'The Experiment' a phased-cloaking device that will enable them to pass through solid rock but is strictly banned by treaty.This is a fine episode with plenty of intrigue; as soon as 'The Experiment' is mentioned I wanted to know what it involved the fact that it was so secret that Pressman ordered Riker not to mention it to anybody, including Picard, made it sound somewhat sinister. It was interesting to learn more about Riker's past; not only about the events on the Pegasus but also the reason why Picard selected him to be his First Officer. Riker's forced secrecy causes a degree of tension between him and Picard and at times threatens their relationship; both professionally and personally. Guest star Terry O'Quinn does a fine job as Pressman even though we can guess that his character is a wrong-un almost from the moment he is introduced. It was great to see that some within the usually all too perfect Federation are willing to break the rules. If the episode has a real flaw it is the fact that there is no explanation as to why there have been no further attempts to create a cloaking device in the previous twelve years.

But submarines can break an ocean going foe by being able to conceal themselves in the depths of the ocean, and attack targets with impunity. Today, capable of carrying nuclear tipped ICBMs, they are the most powerful weapon in our military today.So, why on Earth would you, as a leader of some futuristic space nation, deny your armed force this capability? And, on top of that, allow a foe who has sworn to destroy you, have that same capability which you've agreed not to have?It's just another notch of stupidity in a show that claims to be high brow, but is, in reality, a lame brained excuse to look at psychological issues, even when the plot doesn't make sense or has massive loop holes and other forms of illogic in the story.I just can't wrap my skull around why this show continues to get praises for lapses in good thinking. Could not the plot have been reworked to show a deficiency in cloaking technology, or some more pragmatic idea to show why Star Fleet doesn't use that Romulan gizmo?But no, instead the plot and logic thereof or unimportant. According to the producers what's important is that the emotional clash between officers and the idea of a mutiny on a starship for idiotic story reasons. Production values are first rate; sets, acting, makeup ... eh, the SFX are a little lacking but passable, but aside from that, the story is flimsy. If you're going to postulate a mutiny on a volunteer service vessel, then maybe you can ash-can your ivory tower sociology mind and take your ego and shove it some place dark, dank, and full of foul odor, because the condescension here reeks of idiocy.Reason; you mutiny because you're captain is abusive, immoral, unbalanced, and has put ship and compliment in danger.

There's also the big question looming overhead: what was the ""experiment"" that led to a mutiny and the loss of a ship in deep space? The moving parts of this are all well-coordinated and O'Quinn plays a good villain (in a long line of sociopathic admirals).

10,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Pegasus (TV Episode 1994)",the reason i am here..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 07The seventh act of the series seemed like an overstretched material where the writers were clearly running out of ideas, although to balance it properly, there are few brilliant concepts that defines the ingenious of Star Trek.The PegasusIt's Picard's day and Stewart makes sure he deserves the content he has in his hands, it's a classic government policies and secret agendas adding in a pinch of politics track, that gives us a more hands on picturization than we usually get.",
11,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Pegasus (TV Episode 1994)",Hypocrisy,"A previous reviewer named ""anoldblackmarble"" absolutely nailed it. Especially during this season the captain does fake outrage then throws away his convictions when it suits him. This episode has such an intriguing and engaging backstory that I was leaning toward rating it positively despite my misgivings about the captain and the crew's hypocrisy. But just as I was nearing the completion of the ""Lower Decks,"" WHICH IS JUST A FEW SHOWS AFTER THIS ONE, I noticed that almost immediately after Riker notifies Picard, ""launching a probe in a Cardassian space would be a treaty violation,"" he ORDERS WORF TO LAUNCH A PROBE. WTF?!?! So he wants to pontificate about the RIGHTEOUSNESS of such things only when he has personal misgivings about someone?

0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Homeward (TV Episode 1994)",Prime Directive Doesn't Apply Here,"The problem with this episode is that Picard clearly misinterprets what the Prime Directive is all about. The Prime Directive is about non-interference with a planetary society's culture. However, it says nothing about allowing an entire species to become extinct because of forces outside of that society's control (such as the natural disaster threatening to extinguish life from the surface of the planet in this episode). Essentially, his view would be that if a culture hasn't developed space flight capability on its own and a planetary disaster falls upon them, they should be allowed to die off.Clearly, that view flies in the face of the Original Series episode ""All Our Yesterdays"" where the Enterprise tried to save some of the people of the planet Sarpeidon when its sun was going supernova. Star Fleet had ordered Kirk to rescue at least some of the people there, people who had not developed space flight capability.So with the precedent already established in the Original Series, Picard's strained view simply doesn't hold any water especially since Worf's brother came up with a fairly ingenious way to transport the people without impacting their culture.",2

The Enterprise responds to an emergency distress call from Worf's brother who is stationed on Boraal II, a planet whose atmosphere was rapidly deteriorating and will soon disappear.While Nikolai pleas with Picard to save the people down there, the captain says they can't do anything because of the Prime Directive. However, the rebellious Nikolai countermands the captain's orders and transport the people to the Holodeck in a bold plan to take them on a ""journey"" to a new place where they can live (aka, a new hospitable planet), without them ever knowing they left their own planet. It is Nikolai and Worf who will lead them.The plan seems to work except for one Boraalin who discovers the Holodeck Door and finds himself on the Enterprise.

To top that, Nikolai has another ""little"" surprise up his sleeve.Find out what happens in this thought-provoking episode.Trivia note: Worf hasn't seen his brother in 4 years (presumably since the 4th season episode ""Family"" when Worf visited his human parents on Earth).

2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Homeward (TV Episode 1994)","Unlike Hitchcoc, I actually really liked this one.","I can understand the review by Hitchcoc and his disliking the show. After all, everyone likes different things. As for me, I really liked this one and thought it brought up some interesting points.Dr. Nikolai Rozhenko (Paul Sorvino) is working on planet as an observer. The locals believe he's one of them and he's become a part of their community. While this is a bit odd and skirts the limits of the Prime Directive, it gets worse. The planet is doomed and will soon be bereft of all life. The Prime Directive calls for non-interference but Rozhenko is determined to do ANYTHING to insure the continuation of these nice people. But they know nothing of space travel and he cannot simply take them aboard a Federation ship to resettle them elsewhere...and the Prime Directive would indicate that he leaves them. However, against Picard's express wishes, Rozhenko beams the few survivors onto a holodeck simulation that LOOKS like their shelter on the planet below and they THINK they are all still there! Now what? Oh, and to complicate things, Roshenko is Worf's step-brother!!I liked the show because it stretched the limits of the non- interference policy of the Federation. And, as I watched, I thought the Captain and the crew were incredibly callous (annoyingly so) towards the folks on the planet--so I liked seeing Sorvino, who is not a Starfleet officer, throw the policy out the window! Pretty interesting and well written.",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Homeward (TV Episode 1994)",The flaws in the Prime Directive,"When the Enterprise receives a distress call from Worf's brother Nikolai, who is observing the natives if Boraal II they learn that the planet is about to suffer the total loss of its atmosphere. Nikolai is determined that they must save some of the native population but Captain Picard is adamant that the Federations Prime Directive means that they must be left to die. Nikolai doesn't take no for an answer and beams a group of Boraalan into the holodeck, which he has programmed to simulate the caves they were sheltering in. Picard is furious when he learns of this but as he can't beam them back to a now dead planet he agrees to transport them to similar planet. To avoid the Boraalans learning that they are on a different world they create a program that will enable them the trek from the simulated caves to a simulation of the site of their new village; with gradual changes in the terrain as they go. There are some problems when the holodeck starts to malfunction but Worf, who has been subject to surgical alteration and his brother describes as a seer, makes up excuses that they believe. One problem can't be explained though one of the Boraalans wanders away from the group and exits the holodeck; no amount of excuses can explain what he sees; will he be able to return to the others; if he does and he tells them what he has seen it will either change their society forever or he will be treated like a madman.This episode has a good basic idea; I liked the idea that a group of people is to be transported to an entirely different planet without their knowledge and Worf's various excuses for strange goings on were rather amusing. On the other hand Picard's insistence that they must not interfere with the Boraalan's 'natural development' even though that means they would be extinct in a few hours went beyond being officious and cold hearted; it was like watching somebody calmly watching a child drown while saying how sad it was then being furious when somebody else rescued them. This could have been justified if by the end of the story the idea that the rule about non-interference being absolute was questioned but we just know that if he encountered an identical situation again Picard would have the same reaction. Overall this episode has some good ideas but I can't say I enjoyed it as the actions of major characters made me angry.",6
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Homeward (TV Episode 1994)",Poor writing indeed.,"To add to what ShogaNinja said, Picard expresses a lot of anger at Nikolai for creating this situation and coming up with such a ridiculous solution. Then at the end of the episode Crusher asks Picard if he regrets saving the tribe and he says ""No, and our plan worked perfectly."" Even though the tribe now believes in a magical Worf and some God called ""La Forge"" the same way the proto-Vulcans in ""Who Watches the Watchers"" believed in ""The Picard."" I thought Nikolai's use of the holodeck was rather brilliant but the line of BS he came up with sell it to the tribe was utter lunacy. ""Duck inside your tents and my brother will make the storm disappear!"" Won't they be questioning him for the rest of his life about his magical brother? Why not just knock them out with some gas and then later say the storm dissipated while they were asleep?The episode also entirely avoids the ethical question of letting someone die rather than violate your policy of non-interference. The Prime Directive is supposed to prevent them from negatively impacting another culture. Since the only alternative is the extinction of that culture does it really apply? Wouldn't a culture influenced by alien visitation still be preferable to no culture at all? This episode really makes Picard out to be a puppet of Starfleet dogma. I'm reminded of Jor-El's words in the 1979 movie, ""Is it now a crime to cherish life?""",3
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Homeward (TV Episode 1994)",Bad Writing,"This episode is full of suppositions, plot holes, and really bad writing.We meet Nikolai, Worf's foster-brother, the son of his Russian foster parents who we have met before and who also currently raising Alexander. When Nikolai introduces Worf to the village he tells them that Worf is his brother. Yet none of these suspicious people were chiming in with "" well, why is your skin different colors then?"" Yet later we are to believe the one guy is a little TOO inquisitive and finds his way onto the Enterprise. mmmmhmm. UNLESS they are an alien race that skin color is variable upon birth. There seemed to be wide demographic makeup in the village to support this theory.Then they come back and get un-surgeried, only to turn around and be ordered back INTO surgery to get facially altered AGAIN within hours. Geez. If it's that easy why doesn't everyone look like supermodels? They could have made Dr. Polaski sexy?They should have never been tricked by Nikolai in the first place... for many reasons. A:The crew is experienced, they have dealt with ferengi and Q alike. What's this one man compared to that? B. His intent was obvious to anyone and he had a motive which he displayed openly. C. Deanna Troi would detect his intent in about a nanosecond. D. Even through the convenient ""interference"" they would have detected that the transporters were being used - they have logs for a reason. E. Who operated those transporters? A civilian scientist who doesn't know his way around the ship, or that it had a ""new"" holodeck, one who failed out of the Academy in the first year. Hardly good enough to make such precise calculations to aim all of them into the holodeck unbeknownst to them. And how would he know when they were all asleep anyway?Later the Captain is informed that they have to hurry because the holodeck is losing stability. Why not fix the other holodecks and transport them over in their sleep or whatever?Then they just let him go? Why not make him stand charges as a civilian? They do have laws about that for civilians I'm sure too. It was never even discussed only that ""You're career is over!"" We can't have civvies going around and changing the universe whenever they feel like can we? Treating the prime directive like a suggestion? Rule of thumb? Wives' tale?There was one funny moment in this episode and that was when that woman told Worf they should be family because she is pregnant with his brother's baby. His reaction is HILARIOUS.There was just too many conveniently lined up variables that make up this craptastic episode all created by the writer/s. All to further some really inconsistent and bad writing and squeeze another one out before the finale. You may actually find yourself making fart noises while you watch this episode. (In the end when they pretend they are brothers who reconciled. lol.)With the series coming to a close you think they wouldn't waste time filming a stinker like this one. 5/10 (hey it's still TNG)",5

He has embedded himself with a group of people whose planet is doomed. They have taken refuge underground, but their days are numbered. Because of the prime directive, Picard refuses Nikolai's request to save them. Brother decides to go it on his own, using the Holodeck as a holding place, causing these people to believe they have not left their planet. To get to the point, he forces Picard, et. al., to search for a planet that can sustain them. They will then be beamed down as they sleep. There is a slip up when one of them escapes the Holodeck and must be dealt with appropriately.

7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Homeward (TV Episode 1994)",Would have been great if not for the prime directive nonsense,"I really liked Paul Sorvino as Worf's brother and the conflict between them seemed genuine except for the ridiculous interpretation of the Prime Directive, which is the Federation policy of non interference in a society that hasn't developed warp drive. First, Picard has broken that rule many times in the past. Maybe he's evolved, become more conservative in his old age? That still leaves the interpretation of the directive in the first place, which, to give them credit, they do address in the episode. Supposedly it's not about allowing societies to evolve on their own, it's about ensuring noninterference. But the point is to allow a civilization to develop naturally, so if the whole planet is going to be destroyed, what's the point in enforcing the Prime Directive? They didn't debate this much at all in the episode, which made the rest of the story feel a bit contrived. Troi of all people was the one defending the use of the Prime Directive to justify letting this civilization be wiped out. It seemed out of character for both her and Picard, who got really angry at Worf's brother simply because he was trying to save a doomed people. That shaky foundation as the premise of the episode really took a lot away from it and could have been avoided with a bit more creativity in the writing room. But if you can get past that, it's a pretty good episode.",6

perish. But that old prime directive says let things occur. That wouldn't sit with
me either.Sorvino plays Worf's human foster brother for as you remember during Worf's
formative years he was raised by human after losing his Klingon family and 
Sorvino is a bit of a rebel. He's not in Starfleet so prime directive means nothing to him. I say bully for what he did.He got the Enterprise to transport the whole tribe and the idea is to use hollow
decks to make them think they're still on the planet while Enterprise transports
them to a new suitable home. And Michael Dorn who is all about honor and
duty and order being obeyed is aghast at his behavior. The two have some edgy family scenes.Still this is one really great episodes of TNG especially after one of the tribe

In my view, sci-fi is about taking an issue be it moral, ethical, social, etc. and creating a medium where we can think about and discuss that issue outside of our preconceptions. ST:TNG ""Half a Life"" is one that immediately comes to mind. ST ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"" is also very good with ST:VOY ""Living Witness"" (too preachy) and ST:VOY ""Critical Care"" (conveniently sidesteps the issue) being examples of not-as-good.In the end, ""Sub Rosa"" is about the gray area that can exist with regards to drug use and addiction.

This is the thought that Crusher is left to consider at the end of the episode.So that's the question.

The inhabitants are some of the worst clichés of an outsiders' view of Scotland that anybody who has even visited the Highlands will find laughable. The story itself is just about okay but the attempt to mix a Gothic ghost story with science fiction doesn't quite work; it is hard to believe that Beverly would be seduced so easily or that her colleagues wouldn't have noticed that something was wrong sooner. On the plus side the problems with the weather do provide some genuinely funny moments when the bridge starts filling with fog. Overall a rather disappointing episode.",5

My wife didn't hate it quite as much as me, but she thought the show was indeed inferior.Beverly Crusher goes home to a colony where she grew up in order to attend her grandmother's funeral. Here, you learn she's of Scottish descent--which is odd as it was never mentioned before or after. It all seemed very contrived as soon she was caught up in what was a Gothic Scottish romance combined with a paranormal story. While this combination MIGHT work, putting it in outer space and on this series was awfully bad. What follows is a ghost-like story along with LOTS of heaving bosoms and perplexing romance. All in all, it was just god- awful and Gates McFadden didn't do much to help this story.UPDATE: By the way, it isn't just me who hated this episode. At the 50th anniversary Star Trek convention in Las Vegas, this was voted as one of the 10 worst of all episodes from every Trek franchise! That is some ignoble designation!",2

13,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Sub Rosa (TV Episode 1994)",Among TNG's absolute worst,"There are so many ridiculous issues with this episode, it's not even funny. The main issues arise with it taking strong, established characters and throwing everything out the window, particularly the strong female characters of Crusher and Troi. Beyond the fact that this story is out of place and feels completely tacked on, the characters act so counter to everything we've learned about them over the previous six years. What logic exists for how Crusher can not just be so easily overpowered into succumbing to some odd entity but allows herself so easily to slip into such an absurd fantasy situation. And Troi just kind of lets it all go, like she doesn't have any misgivings or Betazoid intuitions? ""Oh, you got turned on by your GRANDMOTHER'S WRITINGS? Don't see an issue there."" It's asinine. The only explanation offered for such a sudden and dramatic change is ghosts. Seriously. Ghosts. Asinine. Yes, weird, supernatural things occur all of the time on the Enterprise, but through it all, the characters remain true to themselves. That is the difference. Here, they don't. They completely abandon themselves, and there is no excuse for that. The writer attempted to shoehorn characters into a contrived narrative, a poorly forged story, and the only way to make that work was to make the characters into something opposite from what we know them as. Honestly, I'd youre watching TNG for the first time, skip this episode and go to the next one, which is so much better than this one. This is one of the true low points of the entire series.",3
14,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Sub Rosa (TV Episode 1994)",What you get when you combine Star Trek with a romance novel...,"At first this episode comes off as a romance novel with mysterious candles, ghosts, a gothic yet picturesque Scottish setting, and an exploration of sex from a female perspective. This last element is the most interesting, the rest is actually rather stupid and more 3/10 territory, especially a rather tacky resurrection sequence. The first thirty minutes or so will have you thinking ""there is no plot here"", and that is sort of true, apart from an 800 year old ""ghost"" trying to seduce Beverly Crusher, nothing actually happens apart from some whacky weather. The romance elements are rather predictable in all honesty and the idea of combining the genre with space opera is really a matter of personal taste, which might be why so many people find this thing plain awful. What salvages the episode is its treatment of female sexuality, utilizing Crusher and to a lesser extent her conversations with Troi.

A semi-gothic ghost story in outer space, with Dr Crusher getting all hot and bothered. In my more caustic moments I have been known to describe the less riveting TNG episodes as 'a bit like social work in outer space' but this is something different again. This episode sits incongruously alongside the usual TNG fare, so naturally some fans will just hate it. On the other hand the few 10/10 reviews each have their reasons. According to one, if you happen not to like it, that would be an attack on female sexuality.  I found it moderately interesting but not especially compelling; since there are plenty of TNG episodes that are like that (if you try enough slightly different things there are bound to be a few that fall flat) then it shouldn't come as a massive disappointment if you happen not to like it.in point of fact a few things did irritate me, but they were not the ones you might expect; first there is a character that has an accent that I can only describe as belonging to an Irishman who has been told to talk a bit Scottish; a more mangled sound you have never heard. Second when someone is attacked and they fall over, they are immediately declared 'dead' with no attempt whatsoever made to resuscitate them. Very un-TNG, that. It isn't explained how the Howard family line even came to be; the candidates are alien incest or more than one relationship, I suppose.
There also isn't much of a sub-plot in this episode; I thought that such things were almost compulsory.
Maybe I read it wrong, but the other gravestone (other than the one that says 'McFly') appeared to me like it might read 'Nadir'; I didn't think it was that bad, but for some this would sum up this episode nicely.",5

Because I felt strongly about the comments from the other reviewers and did not feel the writers deserve to be disparaged by such negative reviews for what I thought was a worthwhile episode.I'm male and I actually enjoyed this episode very much. Of course, there was a suspension of disbelief necessary but that's true of all sci-fi (TNG included).What I enjoyed the most was the setting/production design (I've been to Scotland and it is a magical place), as well as what I considered to be a thought-provoking ending which raised some interesting questions about the nature of love and the meaning of relationships.In any stage form, whether it be theater or television, the best stories/episodes are the ones that touch you in a unique way. This episode was definitely one of those.Anyway, kudos to the production team as well as the writing team. In my opinion, they all deserve some long overdue praise.",8

Nothing is more offensive than to create something and have that creation attributed to someone else.Now, the basic story may contain elements similar to the Anne Corn Wheat Rice story, but this Ep has nothing to do with VampyreGhostLycans and things of that nature. Although it does deal with the Supernatural, in the case of Star Trek: The Next Generation, all things Supernatural are also Scientific and, most importantly, Speculative.This Episode has to do with Scotland... With the bloodlines of the Women of that land, tracing Dr. Beverly Crusher down through the ages to the Howard Women of that land, possibly to Mary Stuart herself. And so this puts Cheryl ""Gates"" McFadden in the same Limelight as other famous redheads, including Katherine Hepburn herself.The look of the Ep is very Non-Trek, they used a location that was very much Scotland. A Whole Planet Scotland! This is what is wonderful about Trek, because somewhere in the cosmos, is a whole planet Ireland, and a whole planet Africa (This was explored in the first season episode ""Code of Honour"" and the planet Ligon II) - And so, just for this Ep, we have a whole planet of Moors, and Crags, and we can envision Clan Macloud eventually settling there.I agree there are some Religious overtones here, but they are represented as Tradition, during Felisa Howard's funeral.Now, as a Trek Ep, we already knew that Ronin was not a Ghost. Ronin was a good name for the Character, although not an Unemployed and Honour-less Samurai, pretending he is a Ghost. But the speculation of what he actually is, the kind of Life Form he is, and that he had lived with Crusher's ForeMothers through the Ages, is just interesting.This Episode expresses Regret, because after all that happens and the decision Beverly has to make, we see after all she regretted having to take that step. And that we share that feeling of loss at the end, makes this Episode one of the best of the series, and certainly an example of a well written Trek story.

Here's a news flash, boys (because I'm guessing it's 100% males who've written these awful reviews of this episode): If a guy I'm ""dating"" ever has the nerve to go ask a guy I used to ""date"" for permission to ""date"" me, guess what? Them two can jolly well go ""date"" each other, 'cause I ain't no damn pink slip for a car that they can pass between them with a dollar bill and a notary public seal.yes, this episode showed Beverly enjoying herself - a lot - and often. Women's sexuality is dismissed and subjugated and forbidden and looked on askance in the US's Puritan-centric society. Women aren't supposed to succeed, in any area, even their own sexuality. Don't believe me? Look at the champions at the Brasil Olympics these past two weeks: they were women, but their men (husbands, fathers, coaches) got all the credit for the women's incredible accomplishments. One woman didn't even get her NAME mentioned when she medaled - she was headlined as ""the wife of a Chicago Bear""!Well, tough, boys. Real men support real women and their interests. Beverly is a real woman, with real feelings - including sexual ones. Too bad you don't like seeing a woman enjoy herself.Brava (that's right, NOT BravO) for this episode. Loved it. So did most women Trek fans, but y'all don't really want to hear that, do you?I feel sorry for the women in your lives.If you don't like this episode, don't watch it.

This lead to some very poor quality control in what scripts were accepted.. It was submitted by a totally unknown script consultant who ripped off a very bad Ann Rice story about Scotland and an incubus like creepy ghost.That's some horrible quality control. if you've never seen this, don't waste you time.

As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 07The seventh act of the series seemed like an overstretched material where the writers were clearly running out of ideas, although to balance it properly, there are few brilliant concepts that defines the ingenious of Star Trek.Sub RosaMaybe the heart is in the right place with few good noted involved, but this sentiment is clearly not traveling well to the audience, the performance is put to test and McFadden delivers for the most part of it but it's a drop in the ocean.",

1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Lower Decks (TV Episode 1994)",New recruits that brought a little TOS charm with them,"'Lower Decks' is in my top 5 favorite Star Trek Next Gen episodes. A must-see ep for everyone. There were several things that made Lower Decks work, IMO.The first thing they did right was instant characterization of these new recruits. This was something TOS did well. On any given episode, if you heard Scotty say a line, you knew that he was a hard-working, extremely capable, slightly cantankerous, individual. If you heard Spock say a line, you knew he was a very intelligent, scientifically-minded, misfit. If you heard Chekhov say something, you knew he was a plucky, young, happy-go-lucky type. Whenever they showed up on the screen, we fell in love with them (again). (Aside: I think this is one reason why JJ chose to use the TOS characters for the ST reboot films, rather than the characters from any other incarnation of Trek.) The characters in TNG, by contrast, were less well-defined, and less distinct from each other. We eventually learned who they were, but it had to happen over the course of many episodes (seasons, even).The Lower Decks recruits had a little of that TOS magic in that, every scene we saw them in, they revealed who they were and made us fall in love with them. When we saw Sam Lavelle trying to hobnob with Riker and mistakenly calling him a Canadian, we knew that this was a kid with big plans, he was gonna go places, he was a bit of a brown-noser, and boy was he wet behind the ears. When we saw Taurik's cold, dry, wit when addressing the ""roommate"" issue, we knew that this was an irritating, cynical, cold-blooded individual who didn't care what other people thought of him. (The head-butting between Lavelle & Taurik also reminded us of the similar, uneasy, relationship between Spock & McCoy, which made me reminisce.) When we saw Sito Jaxa sparring blindfolded with Worf, we learned that this was a young girl who wanted to prove herself, and wasn't easily duped. At last, she did get a chance to prove herself by helping the Cardassian to return in the escape pod. We were saddened at her loss along with the rest of the Enterprise crew when Picard announced she had been killed.Another thing LD did well was giving everyone a chance in the spotlight. This is a hard thing to do with a large, ensemble, cast. They did it well in ST4 by giving every member of the crew a job they needed to do to help get a humpback whale back to the future. The three young recruits all had their individual moments (Taurik with La Forge in engineering, Lavelle with Riker, Jaxa sparring with Worf), and their occasional ""come togethers"" (playing poker midway through the ep, sitting together in Ten-Forward remembering Jaxa at the end). It also helped that in their individual/""spotlight"" scenes, they connected with a TNG crewmember that we already knew and could foil off of them.It's just a pity that these recruits didn't become the cast of Voyager.",10

There is a sub plot to this and Ensign Sito played with style by Shannon Fill is picked on by Picard because of a misdemeanor a couple of years before this in the Academy which resulted in the death of a cadet. When Worf, who sees real potential in Sito gives her a wake up call she confronts Picard and he is pleased that she had the courage to come forth and stand up for herself. When he explains that he needs a Bajoran officer for a special mission into Cardassian space she quickly volunteers.

And it turns out that Sam and Sito are up for the same job! An intriguing episode because we get to see how others on the Enterprise handle themselves - especially those struggling to get ahead with their careers and what is necessary to do so.Trivia note: again, Riker and Troi work together on the crew evaluation reports (the last time they did so was 3 months ago).

It was excellent to see how the lower ranks (decks) reacted to what those above them are doing, and how the upper ranks react to what the lower decks do. Ensign Sito Jaxa was a favorite character and I really wish she would have returned or her fate determined over on DS9. She would have been a welcome addition (and perhaps a foil/protégé for Kira). I would have rather seen TNG go onto another season rather than go onto the big screen. All in all, this is one of the best episodes TNG ever did. It's too bad they didn't do more episodes showing what was going on with the lower ranks. (or that it took until O'Brien was on DS9 to give him his own pips).",10

Across the room four young ensigns look on wondering how things are going for them. As the episode progresses we see these characters interacting with members of the main cast; Dr Crusher tells Nurse Ogawa that her promotion is virtually in the bag; Taurik, a Vulcan, appears to irritate Geordi with his ideas for improving efficiency, Sam Lavelle is convinced that Riker has got it in for him and Sito Jaxa is championed by Worf. It is the last of these characters who proves to be most important; she appeared before in 'The First Duty' and Picard tells her that he thought she should have been thrown out of Star Fleet for her part in the events of that episode it later transpires that this dressing down was part of a test to see whether she had the backbone to stand up for herself when unfairly treated. When she passes she is invited to take part in a top secret, and potentially very dangerous, mission that requires a Bajoran to play the part of a Cardassian prisoner.This is a superior season seven episode; the way it concentrates as much of junior characters as well as the main cast shows us another side of life on the Enterprise; instead of concentrating on those already in important positions it shows us those still struggling to be noticed and get a chance for promotion. It is fun to see how each of them deals with the situation and when the later plot involving Ensign Sito's mission it is interesting to see how they deal with the fact that they can't talk to their friends about everything anymore; being able to keep secrets from those closest to them is just part of the job. The way the junior officers activities mirror their seniors in handled well; we see both groups relaxing in Ten Forward and at other times playing poker. The cast do a fine job with the guest stars holding their own amongst the established cast; this is particularly true of Shannon Fill who puts in a sensitive performance as Sito as she has to deal with some rather unconventional tests prior to her mission.

And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 07The seventh act of the series seemed like an overstretched material where the writers were clearly running out of ideas, although to balance it properly, there are few brilliant concepts that defines the ingenious of Star Trek.Lower DecksA brilliant idea something that the series House (Hugh Laurie) used to do too, with a new perspective on display the writing has to up the game in order to not let the storytelling feel like news, fortunately they live up to their avant-garde vision.",
0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Thine Own Self (TV Episode 1994)",Data loses his memory and Troi seeks promotion,"This episode has two, entirely separate, story lines; on the Enterprise Lt. Commander Troi finds Beverly on duty on the bridge and starts to wonder about applying for promotion to Commander herself. This won't be easy; not only are the exams rigorous they are also administered by Riker it might not be easy to be judged by a friend. Meanwhile Data is on a relatively primitive planet to retrieve radioactive parts from a crashed probe. Something has gone wrong though and he finds himself in a local village having lost his memory. Having no notion of beings from other worlds the locals quickly decide that he must be an 'Ice Man' as he comes from the north. He is befriended by Garvin and his daughter Gia, who gives him the name 'Jayden'. He pays his way with the radioactive metal fragments he was carrying and soon people start getting ill. He retains enough knowledge to research a cure but his task is made harder by a group of frightened natives who think he is the direct cause of their illness.Of the two stories shown in this episode Data's is by far the more interesting; having him lose his memory in the way he did created an interesting situation as it meant his ignorance about the metal he was carrying is understandable but still had the scientific reasoning to find the cure. The community he visited was fairly typical of the series; a small community that is fairly friendly but also blames the outsider as soon as things go wrong. Brent Spiner does a fine job portraying Data; while he is noticeably not his normal self he is only subtly different in the way he behaves he still works logically through the problem and doesn't ignore the possibility that he may be the cause. Troi's story seems more of a time filler but it isn't without merit; there are some enjoyable scenes between Marina Sirtis and Jonathan Frakes, as Troi's tests are supervised by Riker. The ending of this story was a little disappointing; Troi gains promotion when she realises that command may involve ordering people to certain death it would have been more interesting if she had declined to promotion when she realised this it would be nice to have a main character acknowledge that there are somethings they can't do rather than learning they can do whatever is required. Overall though a pretty good episode.",8

Now he enters a village near the crash site . . . bringing the radioactive material with him! Soon the village starts suffering from radiation poisoning, and the frightened townspeople start blaming Data.At the same time on the Enterprise, seeing how Dr. Crusher is again in command of the Enterprise, Troi, after coming back from her school reunion, decides she wants to be a Commander too and takes the rigorous tests necessary.Another intriguing episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation.Trivia note: Riker plays the trombone again, as well as mentioning Troi as his ""Imzadi"". Troi mentions how she started thinking about being a Commander ever since the ""Disaster"" episode 2 years ago.",
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Thine Own Self (TV Episode 1994)",Lost Data.,"When this episode begins, Data is on some planet collecting parts of a radioactive probe that landed there. He is sure to avoid the locals, as they are, roughly, at about the medieval/renaissance level in their development. However, when he is injured, Data cannot remember who he is and eventually he wanders into town. The locals, however, cannot conceive of anyone not from their world and instead of freaking out at this weird being, they just assume he's 'from the north'. Unfortunately, Data is also carrying radioactive material and the locals begin passing the metal around--with alarming consequences.At the same time this is occurring, Troi is on the Enterprise trying to improve her skills and become a bridge officer. However, her 'niceness' mind be a serious impairment, as sometimes a captain needs to make decisions that can kill.I didn't particularly care much about the Troi plot. This isn't to say it was bad, but the Data loss part of the show was much more compelling. Overall, despite the show running seven seasons, this is a very good program--and even though Picard (Patrick Stewart) was barely in the show.",8

Although Troi is now a full Commander and Data still a Lieutenant Commander, Data still outranks her by virtue of being the ships Second Officer. The line of command would be 1. Captian Picard 2. Commander Riker 3. Lt Commander Data. Otherwise Data would already have been outranked by Dr. Crusher who is also a full Commander. And merely passing the test would probably not necessarily warrant a promotion or La Forge, who is already passed, would most likely be a Commander by now with his superior experience. It always kinda bugged me the way they involved Crusher and Troi in operations of the ship they'd have no reason to be involved with. Tactical and strategic planning would be out of their field.",7
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Thine Own Self (TV Episode 1994)",Data Lost,"Something has happened to Data as he appears, with a sort of unexplained amnesia, in a pre-industrial culture that bears a resemblance to a medieval village. His appearance makes him the target of superstitious residents but endears him to a kind man and his daughter. Unfortunately, as he entered the town, he cluelessly hands over a case that contains radioactive metals. People begin to get sick and Data is blamed. He begins to work on a cure because while he can't get all his memory back, he seems to have maintained his scientific knowledge. He comes to realize that he is the true cause of the sickness and associates it with the metals he has given for a small price to a metalworker. One the Enterprise, Deanna has begun to feel she has reached a dead end and begins to study to move up to Commander in rank. Apparently, it doesn't take much to attend the bridge in a position of authority. This subplot aside, I find this a really well thought out piece of science fiction.",9
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Thine Own Self (TV Episode 1994)",Data and Troi define themselves,"In the case of Data in that a bombardment of radiation has crashed his Positronic Net. For Troi in that she has decided to become a Bridge Officer and will take the Command test.It becomes clear that only Data's short term memory and identity have been affected, not his ability to learn and adapt. In ""Eye of the Beholder"" Data tells Geordi that when faced with a choice between erasing his Brain or letting his brain adapt naturally to his upper data storage limit of ""800 quadrillion bits (100,000 TB)"" and possibly Malfunctioning, he chose the latter despite the risk. In this episode, the former has appeared to have happened: His Brain seems to have been erased.But it appears that Data still has the experience he garnered in the years since his activation: He knows that various combinations of Elements comprise Matter, and that objects don't really have ""Fire/Air/Water or Earth"" in them simply because they are hot, or a Liquid, or are a Vapor or are hard like a stone. He also has his rational, reasoning mind and his ability for Language- Even though he has forgotten the Context of his language.Because he has forgotten the context of the word ""Radioactive"" a dangerous material gets distributed into a Pre-Industrial colony of people, a people who although are interested in the Scientific Method, have not quite learned how to discard their religious and spiritual biases.And it is making these people ill, and the more ill they get, the more fear and loathing they have for ""Jaden"" who they have labeled as an ""Iceman"" - Using the Label as a derogatory reference and the De-Facto cause of their ills.Meanwhile, Troi is able to pass the basic menial parts of the test, but she can't seem to get one particular aspect of Command - One which she had been forced to grapple with in the 5th season, 5th Episode ""Disaster"" and she was the highest ranking living Bridge officer left, forced to take command. In fact it was that very ""Disaster"" that had caused Troi to seek the Bridge Officer's test, so why can't she remember the basic tenet of Command which she had to face back then?The answer is in her face, but because she is not really in that situation while being tested, it eludes her, until she catches on to Riker's Clue about the First Duty of a Commander.Data himself has to face a test of the same sort, only in his case, he uses the inverse of the solution to the Bridge Officer's test, or rather he applies that solution to himself.Down on the planet where ""Data/Jaden"" is, there is a feast of great Character Actors: Mike Hagerty is ""Skoran"" - You will remember Mike from ""Redemption, part II"" as the ""Piece of Bak-Tag"" that tried to kill Worf and Kurn, but who Kurn evaporated using a warp-induced Solar Flare. Same kind of guy here. Ronnie Claire Edwards aka "" Corabeth Walton"" in The Waltons is Talur, a Teacher who claims 'Scientific Method' but who in fact uses Witchcraft to explain her world and how it works. But the best, is Kimberly Cullum as ""Gia"" - Another little girl who gets attached to Data like Sarjenka (Nikki Cox) in Season 2 ""Pen Pals"".These character and child actors were the life's blood of The Next Generation. Used in this episode, they create a Trek ""Planet"" episode that is realistic and believable. And once again Data saves a Little Girl and her whole town, but in this case, he is the one who gets his memory wiped of the incident. So in a way, this episode bookends ""Pen Pals"" in both the A and B story- Troi is the one extending her limits as Wesley was in Pen Pals, and Data once again defies the Prime Directive to save a girl he cares for, although he will not remember it.",10

It really shows how the Holodeck makes these tests not destroy physical simulations as shown in ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"".The thing that really strikes me as odd here is how the town's doctor seems both respectful and dismissive of Data at the same time.",

According to the plot Data lands on a planet without first contact to retreat a radioactive rock

despite his strange (to say the least) appearance. But they get sick due to
some contamination from the radioactivity and even with a memory loss
Data must have that prime directive somewhere in his memory banks that

training to be a bridge officer. I have to say seeing Counselor Troi on the
bridge for 7 seasons one would have thought she was qualified already.Not one of the better episodes as TNG heads for a wrap up.",4

I cannot imagine Picard ordering Laforge to go and die, just like that. And I have trouble imagining Laforge obeying that order.

They start by transporting artifacts and then use Data as a conduit to express their purposes. Why go through this whole complex procedure. Why not just do their will. Data begins to exhibit multiple personalities and Picard carries on discourse with him in an attempt to figure out what is going on. At least the Captain has been shown to be a true student of archaeology, a cosmic interpreter of mythology, an intergalactic Joseph Campbell. This gives him some sort of credibility. However, the whole thing bogs down when the creature/creatures become true forces. The solution is so simplistic. The conclusion is the worst of any episode I've seen. Watch at your own risk, although Brent Spiner is quite wonderful with his use of voices and his physicality. His Commander Data is one of the most entertaining and creative characters in all of science fiction.",4
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Masks (TV Episode 1994)",Not the worst-- but damn close!,"Some are comparing this episode to ""Sub Rosa"", but for me the nadir of the series has always been ""The Neutral Zone"", an episode where literally *nothing* happens. I can't rate this one as worse, but it gives it a good run for its money. At least this episode *has* a plot. But you can search high and low and never find one with a plot that makes less sense.Let us summarize: some giant alien space probe with super-advanced technology that well outstrips that of our heroes starts *slowly* transforming the Enterprise into a model of its home world, while filling Data with the personalities of its *primitive* religion. Our heroes must stop it from doing this before the ship is completely transformed and they, presumably, die (no life-support systems or anything). Data's personalities gradually reveal some kind of vague story about the sun god killing everyone because the moon good is inexplicably absent to keep her in check. So in the end Picard decides to role play the moon god, and, voilà!, the probe instantly puts the ship back to normal.And the reason that the aliens built a probe to do *that* is....?Take your time trying to come up with a plausible reason. You won't find one.And by the way, what would have happened if it had been the U.S.S. Lollipop that had wandered by instead of the Enterprise, which did not conveniently sport an android among its crew? With no android to play the parts of the probe's various characters, what happens then? How are the Lollipop's crew supposed to solve the ridiculous ""puzzle"" that the probe requires in order to not destroy the ship?This episode is a bad crossing of ""The Inner Light"" with ""The Royale"". At least in ""The Royale"", they provide a plausible explanation of *why* it is necessary to act out the fiction to the end.Yes, as someone else stressed, Brent Spiner gives an excellent performance as all those alien personalities. But this is balanced by the rest of the crew being simply *awful* as a bunch of inept and impotent losers. Only Picard has *any* idea of anything to do, and all of his ideas ridiculously involve trying to solve the alien personalities' problems rather than his own. That is to say, *his* problem was never Masaka, it was the alien probe! By any logic, he ought to have been concentrating on doing something to disable or escape the probe. He had absolutely no way to know that putting on a mask and role-playing some mythical god figure would make the probe somehow magically put the ship back together again.It is my natural inclination to focus on plot problems, and this episode has more than its share. But I would not want to give the impression that that is the only problem with this episode. The writing is terrible. Some of the dialog is just painfully bad. Wince- inducing.This is an episode that just gets worse with each viewing. I admit that the first time I saw it, while I didn't rate it highly, I didn't realize how awful it is.

The emotional struggle, between the competing personalities was also portrayed in a believable way.It's been a while since I have watched this episode, so I can't go into more detail about the story-line... but reading the negative reviews, I felt I had to say something in its defense.Spiner's performance in this episode has always stayed with me!",8

If they could have built that, why not build a spaceship to carry them away? It seemed like a lot of the parts of the episode were cut out - in the other episodes there were much better explanations of what went on. In this episode they really skipped out on explaining the significance of the characters Data played - names that ihat was the comet, masaka as a star going supernova (at least, that is what it seemed like to me), her father as the discarded remains, etc. I just wish they had taken more time to explain it.",8

But if we can be honest about this particular episode, then this show was lacking in so many ways. And after watching the episode on two occasions, this was more about the many acting abilities of Brent Spiner than an entertaining view by the public.When the Enterprise investigates a passing comet they find inside a mysterious religion facility deep inside the comet. Somehow the passing facility invades the Enterprise's computers plus Data's computer mind making the facility able to communicate with the crew by means of several strange characters that are projected through Data's computer brain. While the Enterprise is being transformed into a ancient alien city, Data's computer mind will hold the key to how Captain Picard can communicate with the forces that are holding the Enterprise.Brent Spiner did his best at playing several characters but it was not enough to make the story interesting. In fact it was distracting seeing Data change into so many characters in which some had no relevance to the on-going problem the crew was facing.Thinking I may have missed some important information during my first view, I watch the episode for a second time. Much to my chagrin the second viewing was worse than the first. Nothing had been missed. This was an uninteresting and confusing story that had little action and even less sense.

I've seen some things that have made me roll my eyes, but nothing as bad as this episode (yes, Dr. Crusher's episode ""Sub Rosa"" was pretty dumb, but her sexiness cancels out much of the dumbness.).In this episode a floating alien library starts turning the Enterprise into an Aztec/Mayan temple. This is done through the ships computer, so Data is also affected. Data get's multiple personality disorder and becomes a couple of members of this ancient culture. Picard talks to these personalities for clues on how to stop the ancient goddess. (As an aside, there is a scene where only 20% of the Enterprise is still left ""unchanged"". The big 4: Picard, LaForge, Riker, Troi, are trying to decide whether or not to enter a certain symbol into the computer. Hello?! The Enterprise is almost completely transformed into a frickin' temple! Is there an alternative?) In the end, Data becomes the sun goddess (yes, a goddess). Picard puts on a mask of the moon god and convinces Data (as the sun goddess) that she is tired and must ""relinquish the sky"" to the moon god so the ""hunted may become the hunter"" and the hunt can continue. Data agrees, and everything goes back to normal.Picture Picard wearing a Halloween mask. Patrick Stewart is a great actor, and I enjoy watching him perform, but I was laughing AT him in this episode. Ugh! This is not an episode that I need to watch again ... ever.Picard, out.PS - This is a pretty scathing review. So why did I give it a 4?

The writing was so bad that I had look away at times and the plot was just plain stupid. Why would someone create a station like that in space and to what purpose? But the worst thing with this episode is the stupidity of Picard. He is supposed to have studied ancient cultures but he does not get that it is the moon that can put the sun to sleep.

More and more parts of the Enterprise are converted into what looks like a South American temple; if they are to stop the entire ship changing they will have to find 'Masaka' and then discover how to make her leave.Despite all the negative reviews I rather enjoyed this episode although I can see why others didn't. I liked the idea of the archives of an ancient culture being hidden within a very old comet and there was a sense of mystery as various artefacts started appearing on the Enterprise. The highlight though was seeing Data possessed by various personalities the always reliable Brent Spiner excels here as he gets to show a greater than usual acting range. The way he warns that 'Masaka is coming' was rather creepy even if every time Masaka was mentioned I though the name sounded too like 'Moussaka'! The ending was a bit disappointing as the Enterprise reverts to normal almost instantly once Masaka is dealt with. Overall the episode may not be perfect but it is far from the worst episode and if nothing else it is worth watching to see Data's various possessing personalities.,7
13,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Masks (TV Episode 1994)","Not the greatest, but still worth a watch.","After such a great run of episodes in seasons 5 to the 16th episode of the seventh and final season of TNG, this 17th episode was rather lackluster. The plot (the Enterprise is, essentially, taken over and transformed into an ancient culture) lacks the depth we've come to expect from the latter seasons' episodes.However, I will *not* suggest the casual viewer to skip this episode, and it is also the reason for my generous 7/10 rating.Quite simply, it is worth a watch for Brent Spiner's performance. In the episode, Data suffers similar effects as the Enterprise, only he is taking the personalities of ancient people. Several personalities, which Spiner seamlessly transitions into in a way that seems so natural and effortless. It is truly a pleasure to watch. Brent Spiner is quite the actor, and it was refreshing to see him show his stuff!It is truly worth the watch for his performance alone, and it is a shame they couldn't develop the plot to match his dynamic. It it had been, this could have easily been one of the best episodes, instead of the opposite.",7

Here, the same idea is repeated with much less satisfying results. Part of it is because it is just a copy and part of it is because the show didn't seem to do much with what it did.When the show begins, the Enterprise finds a rogue meteor flying through the galaxy. Within is found a structure--and soon weird stuff starts happening on the ship. Odd objects appear and Data becomes possessed. Soon, more objects appear on-board and the ship appears to be transforming into a ship for this alien species. Can they stop this?The transformations and Data's weird possession seemed pretty threatening but were dealt with amazingly easily. And, who and why this occurred is straight from ""The Inner Light"" but done with so little finesse that I just recommend you see that earlier episode and skip this one.",5

other than Brent Spiner was being inhabited by a lot of personalities.The Enterprise discovers a rogue comet in their path. But when they burn off
the space debris accumulated over 87 million years by Data's reckoning it's
discovered to be some kind of archive of a long dead civilization. The personalities of which start inhabiting Data.Not only that but the ship starts being transformed into that civilization that
died so long ago. A great find for amateur archaeologist Patrick Stewart, but
Captain Picard always knows his first duty is to his ship and crew.I have to confess I got lost during the telling of this rather murky tale. Not
one of the better TNG's of the last or any other season.",4

Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works.

Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily.

In fact, she finds out that Kwan didn't seem like the type to take his own life, and soon she is flooded with empathic memories from the Utopia Planitia shipyards WHEN the Enterprise was built 8 years ago!How is Kwan's death and Troi's memories related? Find out what happened and will happen!Trivia note: Starfleet gives its okay for the Enterprise to exceed the Warp Speed limitations that were established in ""Force Of Nature"".

Initial investigations show no obvious reasons for him to end his life; in fact everything suggests that he was happy and his life was going well. The pair return to the point where his death occurred and as Troi stands where he stood; she suddenly feels dizzy then sees the room as it was when the ship was being built. During this dizzy spell she sees a woman being attacked, the face of a red-haired man and a couple embracing who start laughing at her. When she comes to she wonders if something terrible happened in the room back when the Enterprise was built which left some sort empathic echo as the man who killed himself was also partially empathetic.This episode was a little disappointing mostly due to the fact that it ultimately becomes that most of what we have seen is part of a telepathic vision rather than anything that really happened even if the case is solved in that vision is was disappointing. This also meant that Troi's night with Worf never happened clearly the writers want to tease the viewers about that possible relationship. If this doesn't bother you the mystery of what happened during the ship's construction is fairly interesting and the 'red-haired man' is rather creepy.The fact that Capt. Picard stated that this was the first suicide on the ship and the fact that ultimately the man who killed himself did so because his telepathic abilities made him live through another man's crime rather than a more usual reason meant the episode failed to deal with any real issues concerning suicide something rather surprising given how 'Star Trek' has dealt with many real issues over the years.",6

And in this case we have a suicide, by Lt Kwan, and she is set to investigate so the family can have some answers. And during her investigation she has an empathic experience about an event that happened many years ago as the Enterprise was being built. So now we get story where Deanna, by her telepathic powers, can view into the future and possibly solve a mystery of why the young Lt. Kwan committed suicide.We all know that the writers try their best to spread the story-lines so that each character is featured in at least one or two episodes a season. And I feel sure that writing for Marina Sirtis character is difficult. But in this story it goes far overboard making her telepathic powers and the following story confusing and bothersome. At the end of the episode it gets all summed up by a play on words that is difficult to understand. When the reason for the suicide and other actions are revealed, it all seems so made-up that the story was for naught. An otherwise nice story that seemed rush to conclusion. This is one time the ending ruined the story.",4

The plots revolves around telepathic abilities, one of my least favorite aspects of the Star Trek universe. I like my science fiction at least somewhat grounded in science rather than pseudo-science. I grudgingly accept Troi's abilities when presented as extremely sharp intuition but when presented more like a true psychic ability I can't help but be skeptical. The plot is something of a who-done-it. I don't want to discuss the details because they aren't very interesting. But I can say that the ending is poorly scripted.

In the process, she witnesses what appears to be a rape/murder and she seems to see this from the rapist's perspective. Worf is paired with Deanna and during this time a romantic relationship develops between them. It seems that something happened at the time the Enterprise was being constructed. The problem with the episode is that there are some issues with what is real and how the characters ultimately react to those implications.

This ultimately leads to their romance, one of the better, late story-lines of the series.Unfortunately, it's hard to decide what's more annoying - the poor acting of the officer's fiancée (who apparently called it quits after '00, mercifully) or the clunky dialogue, surprisingly written by series wunderkind Rene Echevarria. Deanna and Worf's first love scene in particular seems to come out of left field, and ruins what would otherwise be a great one, with its intriguing plot and en medea res opening.

0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Genesis (TV Episode 1994)",Badly executed plot supported by terrible science,"I can't decide whether this or ""Sub Rosa"" is the worst episode of the season.Honestly, who thought that this story would be entertaining in any way? In addition to having plot holes big enough to fly the Enterprise through (e.g. Where was Alexander during all this? If the disease started in sickbay, why are Worf and Troi the first to be affected? When did Spot get a sex change?), it simply wasn't very interesting to watch, unless you enjoy seeing the regular actors wearing ridiculous make-up shot with cheap-horror-movie lighting. And because this is a reset-button story where nothing that happens will have any consequences on the characters (even the final scene mocks the notion that the previous 44 minutes happened), this episode really has nothing going for it.And now I'm going to be self-indulgent and pick apart the ""science"" of the show, because I feel like it. Let's start with the term ""de-evolving"". No. Just no. The term is ""devolving"". Of course using the correct term would not have saved the science. If something causes your DNA to change, you will die. Period. And the notion that a T-Cell did it is even more ludicrous because T-Cells are about 4,000 times larger than DNA strands. Writer Brannon Braga obviously did SOME research in an attempt to make his idea halfway believable, but it was not nearly enough. Seriously, why bother with all this pseudo-scientific gobbledygook that doesn't even make sense within its own framework, much less in any plausible vision of the future? Why not just say a ""magic potion"" transformed everyone into creatures and back again? It would still have been bad, but at least a little less tedious.If you are not a Trekkie and you see this episode, please don't judge the series or the franchise by it. At least see a classic episode like ""Lower Decks"" or ""The Best of Both Worlds"" before making up your mind.",2
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Genesis (TV Episode 1994)",Star Trek TNG 'Genesis'. Brilliantly stupid.,"This episode is retarded. The writer of Genesis, Brannon Braga, clearly has little-to-no knowledge of Biology. Piccard, Riker, and Barclay are all clearly human, yet Riker turns into a proto-human, and Barclay turns into a spider? Spot, the cat, a mammal, mutates entirely into an Iguana? Genesis is probably campier than most of the original series.That said, this is without a doubt among my favorite TNG episodes. TNG was a fantastic series, with some great, complex story arcs, but compared to the original, it maybe took itself a bit too seriously for a show about people who time-travel and fight aliens. Genesis was clearly a slight horror-movie spoof, with the crew slowly going mad, before out-right changing into ""de-evolved"" (not ""devolved"") versions of themselves, leaving Data to figure out wtf is going on, while Piccard begins to show symptoms himself, while a savage-super- venom-spitting-Worf takes out Crusher with his savage-super-venom and tries to hunt down Troi, and have bitey, and probably lethal savage-super-sex.It's a ridiculous and campy plot, but it's fun and the actors get to have fun with the characters.",10

And Picard begins to exhibit the same signs! Watch what happens in this exciting episode.Dwight Schultz returns as Lt. Reginald 'Reg' Barclay III (an even more hyper version of himself).

I think all of us at one time or another, read too many Medical Journals, and have developed symptoms equivalent to things we had read about. Even so, this is Dwight Schultz' Penultimate Performance as ""Barclay"" - And his last in The Next Generation until his cameo in Star Trek: First Contact.This Ep had some great Makeup effects, very realistic. Except for Worfs feet, at 12 minutes and 23 seconds, take a look at Worf's foot, this is not a Klingon foot, we saw Worf's feet in the episode ""Ethics"". Of course Spot might not have ""Devolved"" into an Iguana, but it would not have been cost effective to use makeup on a Cat. But to see Barclay as a Spider, Riker as a Cro-Magnon man, Nurse Ogawa as a Neanderthal, and Troi as a kind of Newt-Woman (Which of course was another nod to the Alien/Aliens Universe, as there was a character named ""Newt"" in Aliens) - Was enough to satisfy my Trek Injection of the time, as I saw this Ep First-Run.The homages to Alien were done very well, especially the finding of the Shed Skin, and Worf's denting of the Sickbay Doors, and although his makeup looked more like ""Predator"" - Well, it is still an homage to Alien. There were some very startling moments in this- Two specifically I can think of, but I've put enough Spoilers into this. It is too bad the Series ended so soon after, ""Gates"" should have helmed more Eps - She mastered this one, Probably all of Riker's directing ability rubbed off on her.We can thank Braga again for this story, another one of his better ones.

While it was pretty cool seeing the cool primordial makeup on a few crew members, a few things seemed odd. Shouldn't many of the crew members have been eaten by some of the more aggressive changelings? And where is all the manure and territory that the creatures would have 'marked'?

This episode is a departure from anything philosophical or deep that the other episodes provide, and instead is just FUN. I always welcome these episodes to break up the season's tone and just do whatever they want.Sure it's not realistic, sure its got plot holes, but you know what it also has? A well-executed change of atmosphere, well directed build-up, and just a unique, Twilight Zone-esque journey through some space silliness that, at the very least, is a joy to watch the crew indulge in as its last crazy-hurrah of the season.I do not envy anyone who can't voluntarily put aside their elitist fanboy-ism of a serie's tropes and universe and just take something at face value, for they probably don't get much entertainment from much else.",

Meanwhile on the bridge a test of an 'improved' torpedo goes wrong; this leaves Worf furious with himself as he was the one who'd modified it. While Capt. Picard and Data take a shuttle to retrieve to torpedo strange things start to happen on the Enterprise. Troi starts complaining about the cold, Barclay becomes confident and Worf develops venom glands! By the time Picard and Data get back the entire crew has reverted to an atavistic state; whatever the cause it is now also affecting the captain; they will have to work fast to find the cause and a cure before he turns into a lemur!This is a rather strange episode but fun if you don't think about it too much with many characters turning into deadly predators it is odd that we only see one death. Early on it was fun seeing Dwight Schultz return as the hypochondriac Lt. Barclay as he suggests various fatal ailments he might have. As the crew start changing things are intriguing as there is no indication were it is going until Worf bites Troi the sprays Beverley with poison! Once Picard and Data get back it is clear that the crew has entirely changed and many of the ship's systems are offline; this leads to a distinctly creepy atmosphere as they here strange noises while walking through darkened corridors.

Unfortunately, the treatment results in a ship wide gene mutation to everyone on board. Picard and Data have gone on a shuttle craft mission prior to the infection and return to find the ship adrift in space. Everyone on board has mutated backwards on the evolutionary scale (Deanna to an amphibian, Barclay to a spider, Riker to a early form of hominid, Worf to a reptile form, Nurse Ogawa to a early ape, and Spot to an ""iguana"").

His fears of what is happening to his own body get played out by the virus that his own body created. A massive case of subconscious projection ?

Someone else mentioned Red Dwarf. It seems clear they parody this episode with ""Pete"" ( http://reddwarf.wikia.com/wiki/RD:_Pete_I ). The pet bird devolving into a dinosaur ?

Completely random and beyond my suspension of disbelief. It would have been much more interesting if they explored what caused the changes in his personality instead of just using it as a spring board to a big reveal.

At the same time, a moody Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton in his last Star Trek performance before Star Trek: Nemesis) is on break from Starfleet Academy, alienating everyone onboard the Enterprise.Sensing Wesley's troubled demeanor, a visiting Indian elder invites him to the Native American colony for a vision quest - a quest that will have profound repercussions for Wesley. Picard also has a connection with the Native American settlers too - a relative from his past (23 generations ago).It should be noted that this episode is a precursor to Star Trek: Voyager - more precisely Chakotay's character.Natalia Nogulich returns as Vice Admiral Alynna Nechayev (who has softened a bit here), Doug Wert as Cmdr.

Season 7 is the worst season, and episode 20, Journey's End, is the worst of the worst. There are a few other episodes that typically rank near the bottom, but for me this one takes the cake.Why? Because, out of nowhere, Wesley can stop time. And then start it again. With his mind.Yeah, you read that right. It's a completely ridiculous plot point that serves no purpose except to get rid of Wesley, which they could have done any number of ways that wouldn't have involved him stopping and starting time.If zero stars were an option, I would have given this zero stars.",1
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Journey's End (TV Episode 1994)",Stereotypes and Preachiness,"One of the silliest TNG episodes ever, although it tries to make a moral point, it's mired in bad stereotypes. Pre-American natives, referred to as ""Indians"" in the episode, are presented as ridiculous 60s cowboy movie types--something they've been complaining about since the early twentieth century. One of the other reviews suggested this episode was ""ahead of its time,"" but how can it be ahead of its time when it plays the noble savage card--outdated since the 1970s. Wesley is another example of bad stereotyping in the episode. I admit, I've grown to like his character in recent years, but this last visit from him is the absolute worst. First, he's the broody teenager cliché, then he becomes the hippie era white-kid-exploring-non-white-spiritual-culture cliché, and finally, he goes off the deep end with one of the most absurd call-backs to a previous episode ever.",3
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Journey's End (TV Episode 1994)",Wesley leaves!,"This episode is pretty stupid, though it does at least mark the end to Wesley's appearances on the show. While I assume Wil Wheaton is a lovely person in real life, I have met very few people that liked him on the show. Here, oddly, he's at his very, very worst-- insufferable in fact!The Federation has just negotiated a treaty with the Kardashian Empire*. As part of the treaty, some Federation planets will need to be evacuated and some of the Kardashians will have to do the same. This is a real problem for an ultra-bizarro group of American Indians** who are inexplicably living there. After all, I could appreciate their desire to leave Earth since folks weren't particularly nice to them in the past. But why did they need to go to THIS place way across space?! Considering how close it is to Kardashian space, this is just illogical. Speaking of illogical, there is the plot about Wesley. So much of it just doesn't make sense. First, when he comes aboard he is sullen, insufferable and nasty. While this is normal for most teens, he's supposed to be about 20 and in his final year at Starfleet Academy. He was written very poorly because he was so extremely unlikable and behaved like a boorish jerk. Second, one of the Indians** takes him on a long spirit journey to discover who he really is. And, third, this same being then tells Wesley he's ascending to a higher form of life--and in light of what an annoying idiot he's become, there is no way ANYONE could believe this!! Oh, and the one native leader is clearly wearing a long-hair wig, as you can see the seams if you look carefully!*Yes, I know they are Cardassians. My daughter calls them that and I think it's kind of cute.**What do you call these people?! I want to be nice and all politically correct and all, but you CANNOT call them 'Native Americans'. Apart from being a bit patronizing, they certainly aren't Americans since they live on a planet other than Earth. And, since they never mention which tribe they are, you cannot call them by their tribe. Just wondering what to do about this?",2
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Journey's End (TV Episode 1994)",Jar-Jar Wesley,"Wesley has always been somewhat of an Albatross for STNG.Originally a good idea-concept for a character on a Star Trek revival, the writers quickly developed an inconsistency on how to handle him in episode plots. Which quickly doomed the character to fans.Sometimes, he was a prodigy genius that saves the ship, other times a last resort subject for a script concept.Sort of a John-Boy Walton/Will Robinson type, both Lost in Space! The biggest problem I have with this character and the writers that wrote him, is that in the episode ""Journey's End"", Wesley pretty much severs all ties to Star Fleet, and leaves under circumstances that would prevent him from ever being allowed to return to Star Fleet service. Ever.That's assuming that an inter-dimensional, space-time traveling being, who can control warp fields with his mind, would ever want to join Star Fleet again in the first place.But in ST: Nemesis, Wesley is seen back in Star Fleet, again, and joining Riker on his new ship, Titan.I'm so glad the Titan series books never mention him.",5
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Journey's End (TV Episode 1994)",One Story Ends with a Blowout;; Another Begins with a Pinprick,"The most visible occurrence of this episode is the last appearance of the Wesley Crusher character. Paying close attention, we learn that this promising Starfleet whiz kid is inwardly becoming depressed at the prospect of completing his studies and becoming an officer. During a mission to relocate the residents of a Federation colony on Dorvan V which is being ceded to Cardassia, Wesley meets a mysterious Native American who encourages him to take a vision quest, revealing an image from his father Jack Crusher telling Wes not to become an officer. After committing a deliberate violation of Starfleet code of conduct, shedding his uniform and trying to intervene in a violent brawl between the colonists and arriving Cardassians, Wesley discovers the mysterious Indian is none other than The Traveler, an inter-dimensional alien whom the Enterprise crew had encountered seven years earlier, now asking Wesley to travel with him to explore other plains of existence.Though concluding Wesley's arc was important, the more important aspect of this episode is in the story of the attempt to resettle the Federation colonists from Dorvan V. This intended resettlement is the direct result of a border treaty with Cardassia, requiring them and the Federation to exchange colonies across the redrawn border. The Dorvan colonists, having spent generations being relocated in their search for a home, refuse to leave - or to be forcibly removed. The Cardassian newcomers agree to let them live undisturbed under Cardassian jurisdiction, an agreement which is destined to be short lived. In the immediate interim during Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, other colonists will refuse to be evacuated, try cutting ties with the Federation, suffer harassment by Cardassian bullies and band together to form a resistance, the Maquis. The Maquis would then play a vital role during Star Trek Voyager. And, it stems from a pinprick incident from this episode.",8
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Journey's End (TV Episode 1994)",Farewell to Wesley Crusher,As peace is established between the Federation and the Cardassians a border is established; this leaves each side with a handful of colonies on the wrong side of the line. The Enterprise is given the delicate task of relocating a colony of Native Americans; Picard argues that they have been forced to move enough times due to treaties that were forced on them but he is told they must be moved anyway by force if necessary. This mission coincides with a visit to the Enterprise by Wesley Crusher; he manages to offend people with his surly attitude and it turns out his grades at Star Fleet Academy have fallen to a point where we could fail. One of the Native Americans approaches him and tells him he has been expected; he is a little confused but agrees to go down to the planet and undertake a vision quest. During this he sees his late father and is told that he should take his own path. Shortly afterwards he alerts the locals to the fact that they are about to be forcibly relocated; something that incurs the wrath of Capt. Picard.This episode was a little disappointing; Wesley Crusher was always a bit too perfect and here we learn that he is in fact some sort of super-being with powers to control time! Wil Wheaton's performance is solid enough but can't save the character when we get such a revelation. We also get the revelation that one of Picard's ancestors was part of a Spanish force that massacred members of Pueblo Indians several centuries ago and those on the planet think this is an ancient wrong that needs righting it seemed surprising that this would be known so long after the event. The ultimate solution to the problem of the colonists seemed a little obvious; it is amazing that nobody suggested it sooner; they are just one small village on an entire planet; hardly the obstacle they were portrayed as. Overall a rather weak episode.,6

For fans of the ""Badlands"" Trek novels, Gul Evek's crossover from ""Next Gen"" to ""Voy"" (and later demise) is explained from this episode. Also the DS9 novels tie in these events to the ones in Season 7's ""Pre-emptive Strike""; where Ro meets Chakotay before his Maquis crew encounters the Caretaker.

This is a simplistic story of a group of Indian colonists who are about to be removed from their planet after treaty in the Federation. Wow, what a coincidence. This is not to diminish the plight of Native Americans; it's just the ridiculous contrivances of this. These people are resisting the treaty and are about to be put out on some remote planet (perhaps the planet of northern Oklahoma) without their permission. They are willing to take the chance of sitting in the middle of the Kardassian empire, but Picard has been given the job (against his wishes) of resettling. All that is enough to make this a weak episode, but for some reason, the recalcitrant version of Wesley Crusher, beset with ennui, has been chosen as their spiritual leader.

Several generations ago an American Indian tribe moved to a planet to preserve their culture and identity. But that planet became part of the Cardassian-Federation dispute and war.

I dislike the fact that Wesley had so much potential, his genius and the great encounters with the Traveler should have been explored, that's the way a storyline should have been taken.
Instead they cook up this plot line with a group of American Indians. (And why this need to portray American Indians on a planet thousands of light years away? The pulled that kind of trick in the original Star Trek. It didn't work that well either.) And really, would a pale face be looked upon as some sort of messiah?
This is another example of the way that TNG was veered off into societal topics, becoming too preachy and full of thinly veiled PC topics. When Roddenberry passed away, the ones who went forward with the writing really butchered what had made seasons 3, 4, and 5 such a hit. Considering all the flops that season 7 had, the series should ended with season 6.",4

This is one of the episodes where his side story ruins the otherwise excellent base premise. Apart from his annoying baby face stupid smile that's part of his ""acting"" in TNG every 2 minutes or so, there is absolutely no way any group of American Indians would have considered Wesley some sort of Messiah or treat him as one of their own, for a couple of simple reasons: he's too young, he's disobedient, he has no spiritual depth whatsoever and ... he disrespects elders, especially after joining the Academy. All these Wesley traits make him totally incompatible with a culture like the American Indian one, period.Other than that, the premise of this episode could have produced an effect relatively close to that of 'Inner Light', if exploited properly (maybe some tragic outcome of the main plot) - it certainly suited the culture's history. It wasn't to be however, and the Indians' and Wesley's stories were blended in a very unrealistic fashion. Picard or even Worf could have been much more suited for Wesley's act, while Wesley's subplot could have been merged into another, more suitable episode. In the end, it all looks forced and not that believable (to say the least), pretty much like trying to eat soup and cake together.",7

I thought it was a very good episode that brought Worf and his son closer together and showed what kind of future it might hold for both of them.When Alexander is hesitant about becoming a warrior, his father takes him to see a Klingon festival, so as to convince him that his culture is rich. They end up being attacked, and a stranger saves them. He is from the same house as Worf and tries to explain to young Alex that he needs to be able to fight to protect himself and those he cares about.I felt that the entire episode showed how Klingons can be rough and be a warrior race, and yet manage to be kind and affectionate when appropriate. *spoiler*They thing that seems to be off-putting for the reviewers is the fact that the stranger that appeared in this episode is Alex from the future. The reason is because Alex decides to grow up not being a warrior, but wanting peace between the households. As a result, Worf dies in his arms in roughly 30 years from now. He wants to force himself to be less foolish and to become a warrior so that his father doesn't die. Worf ends up saying that he is proud of Alex, saying that peace is a worthwhile goal and that now he has come to the future who knows how Worf will die.The reason for Alex going to the future is a bit, well, not existent. Just that he met a man in some sector that could help. Worf did believe him a little quick, but it wasn't completely unreasonable, I've heard worse excuses from ST:TNG.PS: I also enjoyed someone *else* time traveling and *we* have to take their acts on faith; too many times has someone gone to the future/past and had to explain themselves to the poor people of that episode, it was fun to see the exact opposite happening.*end spoiler*While the execution and development of certain aspects of the episode were somewhat poor, the story was entertaining and something I was very glad to see, especially in the last (and perhaps poorest) season of the show.",9
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Firstborn (TV Episode 1994)",One of the weaker Worf episodes.,"I was not thrilled by this episode--and this might be because I am a huge fan of Worf and so I tend to expect more from these shows. I almost always love episodes that focus on him (after all, what other member of the crew murdered someone in revenge and got away with it?!) but this one has a few problems--most likely the crazy twist at the end.The show begins with Worf at wits end because Alexander is not a demented maniacal warrior like a good Klingon should be. When Picard hears about it, he recommends that Worf take his son to a nearby planet for a Klingon holiday celebration. Once there, Worf is nearly killed and he is saved by a family friend (sort of like Robert Duvall's relationship to the Corleone family). This guy sees Worf is upset about Alexander and tries to help the boy rise above common sense and cling to his berserker-like Klingon roots.This isn't a bad episode...just the ending. See it...see what this dopey twist is and how quickly Worf just accepts this!",5
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Firstborn (TV Episode 1994)",Sort of Interesting Klingon Stuff,"Worf seems to never have made a commitment to his role as security officer. He has exhibited great distress over his connection to his son, who looks totally Klington but is pretty much basking in his white genes. He is a resistant little guy and Worf has designs for him to be a warrior. As the episode moves along, Alexander begins to become enthralled with Klingon stuff, but when push comes to shove, he moves back to his less aggressive self. This whole warrior thing and dying with honor seems sort of archaic, almost mythological in scope. A stranger enters the lives of the two and begins to bang the drum for Alexander to embrace his Klingon being, even suggesting that he go to a Klingon prep school (I wonder if they wear blazers). There is much more to this, however, and it ends on an interesting note. We also get to see the tussle between Worf's warrior side and the tender side of his role as father.",7
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Firstborn (TV Episode 1994)",Worf's son does not want to become a warrior,"Worf is concerned when his son Alexander tells him he does not wish to take part in the Klingon Rite of Ascension; something that must be done before he is thirteen if he is to become a Klingon warrior; as the Enterprise isn't doing anything urgent Capt. Picard suggests going to a nearby Klingon outpost where a festival is taking place. While there Worf is attacked by a group of Klingons but another warrior comes to his aid. This warrior is K'Mtar; a distant cousin, who offers to help guide Alexander. A weapon dropped by one of the attackers links them to the Duras family; the hunt to find them will require a chat to Deep Space Nine's Quark and a clever ploy against a group of ore smugglers. Once the Duras Sisters are finally found the protest their innocence and suspicion falls closer to home.Worf is a fine character but episodes that concentrate on the relationship between him and his son tend to be disappointing; and this one is no exception. It isn't that there is anything wrong with the acting; Alexander is just a bit of a tedious character and I just couldn't bring myself to care whether he becomes a warrior or not. On the plus side K'Mtar was a decent character and there was quite a twist regarding his identity at the end. It was also nice to have a cameo from Armin Shimerman as Quark and the Duras Sisters are always entertaining. Overall a comparatively weak episode with no real sense of excitement.",6

Douras sisters who played for power and lost earlier in the series.Seems pretty straightforward enough, But I assure you there's a lot more to
the story than that.Nice performance by Sloyan who is carrying a big secret and is one truly

DaiMon Bok (from the 1st season episode ""The Battle"", this time played by Lee Arenberg instead of Frank Corsentino), seeks to avenge his son because he thinks Picard killed him while he was captain of the Stargazer. In ""The Battle"", he gave Picard the Stargazer back as a ""gift"" but at the same time used a mind probe to make him relive the incident and ruin his life. With that plan averted, DaiMon Bok lost his rank.Now, he's back and a DaiMon again - to avenge his son, he will now kill Picard's son (which comes as a surprise to Picard since he never knew he had a son!) - his name is Jason Vigo. Picard feels he has a responsibility to protect him against Bok and goes to his rescue on Camor IV before it's too late.But, is Jason really Picard's son?",

He has sworn revenge and tells Picard that he has a son, unknown to him, and the D'Aimon is going to execute him. Picard finds the ""son"" and brings him aboard the Enterprise to protect him. Apparently, the Captain had had some dalliance in the past and this young rebellious guy was the result. Unfortunately, the Ferengi leader seems to have access to the ship and is set upon making PIcard pay. The episode involves Picard getting to know this young man and do what is right.

Well, the fun-loving DaiMon Bok is back--and this time he pledges to kill Picard's son...though as far as Picard knows he doesn't have one! So, the Captain thinks back and realizes that one woman might have given him a son many, many years ago. What follows is a strange little episode, as Picard tries to make up for lost time with a rather irresponsible and strange young man. And, of course, he tries to stop Bok before he can do very bad things.All in all, this is a decent but forgettable episode. It's mildly interesting to see the Captain think about what his life could have been like and the ending didn't seem all that surprising. Worth seeing but nothing more.",7

It's a Ferengi Daemon played by Larry Arenberg who says he's going to kill a son that Picard never knew he had. That's in revenge for Picard killing a son of his in battle years ago.Said son turns out to be Ken Olandt, son of a woman that Picard had been involved with in his younger days. Olandt is 24 now and a bit of a scapegrace. Nevertheless he's happy that he has a father now as is Patrick Stewart.However there's still the vengeful Ferengi to be dealt with and he's developed some kind of long range transportation system that has bedeviled the Enterprise crew. In the end all the truths are revealed about Picard, about Arenberg, and about Olandt. Dr. Crusher has a big part in finding those truths.Ken Olandt is engaging and likable in this story, the kind of son you would Jean-Luc Picard would have.

After some research Picard learns that a woman he had a brief relationship with over twenty years ago had a child not too long after he last saw her. The Enterprise manages to find the boy, who is now twenty three, and a DNA analysis quickly establishes that he is indeed Picard's son. The boy, Jason Vigo, doesn't seem interested in getting to know his father but the captain tries to get closer to him, even after learning of Jason's criminal past. Even though Jason is on the Enterprise Bok manages to kidnap him; if Picard is to save him he will have to teleport to Bok's ship alone.This is a decent enough episode, certainly better than the previous couple of episodes. The opening immediately grabs the viewers' attention as there had been no previous mention of Picard's son not surprising given that he was unaware of him. Bok is a decent antagonist although the idea that he could beam on and off the Enterprise seems a bit unlikely; one would think the Enterprise would have better security. Ken Olandt does a decent enough job as Jason and Lee Arenberg is fun as Bok but it is Patrick Stewart who impresses the most as Picard comes to terms with the news that he has a son and that he is about to be killed. The twist in the ending was reasonable but not really necessary. Overall not a bad episode but ultimately fairly forgettable.",7

This leads to a hodgepodge of stuff going on on the holodeck. There are a group of characters that seem to be part of a dream the ship is having. Whatever is going on appears to be a metaphor for correcting the problem. The ship isn't a true adversary; it is trying to find its way. Data and the gang must figure out what is going on. There is a kind of display that keeps repeating itself all around the ship that may be the clue to its intentions. As is often the case, things make sense to everyone but the audience.

How this ever got from paper to screen is beyond me. Such a shame to see Ronald D. Moore's hallowed name in there too! The script has no real redeeming qualities either.

It seems that something in the computer system is showing signs of sentience and it's centered on one of the holodecks. When the crew enters to see what's happening, they see various disparate characters from various programs on a train. Using metaphors as a guide, the crew decide to help the conductor get the train to where it's going--as otherwise the ship will continue behaving very unpredictably.It's a holo episode.

It turns out the train was from another 'Orient Express' program. It is initially assumed that it is just a fault on the holodeck but it becomes obvious that something else is wrong when the Enterprise suddenly goes into warp. Nobody gave the order but the action saved the ship. Investigations lead to the discovery of an emergent intelligence in the ship's computer. The holodeck appears to be the centre of this occurrence so much of the investigation takes place there. The program running combines elements of several other programs with various characters aboard a train representing ships functions. With many systems, including life support, offline the crew will have to help get the train to its destination if they are to save the ship and its crew.Holodeck episodes are usually weaker than average and this one was no exception in fact it was weak even when compared to other holodeck episodes. Having various parts of the holodeck program representing parts of the ship's emerging intelligence wasn't too subtle so the characters came across as walking clichés the story would probably have been more interesting we didn't have the metaphorical mumbo-jumbo on the holodeck and instead just had the crew on the Enterprise, outside the holodecks, working to find a solution.

8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Emergence (TV Episode 1994)",An interesting way to retell a rehashed plot,As we approach the final episodes of season seven it is obvious that the writers are having a difficult time bring new plots into the scripts.

But the writers reach deep down on this story and the new life form is the Enterprise itself.It all begins on the holodeck when a program malfunctions and begins running more than one program. Then the Enterprise begins operating on its on accord as if the ship is thinking for itself. And as with all these types of programs it will be up to the crew to help with a possible emerging life form.This was a rehashed story that has been used many times in the series. But what saved this show from becoming another repeat plot was the way the episode used the holodeck program characters to tie the story together with the main plot. It was a new way to bring an old story-line to life. As we approach the end of the series this episode proved that you can do new things with old plots.

It begins as Ro Laren (Michelle Forbes) returns to the cast after graduating from Starfleet and returning to the Enterprise crew. She was able to return to Starfleet thanks to Captain Picard's recommendation and she wants to repay the Captain for the kindness shown. But the task that she will be assigned with prove difficult for her.Due to problems with a group of rebels called the Maquis that are attacking Cardassain's ships, the peace treaty between the Cardassains and Starfleet could be in jeopardy. Ro will be assigned to infiltrate the rebel group and report where and when the Maquis plan to attack so that the Enterprise can put an end to this rebel group. However, Ro begins to have feeling for the rebel group and those feeling could risk her position with Starfleet and her loyalty and gratitude toward Captain Picard.This is an entertaining story that returned the series to the roots of personal conflict within the plot. This season has been sugary stories that tend to rely more on writing so that each main character gets face time rather than developing a good story. This episode went back to getting an interesting plot and develop the situation around the story. A nice show indeed!",9
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Preemptive Strike (TV Episode 1994)",All the wrong notes,"""Preemptive Strike"" is a rushed episode which features the return, and departure, of Ensign Ro Laren. Ro returns to the Enterprise after a lengthy absence while she received special training. She is greeted warmly by Picard, who then immediately assigns here to an undercover assignment to infiltrate the Maquis. The Maquis are engaged with a gorilla war against the Cardassians. The members of the Maquis who she meets provoke ambivalent emotions in Ro, which ultimately leads her to betray Picard and defect to the Maquis.While the acting, dialogue and production values are good to great, the episode feels like a misstep. Picard's genuine feelings of affection for Ro are overridden by his desire for her to complete the covert operation. The operation itself is questionable. I would expect Picard to raise many more questions than he does; in fact, he seems quite eager to be a 24th century CIA operative. He makes Ro into a tool to be used. If that was the goal, then the producers succeeded. The exception to the episode's failure is Ro's relationship to the elder Maquis leader, who symbolically takes Picard's place in Ro's life before his death. Again, if that was the goal, then it could be called a success. I call it a sellout, forcing Picard to behave in a manner totally inconsistent with what we know about him. Not recommended.",4

3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Preemptive Strike (TV Episode 1994)",Ro Laren's story arc concludes.,"ST:TNG:176 - ""Preemptive Strike"" (Stardate: 47941.7) - this is the 24th episode of the 7th and last season of Star Trek: The Next Generation.The newly promoted Lt. Ro Laren (Michelle Forbes in her first appearance since the 5th season) returns to the Enterprise and immediately embarks on an undercover mission to infiltrate the Maquis - a group living in the Demilitarized Zone who is against the Cardassians since the peace treaty since they are now on part of Cardassian territory instead of Federation (they will become a formidable foe in DS9 and VOY).Ro only takes this mission out of loyalty to Picard, being uneasy helping the Cardassians since she is Bajoran. After learning more about the Maquis, she grows more sympathetic with their cause. And due to this conflict of loyalties, Ro Laren is torn . . . but must soon make a choice.Trivia note: Deep Space Nine is mentioned here.",
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Preemptive Strike (TV Episode 1994)",She is who she is.,"There are so many remarkable things about this episode. The plot, the writing, the politics, the performances, especially that of the beautiful Ms. Michelle Forbes. Can we really call Lieutenant Ro a traitor? The reason this episode is so great is because we become just as torn as Lt. Ro? While ultimately our allegiances may lie with Starfleet, in the end we understand why she did what she did. I love the radical character that is Lt. Ro. She is committed to justice for her people ""by any means necessary"" (in the words of the great El-hajj Malik Shabazz). At the end of the episode we see Captain Picard, perplexed in the extreme, nearly in a state of shock. I can only imagine he is hurt, furious, disappointed. Perhaps some part of him feels like a fool. But what he will wrestle with the most is the part of himself that understands why she did what she did, the part of himself that recognizes that she is who she is, maybe even some part of himself that knew that this was a possible outcome.",10
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Preemptive Strike (TV Episode 1994)",Ro goes undercover with the Maquis,This episode sees the return of recently promoted Lt Ro Laren after time away on the Advanced Tactical Training course; she doesn't get time to settle back into life on the Enterprise though as she is soon sent on a dangerous undercover mission. After the peace between the Federation and the Cardassians some of those who have found their home worlds are now in Cardassian territory are fighting against what they see as their new oppressors. These are the Maquis and it is Lt Ro's job to infiltrate the group and lure them into an ambush so they can be captured by the Federation. They are initially suspicious of Ro but when she helps them steal a large quantity of medical supplies from the Enterprise they grow to trust her. As she gets to know them she starts to symaphise with their cause; she tries to get Capt Picard to call off the mission but he refuses and tells her that if she fails to continue with the mission as planned she will be in serious trouble for disobeying orders; ultimately Ro must decide whether to follow orders or do what she believes is right.There have been rather too many poorer than average episodes this season but this isn't one of them. When Ro Laren was introduced she quickly became one of my favourite characters so I was rather disappointed that she quickly disappeared from the show with now real explanation this tells us why she was away and gives her one of her best stories; she is definitely the main character and the excellent Michelle Forbes has no difficulty carrying the episode. Too often in Star Trek the issues are very black and white and the Federation are always the good guys but here things are less certain; the peace with the Cardassians is clearly a good thing overall but those now on the wrong side of the border find themselves bullied by an oppressive regime so it is understandable that they will fight back. This provides a real dilemma for Ro and for once one can see Picard might be on the wrong side of the argument. As the episode progresses it is far from obvious how the story will end but as Ro gets closer to the Maquis the possibility that she won't help the Federation capture them rises distinctly. Overall a really good episode with some moral ambiguity and some decent action.,9

Hearts may be with the Maquis, but the Federation has a treaty with the Cardassians.Patrick Stewart sends Michelle Forbes on a mission to seek out a Maquis cell and find out what they're up to. But what happens is that she starts a realization of her Bajoran roots when she meets up with the Maquis cell. Most especially with the head of said cell John Franklyn- Robbins with whom she develops an almost father/daughter relationship.Captain Picard has considered Ro his own protégé and Michelle Forbes's scenes with Picard as well as Macias the Maquis leader have a lot of poignancy.In the end, in her last appearance on TNG as Ro Laren Michelle Forbes gave a real good performance. I do regret that she was not able to be worked into a Deep Space Nine episode or two.",8

At the time, it appeared as if she was going to become a regular on the show but after only a few appearances she disappeared until this penultimate episode. It begins with the Maquis suddenly gaining an advantage over the Cardassians in their guerilla war. Since the members of this rogue organization are mostly made up of people living within the Federation, it's up to the Enterprise to try to bring their terrorist ways under control and bring these rebels to justice. To do so, Picard asks Ro to go undercover--a thoroughly stupid idea, as she obviously is very much in sympathy with these folks. Can she serve the Federation or will her natural inclination to hate Cardassians and kick butt propel her towards becoming a traitor to Starfleet?This is a decent enough episode and it's well done. My only complaint and reason I give this one a 7 is because the character was pretty much abandoned by the writers and suddenly makes an appearance in the second to last episode...which feels kind of weird and contrived.",7
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Preemptive Strike (TV Episode 1994)",limited success..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 07The seventh act of the series seemed like an overstretched material where the writers were clearly running out of ideas, although to balance it properly, there are few brilliant concepts that defines the ingenious of Star Trek.Preemptive StrikeIt builds up a character to be indestructible and then he breaks in by putting it in an ethical dilemma that makes her think twice, a good comeback by the series although some might complain that we would like to see more of the familiar faces.",
0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" All Good Things... (TV Episode 1994)",One of the best final episodes for a TV series,"Your reading this for one of possibly two reasons:A) You want to know how others feel about this final episode that you've also seen or,..B) You have no idea about Star TrekGiven the popularity of this series, I'll assume ""A"" is your reason. However, if your the rare ""B"" person, then I recommend avoiding this episode until you've watched at least a few episodes of The Next Generation.This wonderful 2-hour finale utilizes the history of these characters and plots beautifully and with reverence. The lead character of the series, Jean Luc Picard, finds that he is inexplicably shifting between 3 time periods within his own liftime (past, present and future). Once he finds the reason for this, things become more complex and intriguing. His eyes are opened to an even greater threat than what he had perceived to be his own. As wonderful a premise that is, the subplots greatly enhance the characters and draw you into the story.For example, Tasha Yar, a well regarded character in the series was killed early in the shows run. In his shift into the past, Picard once again sees her alive, accompanying him to the Enterprise for the first time (again, ironically). Once he returns to the present, he laments over having seen her again. A beautifully played little scene.The main story combined with these subplots makes for one of the best written series endings ever in TV history.Let's hope that future TV series (not necessarily Trek, of course) have the opportunity to do the same.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" All Good Things... (TV Episode 1994)",Thank you Captain Jean-Luc Picard,"Ten years ago (i was 21 years old), studying an university exam (Diritto Pubblico), i started to watch Star Trek The Next Generation. It was a great daily meeting for me and my school-mate Loris and i still remember my delusion when we missed the second part of the ""attack of Borg"" cause the local Italian television transmitted it on Saturday. After 10 years i have just finished the vision of ""All Good Things"" and i must say i am tearing for commotion. I bought the 7 DVD-series of STTNG (i received some of them as a present too) last year and now, after one year, i saw all the movies. I have no words: WONDERFUL. I have the first three DVD series of Deep Space Nine ready, but i am certain that in the present, in the past and in the future, my only captain will be Jean-Luc Picard. (sorry for my English)",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" All Good Things... (TV Episode 1994)",Going out with a bang,"Caution: Spoilers Ahead!!!Like most fans of TNG I am sad to view the final episode, but happy to see that it is one of the strongest.  It is right along with ""the best of both worlds"" and ""cause and effect"" as the three best TNG episodes and I consider this the pinnacle of the series.  To be honest, it viewed more like a movie than a TV show and I love how they made it double length without splitting it over two different episodes.This final chapter was superbly written, directed, and acted.  I thought the love interest with Worf and Troy, although surprising, did not seem too forced and Riker's handling of it was exactly in character.  It was also great for the show to remain consistent whenever it deals with the past, sporting the old uniforms and bringing back some old faces.  In my personal opinion, this is one of the major strengths in the whole star trek series: the progression of uniforms, ship styles and everything is continually linked to a time period and is accurately referenced whenever an episode needs to deal with the past.  I also really enjoyed the ending, with Picard finally sitting down for a poker game with the rest of the crew; his concluding line ""I should have done this earlier"" is a perfect last-line for the series.Lastly, like all Star Trek episodes when they are at their best, this show made me think.  The paradoxial nature of time and time travel is really interesting to contemplate; it reminds us that any of our actions, not matter how insignificant, can have profound effects.  And I love how Q mentions that it is in the study of these paradoxes that science should continue, not in mapping star systems or other trivial things.
All in all this episode is a 10/10.  The added appeal of being able to see what all the crew could have looked like in 25 years was a great extra touch too.  A tremendous ending to a tremendous series, I am sad that TNG is over. But of course (I have to say it:) ""all good things must come to an end.""",10

I've been watching the DVD Year sets of TNG and its great to see the show again, without commercials! I remember when I watched this last episode. Seeing it again recently, I thought then and now that it was one show that could've gone on much longer. Except for some of the Enterprise episodes, Star Trek hasn't been as good since, and its really too bad that this crew will not likely make another movie after the underrated Nemesis.TNG had some really good performances, both by the regular cast and guests. Some actors worked for scale wages just to be a little part of the Star Trek experience. Although all of the cast were great, the standouts have to be Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner. It is amazing that neither one garnered awards or even nominations for their work on this show. Their acting elevated the some of the scripts to another level.True fans won't be able to resist having this show at their fingertips and this last show ""All Good Things..."" is reason enough to get Season 7.

I, for one, enjoyed seeing how the writers projected these characters beyond anything they had presented in any of the previous episodes.So, if you enjoy the series, and are looking for an all encapsulating episode that contains action, thought, character relationships and a little Trek history, this is definitely the episode for you.

""All Good Things"" will go down in the Star Trek and Sci-Fi grapevine as the most watched and defining show of its time. Kudos.",9
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" All Good Things... (TV Episode 1994)",The best example of Star Trek; better than all the movies.,"Rating: **** out of ****While the original crew had it better with the movies, The Next Generation was the only Star Trek TV series that I watched consistently. The show had a cast that at least equalled that of the original, boasted better production values, and plots that were intriguing and touched on varieties of concepts that Kirk, Spock, and Bones never got the chance to explore. Deep Space Nine was too mired into the whole ""war of the quadrants"" to explore any ideas with real satisfaction, and while Voyager had the best effects and the best premise, the cast was middling at best. Enterprise took a while to get going but had a superb third season and a solid fourth. All Good Things..., the swan song episode for TNG, is possibly the best of Star Trek, period, focusing on mind-boggling concepts while retaining the character development and human interest that made the show so appealing. It's the seventh year that the crew of the Starhip Enterprise have been together, but Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) is experiencing odd timeshifts. He's constantly switching between three different time periods; in the past, right before the Farpoint mission, in the present, and in the future, where the crew has long split up, Picard is retired and is diagnosed with a debilitating mental illness. Naturally, the rest of the crew is skeptical (be it in any time period), but when Picard discovers the true nature of his constant shifting, he realizes it is both the means and cause with which the existence of mankind could be erased.I hesitate to give too much away, though I doubt anyone with a passing interest in Star Trek hasn't already seen this episode. But it plays as an interesting comparison and contrast to the series' first episode, Encounter at Farpoint, which it directly ties in to with Picard's timeshifting to the past. There's been a notable improvement in the quality of the sets and the visual effects, and also the acting, the pacing, and the plot development.All Good Things... has all the solid acting one expects from the cast, and a human touch that was missing from the latest film, Nemesis. It's interesting to note that this episode (meaning the whole series, as well) ends with the door open for all sorts of possibilities; at this time, this clearly implied the much-hyped transition to the big screen.Unfortunately, some of the more open-ended questions this episode focused on were never even touched on. Sure, the Worf/Troi/Riker triangle was resolved, but one of my favorite ongoing side stories, the burgeoning romance between Picard and Dr. Crusher, was completely ignored in the movies. And the final scenes lead one to believe that the movies would take us to ""places"" never explored, even though the most recent film was merely a plot less action movie that didn't even have enough action to warrant the movie's existence.Stewart is the true highlight of this episode, displaying the great acting chops he's been known for. The fact that we care for him and the rest of the crew as well, adds a sense of urgency and involvement in the proceedings that the otherwise quite frantic pace alone might not have been able to develop. The plot twists are pure Trek, each mysterious element giving away to some big revelation that only leads to more questions. The story is engrossing, the dialogue is strong, and the performances and characterizations are spot-on.There are a few problems with All Good Things. The timeshifting obviously means we're going to see past and future versions of the cast, but everyone's aged to a certain extent where they can't quite pass for their more youthful selves and the old-age makeup is never entirely convincing (Old Riker's first appearance gave me a good laugh). That said, I would like to make mention of what full-blown hotties Marina Sirtis and especially Gates McFadden became (McFadden is easily the most attractive post 50-year old actress I've ever seen).The continuing movie series actually began quite well; Generations and First Contact were enjoyable adventures, but everything seemed to fall apart with Insurrection. Funny, All Good Things... is a title that turned out more self-prophetic than anyone would have guessed.",

Great makeup for every one, especially Doctor Crusher and Whorf as they age!Second, it not only shows in detail what happened to them 25 years after the series ends, this episode also integrates that future into the story! Not only that, as we find out, it's a vital key in the puzzle of the entire episode! Kudos to the genius plotters and writers of it! It's a fanatic fan's dream come true! Third, the pacing, editing and development are so well done -- the pace gradually increases over the two hour length until the final denouement. The whole mystery shifting between three time periods.

The danger in all three time periods was a good story and a brilliant riddle for Picard, who the story is really about, to figure out.

Of course I thought this was nuts and thought there was no way it was going to be better than TOS.I came back to the US during the 3rd year of the show.

However this time it is Picard himself who has caused the destruction and unravelling of the universe itself, although he has no idea how? When I first saw this double episode adventure I was a major fan of the series and having been largely disappointed with series 7 was hoping I would get a big finish to the series and I was not disappointed. The story is great and continues very much in the vain of the last Q episode ""Tapestry"" arguably up there as one of the best Q episodes ever. The performances by the cast are verging on perfect as they have got to the point where the characters are like a favourite suit that you were with pride and panache, because you know that whatever happens, you're gonna look great in it. The effects are great and there are some truly fantastic images and moments that are so well written that it brings home everything that we love about trek. The direction is flawless and the ending is so amazing that it almost makes me cry.Better than all the next gen films out together and so sad that they couldn't do it on the big screen.

23,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" All Good Things... (TV Episode 1994)",One of the best series endings of all time!,I recently watched the whole series from start to finish and it brought back a lot of nostalgia.

24,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" All Good Things... (TV Episode 1994)",Finest TNG Episode Ever Filmed,"The finest TNG episode ever filmed.A time travel story in the hands of lesser writers can be a hackneyed plot device to cover up weaknesses with a bad script or weak acting.Not here. The story expands character development and is a sustained study on how we deal with life choices, what we learn from them and how we grow as persons.This is a far more important message than the anomaly, Q's power or everything else going on that Captain Picard doesn't understand happening around him. This is NOT a spoiler - people can read other reviews for that. My intention is to draw out certain lessons we can discover in this episode and people can surely find others for themselves as well.We are made to care because he and people he is close to don't always appreciate why he does what he does and there is a certain truth to the old adage that with age comes wisdom and youth is wasted on the young.We all look back on our lives and wonder if we lived as well as we could have and if we could really change who we are, we would be happier. I keep thinking of the famous scene in Proust that every one remembers by heart - where a little lump of sugar dissolved in a cup of tea compel the narrator to recall his life and an incident Picard initially gives no real thought to suddenly has profound meaning for his entire life.The episode forces us to think big and it also in a poignant way affirms for us the importance of family and friends and in the closing scene, Captain Picard resolves never again to take for granted the Enterprise family when he joins them for the first time in their card game on board the ship.In a word, the acting, storyline and feel here is top notch and is what fans expect of the Star Trek canon and it also serves as a bookend as it were, to the opening episode, ""Encounter At Farpoint"" - that launched TNG (though people who have never watched the show don't have to watch everything else that went on before to enjoy a piece of great story-telling) and returns the show as it were back to its roots - showing that it remembers and honors them.

Picard and crew, with the help of 1890s Guinan and Mark Twain, learn to figure out what's happening - and what they find out surprises us all.Trivia note: Jack London (a pioneer in new world of commercial magazine fiction, he was one of the first Americans to make a huge financial success from writing) is the bellboy of a hotel Data is staying at (and under the suggestion of Mark Twain, he should go into writing himself).Also, a mention is made to the not-yet-happened 1906 earthquake, with one guy scoffing that there hasn't been an earthquake for 30 years, not believing one is possible in the near future.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Time's Arrow: Part II (TV Episode 1992)",How I Hate This Character,"This great episode was completely spoiled for me by this obnoxious character portrayal of Mark Twain or Samuel Clemens. Why on earth make him such a silly squeaky voiced obnoxious character. Such a great story - ruined by this actor.Maybe Jerry Hardin - the actor who played the character - is famous in his own field, but in this episode he was an unwanted, over-played, irritating presence. He took over most of the scenes he was in, but not in a way that endeared you to him. He was a complete distraction to the plot with his silly squeaky voice.I hope I never see him again.",5
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Time's Arrow: Part II (TV Episode 1992)","""A WereWolf!""","This second part was written by Jeri, who captured the essence of the first part. Of course, she had to wrangle a part for her son (Who would later become Vorick in Voyager) as the young reporter Twain is talking to in the teaser.In fact, this teaser threw me for a loop, I had been expecting Twain to react differently. I had thought he was more of a progressive gent, but then again, he was acting on a perceived threat. And that is what made the characterization great.Of course, Picard's away team is also acting on the same perceived threat, but with Landladies and crooked policemen (Played by William Boyett of ""The Big Goodbye"") interfering, it was harder for their little Shakespearean Acting Troop. But the meat of this story is all laid out here, where Data's history coincides with the Away Team's history, and both coincide to 1893's ""Cholera Epidemic"". This part of the story moves a lot more rapidly, as it is less Discovery and more Solution. And of course, includes Picard's very first meeting with Guinan.Meanwhile, Twain is investigating Data, so eventually all blazes get let loose when all parties involved including the Dividia-II aliens meet up in the Mining Shaft. It's kind of an Er, ""Explosive"" situation. Which gives Twain a unique opportunity to meet a ""were-Worf"" I think such ""time shifts"" would drive normal people mad.But the idea was to solve this conundrum and have fun at the same time, and it was a success in that respect. As a Fan of both Twain and Trek I was tickled. These two episodes speak for themselves, this is again the Heart of Trek- Prevent Alien Incursions, and Have Fun with Historical Figures.",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Time's Arrow: Part II (TV Episode 1992)",Mark Twain's accent is insane and distracting,He was from the South. Why is he talking like cartoon coal miner?,
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Time's Arrow: Part II (TV Episode 1992)",Flawed: too many things make no sense,"I always find this the weakest of the two-part episodes. It is a pretty good story, marred by some flaws of logic. I shall simply list some of them:o It was previously established that *only* Data's doohickey could provide the needed sensitivity to allow for the phase change. That was a crucial point, because it was the *only* reason that Picard allowed Data to go on the mission at all. Now, all of a sudden, Geordi can build another one, no problem. If Geordi was able to build one, why didn't they try that *the first time*, instead of risking Data?o When the landing party is assembled to go after Data, its makeup makes no sense. The initial party is supposed to be Riker, Geordi, Worf, Crusher, and Troy. OK, Riker to lead the mission, makes sense. Geordi to run the technical gadgetry, OK. Worf because who knows what dangers they'll encounter, makes sense. But Troy and Crusher? Seriously? Troy and Crusher? Because Data's going to need a doctor? Or a *counselor*??? Wouldn't a couple of security guys make more sense?o But it gets worse. Then Picard decides to insert himself into the mission. So who does he send back to the ship? The useless Troy or Crusher? No. The now useless Riker-- (Picard himself will now obviously lead the mission)? No. Worf. The one guy it would make sense to bring when you're going up against some unknown, unseen aliens. But this is beyond just a bad assessment of the away team. Consider *the ship*. If Picard goes on the mission, *and* Riker, *and* Geordi-- and Data's already missing-- you now have *every* top officer missing from the Enterprise. When Worf is sent back to the ship-- he's actually *in command*! He's the ranking officer! You're up against mysterious aliens of unknown and apparently hostile intent, and you're going to leave the flagship of the Federation under the command of a mere Lieutenant? In the whole rest of the series we never see Worf in sole command of the ship (yeah, once he sat in the chair while Picard was waiting in the next room). *** Wouldn't it have made VASTLY more sense to send Riker back instead of Worf ***?(Of course, these flaws stem from lazy writing. The writer, already knowing what they were going to encounter in San Francisco, had hand-picked the landing party in a way that Picard could not. For instance, they needed Crusher to discover the truth about the plague, and they needed to *not* have Worf, so as not to need to explain his Klingon appearance to the 19 century folk)o The entire, problematic appearance of the landing party in 19th century San Francisco is completely skipped over. How did *all five* of them suddenly appear there, in Federation uniform, without causing anyone to notice or be concerned? Where did they get their 19th century clothes from? And if they were able to get clothes, why weren't they able to get rent money? Crusher was working as a nurse, that should have provided enough income to afford their one room.o Riker asserts that if you were a time-traveling species that wanted to kill humans without attracting notice, that you'd go to some plague-ridden time. Which makes sense. So wouldn't 12th century Europe-- at the time of the actual Black Plague-- make much more sense than 19th century San Francisco? I think history provides *tons* of better choices than 19th century San Francisco. How about the Irish potato famine? World War II Stalingrad?o Why on earth didn't Data and Guinan take Twain into their confidence? Guinan knew Twain, knew him to be an intelligent and sensible man, why wouldn't they trust him with the truth? Telling him lies and stories was obviously only making him more suspicious and paranoid.o Um, why is Twain portrayed as such a frothing Luddite? I can find no evidence that the real Mark Twain was one. In fact, he was an early adopter (for a while, at least) of that new-fangled invention of the era, the typewriter.OK, so far these are all somewhat minor. But this is the big one:o Explain to me how it makes any sense at all that the *only* food these aliens can eat is human neuro-chemical energy. *Human*. Vulcan or Klingon won't do. Has to be human. The humans have never even *heard* of these people, how do the aliens even *know* about humans? How does a race on one planet evolve such that its only source of food comes from beings on a planet a zillion light years away? And all this, to get what? ""electrochemical energy""? What's so unique about our electrochemical energy? It's really just chemical energy. And not even that much of it, how much voltage is there in the human nervous system? How is this not something they could create artificially? Or for that matter, why not just use animals? Humans differ from animals in the complexity of their brain structure, not in the fundamentals of neurochemistry. There's no good reason why the aliens couldn't eat cow energy. This whole we-must-eat-human-energy thing ***makes no sense***.",6
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Time's Arrow: Part II (TV Episode 1992)",Fun but flawed,"Apart from the poor sit-com with the landlady, this was good, if contrived, fun. Those who complained about Samuel Clemens voice/accent have clearly not done their homework. He did make audio recordings (on wax cylinders) but none are known to have survived.) However, the actor William Gillette (best know as the first to play Sherlock Holmes) knew Clemens and used to impersonations of him on stage. He recorded at least one and it sounds like what we hear here.",8
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Time's Arrow: Part II (TV Episode 1992)","Well written and contrary to what others said, having very few plot holes","This was an excellent time related episode, and a decent continuation of part one from the previous season. While I found that flaws and plot holes are present in other ST TNG episodes (a valid reason to dislike those), I disagree with other reviewers here who claim this is one of them - in fact, I believe this is one of the episodes having the least amount of flaws and plot holes, and that is something to appreciate, especially for a time travel related episode. I'll try to explain these supposed flaws and plot holes mentioned mainly by wesleyprang's and Qanqor's reviews (warning: long post):""Guinan would want a job on the Enterprise, so Picard going on mission in order to meet Guinan is a flaw"" (wesleyprang). Guinan repeatedly emphasized that she values trust much more than being in a place where everybody else wants to be (i.e. Enterprise), and her trust in Picard was the sole reason why she chose to be a bartender on that ship. She wouldn't have been able to trust Picard if they hadn't met in the past, hence Picard had to go on the mission.""Data pays Jack London lots of money, but has no money to pay Picard's rent"" (wesleyprang). That is believable, since he had to buy a lot of other stuff for the device he was building, plus he had to buy the carriage he used to save the team from the police, so he may have ran out of money by the time he got to Picard's rented place. He was also probably searched by the police, so he had to stay low and avoid playing poker for money for a while.""The Devidians only prey on the sick and dying - people who are already in a hospital bed, so it's obvious that they take only what they need to survive; this makes them a threat to all Humanity - even though Humans are spread far and wide by the 24th Century"". While from a natural point of view it is acceptable to prey on the sick and dying, in human society a crime is still a crime, even if you murder a sick person. Who knows, that person might eventually recover, if he or she wasn't preyed on. Plus, it's understandable to have a bias on not killing humans, if you are human yourself. Humans are indeed spread far and wide by the 24th century, but this might be exactly because the Devidians were ultimately stopped from preying on humans by the Enterprise team in their 19th century mission from this episode.""Except that there were plenty of Earthquakes in San Fran - one happened just a few months previously"". We are not talking about now, but the time frame when the Enterprise team went on their mission, i.e. at the end of the 19th century. I don't know the specifics, but I believe that the writers were careful to be accurate in that regard for that specific time frame, considering they even had a line mentioning that there wasn't any major earthquake in S.F. for 30 years. That tells me they did research the issue a bit, so the line would make sense.""If Geordi was able to build a device having the needed sensitivity to allow for the phase change, why didn't they try that the first time, instead of risking Data?"" (Qanqor). First, it was urgent, in order to stop the aliens feeding on humans, and secondly: using the device built into Data was accessible immediately, compared to Geordi building his own; it was safer and certain to work compared to an experimental attempt by Geordi; they didn't had to risk any actual human team lives; it allowed a slightly delayed vocal communication with the other team members (not sure Geordi would have been able to incorporate that feature into his own device). Also, if you watch those moments carefully, Geordi didn't say that he couldn't build such a device, he merely said that they didn't have one on the ship at the moment (except for Data's one, that is) - it's easy to overlook the possibility of building such a device, you naturally first think whether you have one at hand or not.""When the team is assembled to go after Data, its makeup makes no sense, and it gets worse, when Picard sends Worf back to the ship"" (Qanqor). It does make sense. Crusher was useful to treat potential injuries to the affected humans, discover how the aliens drained them of energy, and maybe find a cure. Troi was useful in sensing pain from the humans the aliens preyed on, life or distress signs caused by a team member's potential capture in case they split the team to better find Data, and so on. Riker was useful too, since after Data and Worf, he's supposed to be the only male having the physical qualities to handle potential combat, and if the team split, he would command a team while Picard would command the other. If there was a slip up in assembling the original team for the mission, that had to be Worf, since his Klingon appearance would have caused huge problems in a 19th century Earth, but that is corrected when he's replaced by Picard. Worf is exactly the one that had to be absent from the team that investigated what the aliens were doing on the 19th century Earth and went after Data (his looks), and precisely the one that had to stay in command of the Enterprise near a hostile alien race planet (he's the security chief).""The entire, problematic appearance of the away team in 19th century San Francisco is completely skipped over."" (Qanqor) Skipped over, yes, but not flawed. Unlike Data, they probably materialized in the cave from Earth (since they followed the aliens when going there), so their appearance wouldn't have been an issue, since no human was present in the cave. Their clothes could be bought afterwards, using the same trick Data used when he wanted to play poker: sell their partially gold-made subspace transmitters, since they had no use for them in a 19th century Earth and they would have easily have others made for them when they returned to the Enterprise. They weren't able to get rent money because that would have been well beyond the cost of a trasmitter, and they wouldn't have been able to count on dr. Crusher's ""income"" as a nurse, since she was just pretending to be hired, she was not actually working there (pay attention to how she doesn't turn her face to the doctor when he speaks to her in the episode, in order to avoid letting him know that she's not one of the actual nurses).""So wouldn't 12th century Europe at the time of the Black Plague make much more sense as a timeframe for the alien time travel than 19th century San Francisco?"" (Qanqor) Definitely. However, it is never mentioned (and open to debate) whether this was the first time the aliens preyed on humans or not. Maybe they travelled to the 12th century Europe as well, and it just happened that their San Francisco time travel was the one where the Enterprise team could stop them, considering Data's head in that Earth cave, that triggered the mission. Not to mention that the tech of both the aliens and the Enterprise team would have been impossible to hide and tolerate in a 12th century Europe, where they would have been almost certainly accused of sorcery and executed.""Why on earth didn't Data and Guinan take Twain into their confidence?"" (Qanqor) Several reasons come to mind: the Prime Directive, avoiding altering the current timeline, the difficult task of convincing a man with such strong beliefs as Twain that they were not ""invaders"" (remember, he wasn't convinced until he saw the 24th century realities and Troi made a case for many of the humanity's shortcomings being corrected in the future they lived in), and ... well, he was a writer, so his primary reaction would have been to let his readers (and the reporters) know about the whole thing. It's like convincing a TV channel not to run their most shocking news story - not going to happen.""Why is Twain portrayed as such a frothing Luddite?"" (Qanqor) He is not portrayed as opposing new technology or ways of working - he's simply portrayed as someone who thinks that in this case, the technology is used to ""invade"" (or facilitate an invasion of) the Earth by some suspicious individuals. That is entirely logical and believable - after all, we have even today people that are very much adepts of new technologies, but who are worried or fear that too much of the new technology (or that technology falling into the wrong hands) would lead to bigger problems (artificial intelligence built into human-like robots or nuclear weapons are classic examples of this).""How it makes any sense at all that the only food these aliens can eat is human neuro-chemical energy."" (Qanqor) Easy: it's the same as any of us preferring to eat cooked food over raw food, or chicken over pork, or diet food over fat-rich food, and so on. Food is not just a matter of necessity, but also a matter of preference. From our perspective, the neuro-chemical energy of a human, Vulcan, Klingon or that of a cow might look the same, but for such a race it might be that the human one is more...""tasty"", maybe richer in their calories equivalent for this type of ""food"", or simply, more accessible than other types of neuro-chemical energy. Talking about accessibility, we know that the cave on Earth has a similar ideal configuration to amplify the phase shifting signals used to time travel as the cave on the Devidian planet, so they have a foothold on Earth. The phase change of 0.0040 used to time travel to 19th century Earth is very close to the 0.0047 change used to destroy the aliens, so it might be that the 19 century Earth was the closest food source for the aliens's time machine (after they probably exhausted the food available on their home planet).All in all, a well made episode. The only minor flaw I see is having Guinan as a black woman in the high society circles of a 19th century US, only a couple of years after the American Civil War - it just isn't realistic. But then, there were similar worse flaws in other movies, and diversity was always preferred to realism (suspension of disbelief?). At least here Guinan's character is crucial for the episode, and Whoopi plays her expertly.",9
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Time's Arrow: Part II (TV Episode 1992)",Mark Twain Keeps history's secrets,"The story that began with Jean-Luc Picard finding Data's detached head in a cavern near San Francisco reaches its conclusion in the concluding episode. Some aliens from the planet Davidia have been using earth as a feeding ground and the eating seems to be good around San Francisco bay.It's quite an adventure and part of the reason is that one of the most intellectually curious people in the history Samuel Langhorne Clemens or better known as Mark Twain overhears Data and Guinan conversing and knows this is important though he reaches the wrong conclusion.Of course the Enterprise crew defeats the aliens and time resumes its normal course. Jerry Hardin does a wonderful job as Mark Twain. You really think it is Twain.Sad to say though that most pessimistic of men never changed his attitude despite the glimpse into the distant future that he got in this episode. It was more than a glimpse, it was a grand tour courtesy of Counselor Troi.Still seeing Jerry Hardin as Twain makes this TNG story worth a watch.",6
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Time's Arrow: Part II (TV Episode 1992)",I enjoyed the Mark Twain twist,"**Spoiler Alert**I have to respectfully disagree with those bashing the Twain character. I loved him in this. The cigar, the hair, the period outfit and timepiece, his tireless pursuit of truth and knowledge mixed with great wit. Read up on the real man, and I think they did an excellent job. Did you know in real life Twain dabbled in mining in California? How does that not tie in nicely? If you needed a muck raker to stir the plot pot, he was a good choice.The only thing that I felt was questionable is the concept that a woman of color could, in the time period and location given, freely associate with whites as Guinean's character is shown doing. Revisionist history? perhaps. I don't know enough about California after the Gold rush to question it further.Overall, I loved all the performances, pacing, story development from I-II, and eventual outcome",
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Time's Arrow: Part II (TV Episode 1992)",It gets better,"The first half of 'Time's Arrow' offered up a rather mediocre cliffhanger, but 'Part II' livens things up with an entertaining conclusion. It takes a bit to really get going (still dealing with Data's hiding out in San Fransisco), but once the time portal opens back up, it pretty well balances the 19th and 24th centuries. Jerry Hardin's Samuel Clemens was a highlight, marveling at the Enterprise and offering comment on poverty and technology. Things really clicked for me here, and the problem of retrieving the captain from centuries earlier and reviving Data offered the episode some urgency.Turned into a decent payoff.7/10",7
10,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Time's Arrow: Part II (TV Episode 1992)",Returning to the 24th Century,"This, the first episode of season six, is the second of a two-part story and follows immediately from the events of the previous episode. Data in 19th Century San Francisco and the away team have just emerged from the temporal rift in an attempt to find him and thwart the activities of the shape shifting aliens. They discover the aliens are using a cholera epidemic as a cover for their harvesting of human neural energy that they feed on. After a run in with the local police they escape with Data and plan to return to the cavern where Data's head was found; there is a slight problem though; Samuel Clemens believes Data and the others are not just from the future but that they are intent on interfering with humanity in his time. Convinced that he must stop there interference he endangers the mission and ultimately ends up back on the Enterprise with the away team while Picard is left in the 19th Century.After a good introduction to the story I was a little disappointed with its conclusion; it wasn't bad, it just could have been better. Mark Twain's involvement was clearly meant to be rather amusing but was more irritating as was the away team's pretending to be a troupe of actors to avoid telling the owner of a boarding house that they couldn't pay her. On the plus side it was nice to see the first time Guinan met Picard and it was good to see Data's head reunited with his body after five hundred years apart; especially as it enabled Picard to send a vital message which was received just in time to avoid a major error. Overall this was a decent enough episode that could have been better if it had avoided shoehorning real characters into the story.",7

But the crew are able to come up with some confusing way to join Data and they learn about the weird creatures that have come to Earth's past to kill people and harvest the energy in the victims' brains and spinal columns. Naturally they have to stop this as well as all return to the present. There is a slight glitch, however, as Mark Twain (yes, THAT Mark Twain) learns about their plans and threatens the timeline because of this.I enjoyed part one more than part two simply because I didn't love the Mark Twain angle and I also thought the character was a bit too hammy. He wasn't terrible--I just didn't like this in the story. Worth seeing, however.",7

As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it.

Reginald 'Reg' Barclay III, this one deals with his fear of the transporter. At first he is reluctant to go on an Away Team mission, but when he transports, a mysterious creature appears in the matter stream and touches his arm. Then, back on the Enterprise, his arm starts to radiate with light where the creature touched him! What is causing this? Is Barclay going delusional? Find out in the first of many exciting 6th season episodes (this season in my opinion is second best only to the 3rd season).Trivia note: we finally get to see a person's POV as they are transported. Patti Yasutake makes another appearance as Nurse Alyssa Ogawa. We also hear O'Brien regale Barclay with his arachnophobia and how he overcame his fear of spiders - thus, introducing him to his pet tarantula!And, O'Brien mentions the ""Heisenberg Compensators"" used in the transporter, mentions there hasn't been a case of transporter psychosis in 50 years, and O'Brien has held the transporter chief position for 22 years).",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Realm of Fear (TV Episode 1992)",Realm of Fear,"The Enterprise is investigating the mystery behind the USS Yosemite's communication silence, a science vessel studying a remote ""Plasma Streamer"", having been pulled into the streamer after getting a bit too close. Most of the crew is missing from the ship except a badly burned engineer, with heavy damage to the transporter on the Yosemite. Neurotic Systems Engineer, Reginald Barclay (Dwight Schultz), is overwhelming afraid of transporters, and when Geordi wants him to accompany the away team to the Yosemite, he just can't bring himself to do it. With help from Counselor Troi, Barclay may be able overcome his mortal terror, but, sure enough, when he finally does go through with it, he encounters microbes floating in the molecular stream, including what looks like a giant worm with only a mouth that seems to bite him! While Dr. Crusher tries to understand what happened to the engineer (his heart and pulse rate both temporarily surging back to life), she will also have Barclay's physical health to worry about as something has begun to affect his molecular structure, ionic disturbance right around the arm where the worm perhaps touched him. As the story is structured this is about confronting your ultimate fear so you can overcome it, the ability to function better as result of the process. Because Schultz has a knack for parlaying nervous anxiety and innate fear, this story works especially well. And the tailor-made episode especially suited to his character also allows Barclay to become a hero in the possible rescue of the missing crew members. I'm not sure why there haven't been more suspenseful stories centered around the transporter, horrifying things can happen, going back as far Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Plenty of dialogue does revolve around how safe the transporter is as a way to travel, even though Barclay's complaints on the dangers have validity/merit. One small mistake could mean disaster. This episode proves it when the bio-filter doesn't catch the microbes in the stream; this transportation process isn't fool-proof. This episode also has a nice part for Colm Meaney's Chief O'Brien whose record of transporting officers without loss is impeccable, and he does get a bit defensive when Barclay rattles on about the possibilities of tragedy that could result in the slightest miscalculation or problem. His sharing to Barclay of an arachnophobic fear, talking about having to deal with it in order to complete an assignment provides some insight in the O'Brien character. He was on his way to Deep Space Nine.",7
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Realm of Fear (TV Episode 1992)",Barclay saves the day...again,"As with any Barclay episode, your enjoyment of this one depends on your ability to accept that such an intractably neurotic individual would be assigned to the most prestigious starship in the fleet. Even if the guy is a brilliant engineer, wouldn't it be more realistic for him to be working in some innocuous R&D position on, say, Earth? Wouldn't you know it, that is exactly what we eventually see him doing on Star Trek: Voyager.Anyway, Barclay's bad transporter trip and subsequent bout of hypochondria finally push him over the edge, and he is ever-so-gently found unfit for duty by Counselor Troi. Naturally, Barclay can't leave well enough alone, so he rouses the senior staff in the middle of the night to demonstrate how not crazy he is. Fortunately for his Starfleet career and his fragile psyche, he proves that he really did see strange intestinal-looking sock puppet creatures in the transporter beam, and they turn out to be missing crew members from the damaged science ship. Super.Long story short, it's a decent enough episode about facing one's fears, though the underlying message might have been more effective if the plot had revolved around a character who wasn't so high-strung to begin with.",7
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Realm of Fear (TV Episode 1992)",Trouble in the transporter,"When the Enterprise discovers the missing Federation vessel, the USS Yosemite, a team is assembled to beam over. This team includes Reg Barclay, who is terrified of teleporting; so terrified in fact that he initially backs out of going. After talking to Counsellor Troi he plucks up courage to go and the transport goes without incident. However when he beams back he sees what he thinks is a creature in the matter stream; a creature that tries to grab his arm. Chief O'Brien and Geordi reassure him that there is nothing wrong with the equipment and Dr Crusher tells him he hasn't been affected. He continues to worry though, convincing himself that he has 'transporter psychosis' a condition that sometimes occurred with early transporters but hasn't been reported in decades. Eventually he decides there is only one way to be certain; he will transport again.Barclay was the ideal character to lead this episode; we already know he is a rather nervous character so it is of no surprise that he has a phobia about transporting. Dwight Schultz does a great job in the role making us believe in the character's fears. We also get to see more of Chief O'Brien that a typical TNG episode and learn about his own phobia; spiders. This episode is also interesting as it shows us what people see as they are transported; an effect that was pretty good and fitted in with the classic look from outside. When we learn the cause of what Reg saw in the matter stream it was nice that it wasn't in fact some malevolent creature. Overall an interesting episode which is a little different to most as it focuses on an occasional character.",8

guest appearances as the enigmatic Barkley says he has the Enterprise record
for shuttle flights. This all comes up when the Enterprise is called on to a
rescue mission, but finds the small science ship seemingly abandoned.When Schultz transports over there he develops some strange feelings and

psychosomatic but quite real.I did love the resolution of one of my favorite TNG episodes.",8

Well, this scares the crap out of Barkley, as he's always hated the transporter--but this makes his fears so bad that he's about to have a panic attack. When he finally does manage to go there, he sees some REALLY weird slug-like beings while being transported. Naturally, he thinks he's losing his mind and spends A LOT of the episode fretting...a lot! Later, however, he comes to realize that what he saw might be real and it might have something to do with the disappearance of some crew members. This is an okay episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". I have seen other Barkley episodes that were more interesting and memorable. I guess I just found the episode a bit confining (since they didn't go much of anywhere) and found Barkley's worries getting a bit old here.",6

Just as he is about to go, he runs from the transporter room. After Troi teaches him some relaxation techniques, he gives it another try and manages to beam over. One his return, a large wormlike creature with lamprey-like teeth comes at him while he is in the middle of the transport. He is panic stricken but because of his history, he doesn't tell anyone. What is happening to him is a part of the mystery on board the Yosemite. Finally, he needs to know and has O'Brien beam him over and back. The results are pretty amazing.

Could Alkar have something to do with this change and what can be done to stop it?This is an okay episode and clearly was inspired by Oscar Wilde's ""Portrait of Dorian Gray"" but with a very different sort of twist.

2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Man of the People (TV Episode 1992)","A 24th century ""Dorian Gray""","Chip Lucia is ""Alkar"", a Man of the People, an ambassador who seems just as apt as Howie Seago was in ""loud as a whisper""..But where the ambassador from ""loud as a whisper"" was a good and honest person who just happened to have a disability, Alkar is a cheater.Alkar has his mother with him, who instantly and constantly accuses Counselor Troi of trying to hit on Alkar- which is partially true, she appeared to be attracted to him. And he to her, but after his mother dies suddenly, with arms outstretched in a hideous reach, he appears to tone down his interest.He appears to be a concerned negotiator, and a good person. But then Counselor Troi starts undergoing some interesting changes. All we know is that she participated in some kind of funeral meditation with Alkar: which involved the use of two stones which were contained in an ironically coffin-shaped box.This is interesting variation of ""Dorian Gray""- whereas in that original story, the painting was the one that aged, in this rendition it is his ""receptacle"" that ages while he remains young and apparently free from stress.Of course the enterprise crew can't figure out what the blazes is going on, but Dr. Crusher eventually pieces it together and discovers something about Alkar's mother that he was hiding.This was a most interesting episode, and I can forgive the solution, where Troi De-Ages almost as quickly as she had aged- I don't think aging can be undone as easily as shown here, it would have been more correct for the healing to take several days. It did d make for some great special effects, though. The irony here was when Alkar had the tables turned on him, he ended up exactly as his ""mother"" had, with the same hideous grasping reach, arms outstretched as if demanding or pleading for something. Almost like a fish gasping for water, it was hideous and appropriate for Alkar.Alkar seemed to have a unique ability, similar to Counselor Troi's, but in his case it was used to remove his undesired bad emotions from himself. Which would have been acceptable if he had a safe way of getting rid of those, but I would imagine that any form of self improvement that has a cost of trivializing or causing harm to another person, is not much of a self-improvement.Look for Chip Lucia in the Voyager episode ""Alliances"", where he plays a similar character.",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Man of the People (TV Episode 1992)",One of the Worse Episodes,"There is little to like about this episode other than how it ends and it is one of the most prototypical 'filler' episode. This episode introduces Ambassador Alkar, a peace negotiator with a unique ability. He has the power to take all of his negative emotions and channel them through people with telepathic abilities. This channeling of emotions passes the negativity onto his victims, whom he so callously refers to as 'receptacles,' making them unpleasant, aging them rapidly and killing them. He justifies the entire process by claiming that the death of a receptacle is a small price for establishing peace between cultures.While on the Enterprise, Alkar's receptacle, who he tells the crew is his mother, dies. He establishes a link with Troi, who immediately begins acting very angry. It takes only a couple days for Troi to age almost to her death. When Picard confronts Alkar, he is met with extreme egotism and false justification. The only thing good that happens is at the end of the episode. Alkar is quite possibly one of the most vile characters ever on Star Trek. The only thing worse than his ability is the way he justifies it and still demands protection from Picard. When Dr. Crusher reverses what he does, there are very few moments in Star Trek as satisfying as when Alkar ages and dies within a minute as Worf watches. The only thing that hurts the viewer is that Worf is way to honorable to laugh at Alkar in Nelson Muntz style as he dies.",4

The ambassador was travelling to an important peace conference so the Enterprise is given the task of delivering him. Before they can get there the old woman dies and the Ambassador asks Troi to join him in the funeral rites for his mother. As she does something strange happens and afterwards she starts acting strangely; she is attracted to him but her advances are rebuffed; she then takes a crewman to her room and later claws Riker! Her behaviour mirrors that of the Ambassador's mother and both Riker and Dr Crusher wonder if she has caught whatever killed the old woman unfortunately the Ambassador says his species beliefs forbid an autopsy. As time passes Troi's behaviour gets more extreme and she shows signs of aging if she is to be saved Dr Crusher will have to find the cause but by now the Ambassador is engaged in the peace talks, which he refuses to return from.This is a decent enough episode and it was nice to see Marina Sirtis's character, Troi, taking centre stage. The effects of her condition gave her the opportunity to act out of character. The aging effects were pretty good although her 'de-aging' at the end was far too fast to be believable; no doubt at the time this was made the effect was pretty cool but now it seems dated and unnecessary. Charles Lucia does a good job as the Ambassador; playing him in a way that doesn't make it too obvious that he is a villain despite his good intentions.

Doohan returns as ""Scotty,"" who was somehow trapped in mid-transporter transmission during a space battle. Now in the twenty-fourth century, Scotty must adapt to a world that sees him as an antiquity from almost a century before.However, Scotty's engineering wizardry comes into play when Geordi must contend with a Dyson Sphere, a planet encased in a protective armor that has ""swallowed"" the Enterprise.Not only is this installment an homage to the original show, it also is a fitting final TV look at the actor that will forever be associated with the phrase, ""Beam me up!""

Compared to the earlier appearances by his cast mates, DeForrest Kelley (""Encounter at Farpoint"") and Leonard Nimoy (""Unification,"" parts 1 and 2); Doohan's appearance in ""Relics"" was probably the most satisfying of the three for fans of the Star Trek franchise.

The story explored (rather than merely acknowledged) the character.""Relics"" was a great episode for ""Star Trek: the Next Generation."" It provided fans with a nostalgic nod towards the classic ""Star Trek"" series and thoroughly lived up to expectations.",10
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Relics (TV Episode 1992)",Scotty!,"Was thrilled to bits when I was told Scotty was going to be in this and waited in eager anticipation. The brilliantly realized idea of how Scotty saved himself when his ship crashed 75 years ago was an amazing concept. When they return to the Enterprise, Scotty looks around in marvel of how farther technology has come. James Doohan brought warmth and so much depth to the already brilliant character for this episode. The poor man feels a little out of time though as his limited understanding of technology now frustrates poor Geordi in Engineering. Watch for the moment when Scotty tells Geordi to inflate repair times! When Scotty sits at the bar in Ten Forward he is aghast at the taste of his 'Scotch'!! Data quickly intervenes and explains about Synthehol, a alcohol replacement now being served. Scotty later has the Holodeck recreate the original USS Enterprise Bridge. Watch the poor man's face as he enters the Holodeck and look wistfully around and take another swig of his bottle of grog. Picard then enters and they converse about old times. Scotty later saves the ship and sacrifices his own, and later a new invigorated Scotty departs in a Shuttlecraft presented by Picard for sacrificing his to save theirs. Trivia, we hear of 3 Original Trek episodes mentioned by Scotty, 'The Naked Time' when he was in Engineering with Geordi, 'Elaan of Troyius' when he was shown his quarters and 'By Any Other Name' when Data offers him real alcohol which was 'green' in Ten Forward",10
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Relics (TV Episode 1992)",Old habits . . .,"'Relics' is a fine example of a good idea done right. It's the Enterprise making new discoveries (in this case, a Dyson sphere, along with the preserved remains of Montgomery Scott), finding itself in a perilous situation, and relying o the chief engineer to work miracles. Only this time, it's a meeting of minds between Geordi and Mr. Scott. Doohan's is a warm presence, whether he's reminiscing old war stories or waxing nostalgic on the holodeck with the original series bridge. It's a story of an old dog feeling useful again, surmounting ageism and getting the proper sendoff. It's a great story.8/10",8
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Relics (TV Episode 1992)",Coping with change,"After investigating a distress call from a ship that was lost seventy five years previously the Enterprise finds in on the surface of a Dyson Sphere; a huge construction that is as large of the Earth's orbit and contains a star at its centre. When an away team beams down to the crashed ship Geordi discovers that there is somebody in the transporter buffer. When this person is brought out we are greeted by a familiar face; Montgomery Scott! He is keen to see the new Enterprise but it soon becomes apparent that technology has moved on since his time and he soon gets the feeling he is just a relic with no purpose. After having a large drink he retreats to a holographic reconstruction of the bridge of the original Enterprise. Here Picard talks to him before suggesting something he could do to help. Scotty then beams back to his old ship with Geordi in order to access that ship's survey data on the sphere. While they are there the Enterprise activates one of the sphere's systems and is pulled inside. They discover that there is nobody inside and the star has become unstable; there is no obvious way out but ultimately a brave manoeuvre by Scotty saves the day.Fans of the original series are sure to welcome the return of James Doohan as Scotty although they may be concerned that early scenes featuring him show him getting snapped at by Geordi as he makes comments about the operation of the Enterprise that demonstrate his knowledge is out of date. Thankfully this serves to give us a more thoughtful and rather melancholy story as Scotty tries to come to term with the fact that time has moved on. This leads to some great scenes; most notably when he has a drink with Data and Data utters the line 'It is green' when asked what a certain beverage is, and the later scene where he talks to Picard on the bridge of the old Enterprise. It was great that ultimately it is the 'old relic' who saves the day with his old ship. Away from Scotty's return the idea of the Dyson sphere was interesting although I confess that I was a little disappointed that we didn't get to see what life inside the structure may have been like as it had been abandoned. Overall this proved to be a fine episode with a fine performance from a classic character.",9
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Relics (TV Episode 1992)",Relics,"""Relics"", in my opinion, should be considered a Trek treasure. It certainly is an absolute pleasure to watch and revisit over and over. It has so much to say and what a tribute to a beloved actor and character. The late, great James Doohan is such a delight to watch as his Scottish Engineer ""Captain"" Montgomery Scott is ""discovered"" in a wrecked ship's transporter ""pattern buffer"" (the ship landed on a ""Dyson Sphere""more about this in a moment) by Commander Riker, Geordi, and Worf, on board the Jenolan, heavily damaged, with little of the controls/computers still in operation (or are in disrepair). The Enterprise was answering a distress signal from an old ship, missing 75 years, and are caught in the gravitational pull of what Picard believes (and Data backs up) is a Dyson Sphere. The Jenolan was just a transport ship and Scotty was board her, heading for a ""retirement colony"". This sphere has escaped detection for so long because of the sensors inability to scan it due to ""gravimetric interference"". An ""enormous, hollow sphere"" that could be constructed around a star, as Picard informs us of Dyson's theory could be the best description of the mass not far in space from the Enterprise's present location. Data even mentions that if this is a Dyson Sphere, because of its size, it could house 250 Class M planets. It looks like a planetary outer shell, even has a ""door"" (or, perhaps ""hatch"" is more apt), and once the Enterprise uses a simple hailing frequency (hoping lifeforms are inside the sphere to communicate with), it triggers a tractor beam that pulls them inside the sphere and towards the central star within. Before this Picard requests (and is successful) Geordi beam down on the Jenolan with Scotty to try and secure records of the ship's survey of the sphere before their crash. While on the Jenolan, Scotty and Geordi have a chance to see what the Enterprise did wrong (understanding why the sphere pulled them in and how not to make the same mistake), and come up with an answer that will save them from disintegrating entering the star's photosphere.I have to imagine LeVar Burton was having a grand ole time working with Doohan, together getting to come to the Enterprise's rescue. Seeing Scotty on board the Enterprise D, feeling like he doesn't belong and ""in the way"" (as Geordi irritatingly tells him in Engineering), walking onto the recreated NCC-1701 Enterprise in the Holodeck, interacting with Data in Ten Forward while reacting achingly at synthetic scotch (told to him by a ""synthetic man"") before receiving some ""green liquor"" Guinan kept hidden for special occasions, and contemplating his lack of worth in another century, ""Relics"" isn't just a show catered to the character but examines what it is to feel ""outmoded"", out of place, and a dinosaur past your prime. Through his rescue adventure with Geordi, getting the Jenolan active again and actually running, Scotty finds that he's still useful, worth something, and the gift of the shuttle, allowing him to travel and live by his own terms, we get quite a fitting farewell to a splendid character appreciated and loved by Trek fans the world over. Scotty's words of wisdom to Geordi make up some of the episode's most wonderful moments, identifying the thrill to be in charge of keeping a galaxy class starship going, knowing that it doesn't last forever. Also noteworthy is Scotty's chat with Picard, both reminiscing about their first ship and how it felt and still feels.",10

When they activate the controls, they are able to beam someone out of the transporter--good old Scotty from the original Enterprise. It seems he and another man were the last survivors and to stay alive, they put themselves into the transporter....75 years ago! Unfortunately, the other guy did not survive this and now Scotty has to get used to life in an all new century. Unfortunately, it soon becomes apparent that he's almost hopelessly out of date. Even worse, however, is that Commander LaForge isn't all that patient with Scotty when he comes to engineering. In fact, he's very short with him. Sure, Scotty is annoying but LaForge is not especially kind--and all this is very painful to watch. Fortunately, the rest of the show does improve and Mr. Scott is able to prove himself in the end. Overall, the show is a bit painful to watch but enjoyable...especially for fans of the old series.",7

He is utterly fascinated by the advanced technology and begins running around, literally pushing buttons, to the chagrin of Jordi LaForge (the chief engineer). Of course, Picard knows that there is nothing worse than an old man who feels he has no purpose in life. Of course, we know that his machismo and expertise are going to come into play at some point. While it's fun to see him running around the ship, telling war stories, trying to find true Scotch whiskey, there are times when old characters should be left to their series.

12,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Relics (TV Episode 1992)","Great episode, but the writers are clearly Pro-Next Gen","An excellent episode that should be a fan favourite. But the writing and some of the interactions on the show are nothing but disappointing. First of all the title, Relics. This is a slap at the TOS basically describing Scotty as a has been, and no where near as good as LaForge or the Next Gen crew. LaForge is written entirely out of character, acting like an engineer on a modern nuclear aircraft carrier, talking with a cold war engineer. Laforge should have reverence for this man, as being the prototype miracle worker. On top of it, they paint Scotty as always over estimating his repair times, so he gets more respect. What??? I for one am shocked that Doohan would have allowed his character to be portrayed this way. The fact he was smart enough to keep himself alive by using a transporter in diagnostic mode shows Scotty indeed knew his stuff. The interaction with Picard saves this episode, comparing first commands or first loves of old starships and sharing a wee dram on the holodeck. The fact that Picard had to ""chew out"" Laforge once again shows how much Laforge was out of character. This could of been so much better.

The mystery of what was happening to Riker was intriguing; and, the gathering of the puzzle pieces by the members of the crew led to some chilling revelations. It has often been said that the most frightening enemies are the ones you cannot see; and, the ones in this story were certainly more than enough to make a viewer's skin crawl.Members of the Enterprise crew were able to solve the mystery of what was going on without figuring out why it was happening. For some viewers, this may be perceived as a shortcoming of the story. For others, it might be perceived as meaning that some mysteries will always remain beyond the boundaries of the knowledge of man, even in the 24th century.The classic episode, ""Relics,"" was broadcast only a week earlier; so, ""Schisms"" had to live up to unusually high expectations from viewers. However, the episode still managed to stand on its own, providing viewers with a very disturbing story. Furthermore, the scene in which Data performed his poetry reading is probably one of the more memorable moments in the entire series. Overall, the episode is well worth viewing.",8

The moment where Riker realizes he and other crew members have been being taken by ""clicky"" aliens is chilling.

A subspace rift is discovered in one of the cargo bays which is inevitably linked to the crew's problems. It turns out that aliens are sedating crew members and taking them to a different universe to experiment on.This was a distinctly creepy episode, especially in the scene where the effected crew members go to the holodeck and create the table they vaguely remember from their time away this doesn't sound disturbing but as the each make corrections it changes from an innocent looking dining table to a strange device on which people are restrained and experimented on. Things are no less creepy when we see what happens to Riker the final time he is taken when stimulants keep him awake. It isn't all creepy though; there are some laughs to be had; mostly when Riker struggles to stay awake during Data's poetry recital.

This starts out with a terrific sense of dread that really builds from there - a problem among the crew that worsens and suddenly deepens into an abduction scenario. The mystery here is well-handled, even if the captors are little more than crab people. But it also leaves the story on an unsettling ellipsis.

It always amazes me to find our guys Geordi and Data coming up with an endless stream of options to a problem they've never encountered. None of these make any sense to me. Do they to anyone?

To speed up charting this region, Geordi has come up with a way using warp energy to enhance censors to reach longer distances more quickly. What happens is that a strange ""existence"" from deep subspace (emitting tetryon particles, particles that shouldn't exist in normal space) is starting to form in Cargo Bay 4, a rift begins to open and threatens to cause a hull breach if not closed. Meanwhile—and this is where it really gets disturbing—members of the crew (Riker, Worf, Geordi, and a few other selected members) are ""losing time"", and it could have something to do with the rupture in Cargo Bay 4. The scene I consider particularly unsettling is when the crew members converge in the Holodeck with Counselor Troi to construct the table and the feeling of entrapment (and the sounds that exist around it) that haunt them. Riker's loss of sleep is the catalyst that slowly leads to the mystery's unraveling, with Geordi's visors ""cutting out"" and an infection setting up around his neural inputs, Worf's unnerving reaction to a barber's scissors, and Data's inability to count for 90 minutes (a signature that detects his presence on the ship was missing during that time) all confirming that whatever is happening to them it started when Cargo Bay 4 began to feature the subspace rupture. The existence of ""curious alien lifeforms"" unable to exist in the universe of the Enterprise crew recalls the accounts of humans being experimented on by aliens (Fire in the Sky), and the photography inside the ""testing facility"" (and the robed aliens with their clicking ""voices"" communicating to each other during experimentation, study, and research) purposely evokes a sense of dread and terror. Schisms is totally an absorbing, fascinating experience because of how the plot unfolds like a mystery giving the viewer more and more details until we get the whole puzzle solved. The episode ends with the idea that these curious aliens sent off a probe to further study the universe they are unable to currently occupywith a member of the crew dead, another having an arm severed and re-attached, it's creepy to think that sooner or later they might find a way to exist in the universe of the Enterprise.",8

On board the Enterprise is Amanda, who is shown immediately to have some interesting powers (retrieving and sending back her pets to some unknown place--possibly like the cloud). She is a bright, pretty 18 year old who is newly arrived from Star Fleet Academy, working with Dr. Crusher. Q informs the crew that she is Q and is being observed by the masters to see if she should live or die. She is the daughter of adoptive parents because her actual parents were destroyed by the Continuum. Q asks to be her to allow him to be her tutor. She is caught between her need to be human and the powers that she has inherited. She develops a connection with Beverly and tries to sort out all he implications--a decision which will eventually determine what she will become. This is what makes this episode provocative. Q is his usually obnoxious self, treating the girl with a heavy hand (she seems to have powers that are a step above his). What would we do if we found ourselves with these gifts.",8

over young Olivia D'Abo who is studying under Dr. Crusher and showing she's got
certain powers and abilities quite out of the ordinary. Q wants D'Abo for the

Although I never understood why Picard hated him so much, he was often very helpful to the crew and the shows were pretty fun. I would consider ""True Q"" to be among the least of these episodes--worth seeing but less fun than usual.The show begins with a bright young lady, Amanda Rogers (Olivia d'Abo) coming aboard the ship and working with the Doctor. It seems that she's some sort of prodigy and the Doctor is teaching her. However, in the middle of this, Q unexpectedly arrives and announces that Amanda is NOT a human but actually a member of the Continuum. And, because of this, he's ready to take her back to be with her people. While this means a lot of power...it also is not an easy choice for Amanda. Interestingly, the Captain doesn't argue with Q but gives him full access to the ship...which he would have taken anyway.The biggest problem is the Q is just too restrained in this one and the show is much more serious in tone.

It soon becomes apparent that it isn't just telekinesis; Q turns up claiming that Amanda is actually a Q. She knew that her natural parents had died when she was a baby but had no idea that they were Q who had chosen to live as human. Q is on a mission to determine whether she is fully Q or whether her human birth means she is something else. He tutors her to use her abilities but doesn't tell her that her parents were killed by the Q and the same fate will await her if she continues to use her powers without returning to the continuum.The Q have the potential to be one of the most annoying Star Trek aliens thanks to their omnipotence but John de Lancie manage to save the Q we see most of; making him an interesting and amusing character. The fact that Amanda is only coming to terms with being a Q at this point makes her character interesting too; Olivia d'Abo does a decent job in the role even though the character isn't the most dynamic.

It's clear that they were going for something light-hearted with a title like that, but it's the execution that's a problem. The science involved is flimsy (it's just there to explain the problem away) and even though the child actors are able, the absence of Patrick Stewart just saps this of any dramatic wright.

One could actually believe them to be their adult counterparts.Star Trek TNG is my favorite show of the series, followed by Voyager. With a very elegant ship and excellent actors, TNG also quickly did away with the mini-skirt costumes, thank goodness, paving the way to more respect for the women of the future and for Voyager to break ground being the first to have several female characters in the major roles of captain, engineer and science officer. A great role model show for developing young women today.Getting back to this episode, I found it one of the series most entertaining.",10

Several delightfully awkward moments between O'Brien and young Kieko as well as Riker and young Picard. Speaking of Riker, it seems his inability to fight off Klingon Birds of Prey while in charge of a Galaxy Class star ship precedes Generations. Worf needs target practice. In fact, the enterprise crew ought to be court marshaled for allowing the Ferngi to gain control of the ship so easily.

Watching the crew's reaction to Picard in particular was quite funny, especially his first scene on the bridge. Keiko's exasperation with her husband, Miles is a scream as well. Poor guy is uncomfortable sitting with a twelve year old girl! The younger Keiko emulates Rosalind Chao spot on though. Isis Jones pulls off one hell of a performance as the 'small' Guinan and takes full advantage of being 12! Megan Parlen as the younger Ensign Ro even pulls off one of her turns on one heel and walks away!

This is a puzzle for sure, but when a couple Klingon vessels attack and ultimately board the ship, they have bigger troubles. As it turns out, it is not the Klingons; it is a group of Ferengi rogues who have commandeered the old Klingon vessels and now have moved on to the Enterprise, the purpose to sell it to the Romulans. The regular crew is transported to a planet that was to be explored and the children are left behind, among them the four mini-adults. Of course, the plot takes an expected route when the Ferengi begin to be too comfortable on the ship, full of themselves as usual. It allows the children (who are in grave danger) to begin a plot that feeds off the stupidity of the Ferengi. This is one of those just plain fun episodes that isn't to be taken too seriously, but there is still an element of danger.",9
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Rascals (TV Episode 1992)",Miles O'Brien is given a Middle Name.,"Premise: Four Next Generation characters are reverted to Children, but keep their adult memories.Everyone who watches this episode says ""I Wish"". Most of us would want to stay that way, I know I would.But there is always one person who will be a Party-Pooper: Here, it is Ro Laren. In Sharp Contrast to Guinan who is having the time of her 500- year plus life. But Ro has a point. Most of us when remembering Childhood don't have fond memories of it, because we were short, awkward, and bumbled around until we were 17 or so. Ro can't be blamed much, because her Childhood included starvation, torture, terrorism, and finally escape from an internment camp much like Velos II. But as far as Guinan is concerned, she knows how to make any situation into a party, which she does here and drags Ro right along with her.David Birkin makes another appearance on Trek, originally he was Picard's nephew Rene in the 4th Season 2nd episode ""Family"". This is ideal, as there would be a family resemblance- This gives the episode a lot of clout, especially when dealing with Picard.As far as Keiko, Ro and Guinan, Caroline Junko King from ""3 Ninjas Kick Back"" looks a lot like a younger Rosalind Chao (Despite really being Japanese). Megan Parlen from ""Hang Time"" does a very convincing Mini-Ro, but the prize goes to Isis Jones as Young Guinan- and in fact the only other film or Television credit she has is for playing a younger version of Whoopi Goldberg in ""Sister Act 2"".It wasn't enough just to find kids that looked like Picard, Keiko, Ro and Guinan - The physical attributes were not enough to make us believe that these were all younger versions of our principles victims of the week's conundrum - It was the way these kids actually became our four ""Conundrumites"" down to the last earring of Ro's and Facepalm of Picard's.Megan and Isis when having their little arguments are a lot like Whoopi and Michelle when they first met in Ten Forward. Isis is intrusive and gets right into Ro's business- Just like Guinan did to Ro in her debut episode.Caroline and Colm are still ""Mr and Mrs O'Brien"" and Caroline's every movement is what Keiko would do, down to the pulling of Colm's ear.And David Birkin's Picard is nothing else but perfect, especially in talking to his Number One ""Dad"" Riker.It was all just so much fun- if anything, Trek is supposed to be fun as well as whatever else it is- and here, it is.As far as the other aspect of this episode goes: The Enterprise D could easily vaporize two old Klingon Jalopies. And of course, the D was taken by surprise. We can suspend disbelief by just assuming these Ferengi were Lucky Shots. Ultimately, they were merely Ferengi and outsmarted themselves. Mike Gomez is Daimon Lurin, who is ""In Business for Himself"" and not part of the Ferengi Alliance. I never thought actual members of the Ferengi Alliance would be as stupid as he was, even though they had been ""Foolish"" a number of times. But here they are bumbling, inept fools. Tracey Walter re-appears again as a Ferengi, this time ""Berik"", and one other, ""Morta"" played by Michael Snyder.This episode is a clear revelation of what happens when The Three Stooges try to take over a Galaxy Class Starship - They get their asses handed to them on platters by Kids.

Mini Picard less so and mini Keiko was not really believable.The reason I didn't rate this higher was a number of eye-rolling moments. The Enterprise's shield power is all over the place in various episodes, but in this one it was particularly weak. It took only a couple of Klingon ship phaser strikes to knock it out? Really?And then there was Worf, missing a Ferengi with his phaser at a distance of only 15 feet or so? Come on.

Gates McFadden thinks with a little work, some genetic readjustment they can be restored.

It has some good moments. Ferengi: ""I'm not stupid, HUMAN"". Rike: ""No, of course not."" Well, the funny is in the delivery.I think what bothers me most about this episode though isn't even how silly it is that a transporter malfunction caused 4 people to materialize as adolescents (and where the hell did that ""energy field"" come from that caused it?) But the thing is, this is what everybody has dreamed of for centuries. A fountain of youth. They would be able to simple grow again into adults. Chief O'Brian has discovered immortality, and all they can do is fret as if their lives are over and look for a ""cure"" to this problem.Troy does mention that this ""could be considered a gift"". Yeah, no kidding. It's not like they have a terminal disease. All they get is a replay of youth without losing any of the memory or skills they've acquired.And that's maybe the most fun thing about this episode, is makes you imagine how you would react given the same opportunity.

While Dr Crusher works to find a way to fix what happened those affected and those around them are having to deal with the changes; it is hard for those on the bridge to take orders from a child and Chief O'Brien is understandably disturbed to find himself married to a twelve year old! Just as the doctor thinks she has come up with a solution the Enterprise is attacked by two Klingon warships. The Enterprise is then boarded but not by Klingons; a group of Ferengi seize the ship with the intention of making a nice profit. Most of the adult crew are beamed down to the surface of a planet leaving just a handful of crewmembers and the children aboard. This does of course mean that Picard is still aboard to lead a plan to retake the ship in a way that takes advantage of the childlike appearance of himself and the other three who were on the shuttle with him.I thought this was going to be an annoying child-centred episode but it turned out to be rather fun because the characters weren't emotionally and mentally immature; just physically. This led to plenty of amusing moments; Picard realising his voice was rather squeaky and his pretending to be Riker's son to trick the Ferengi were particular highlights. It isn't all played for laughs as we see Keiko having to deal with the fact that her daughter doesn't recognise her and the relationship with her husband will fundamentally change. There are also some nice scenes between Guinan and Ro as the former encourages the latter to stop sulking and enjoy her chance of a second childhood as her first hadn't been good. The fact that the Ferengi left the children aboard was of course rather convenient but lead to more good scenes and a nice resolution to the story.

The reason why The Western is still one of the most popular forms of Fiction is the same reason why Science Fiction is equally as popular, and especially Star Trek, which was and still is basically Wagon Train in Space.This is one of Braga's best scripts, despite incurring the wrath of Trek fans with unpopular explosions of the Enterprise D and taking one shows finale episode and making it a Next Generation episode. I don't care, he is still a fine writer and some of the best and most loved episodes of Trek are his ideas.Like this episode.Counselor Troi is ""Durango"" - and looks great poured into Leather Chaps like Michele Carey wore as ""Joey"" in El Dorado. I loved that Troi had transformed herself into a character that was far from Troi - If she had been around in 1966, she could have been Joey. - No Problem.This Holodeck Program - One of Broccoli's, his fault as usual, is a Vulcan Mind Meld of El Dorado and Rio Bravo. Can Worf ever replace The Duke? In this episode, YES. He should have been given an Eye Patch.Of course, you could look at it as ""Just Another Holodeck gone Haywire"" 'Sode, but despite the superfluity of those kinds of shows on Trek, this one is probably the best, as the storyline within the Holodeck Program closely follows events happening on The Ship. This had never been done for any of the previous faulty-Holo Eps.Perhaps it was not the best time for Data to try to plug himself into the Ship's Systems and try to run them. I giggled when Crusher's Play had been overwritten with Data's ""Ode to Spot"" poetry, and I howled with laughter with increasing decibels each time Data started taking on Characteristics of the Holo-Novel.John Piper-Ferguson is ""Eli Hollander"", the first crook Worf must toss into the Hoosegow, with his Sidekick Bandito Jorge Cervera Jr. Joy Garrett is ""Miss Annie"", a representation of Angie Dickinson's ""Feathers"" from Rio Bravo. Of course, each Howard Hawks film has some kind of ""Kid"" which was James Caan in El Dorado. In this case, it is Worf's Son Alexander Rozhenko.And of course, the Main Bad guy is... Well, you'll have to watch it, but the title of the Episode gives enough clues about what is really about.What amazes me is that the Location shooting was done all in one day, making Picard a great director as well as a great Captain.This episode successfully merges the concept of Space Exploration and The Old West, two subjects that are as two peas in similarity. From the early 1800's to the 1870's the United States was one vast unexplored region, like the Alpha Quadrant from The Original Trek and Next Generation. The Native Tribes were our aliens, and Canada and Mexico were at times our Vulcans, Klingons, Romulans or Cardassians.And the Comedy aspects are quite similar to many Howard Hawks movies, especially his uncredited work on Howard Hugh's ""The Outlaw"", ""Only Angels have Wings"", and even ""Ball of Fire"" and ""His Girl Friday"".Because the people who worked on Star Trek had helped make some of the great films of the 30's through the 60's and Brannon has given them all a curt nod of appreciation here, as Star Trek was made on the same lot that some of these great films were also made.At the time this episode was made, Trek was a huge franchise and probably at it's peak of popularity. Of course there are silly things here, but the overall effect is enough to suspend disbelief, back when it was originally shown and today when I can watch the DVDs.Brent Spiner of course is in true form, and is a long way from his humble beginnings as the Hick Father in Night Court.",10

That is, they go back to the Old West as a Sheriff and his deputy. At first, it is easy, because he simply punches out the bad guy. But Alexander doesn't like it because it is too easy. So they up the odds by making the holodeck program more sophisticated. Unfortunately, as often happens, a glitch occurs in engineering and they are left to fend for themselves. Also, all the bad guys begin to look like Data because it was during the use of his positronic brain that all this took place (he was wired to the computer and images of him are being sent to the holodeck). What occurs is a predictable shootout between Worf and the data/father of the young gunfighter that is in jail. There is one really good line. I'll paraphrase. The bad guy looks at Worf and says, ""Is that your face or was your mother scared by an armadillo."" The great humor is watching Worf use his stuffy dialect to speak to the characters. It is such a contrast. Back on board, Data begins to act like a stereotypical movie cowboy. Great fun. Deanna also plays a gunslinging woman who is just as formidable as the others.",8

'A Fistful of Datas' has a few things working in its favor. For one, it's the crew having fun with an old west tale (and making use of the backlot and SoCal sunshine); two, Patrick Stewart in the director's chair, which helps keep spirits high; three, the pitch-perfect casting of John Pyper-Ferguson, and this was probably the audition tape for his stint on ""Brisco County Jr."" But having Data go haywire allows Brent Spiner to mug for the camera and do funny voices.

All the holographic characters turn into Datas with super human powers included. The replicators on deck 4 though 9 are producing nothing but cat food. Worf MacGyvers a personal force field out of a holographic telegraph and his communicator before shooting a gun out of Datas hand. His aim is noticeably improved over the previous episode Rascals.

They manage to take him in with help from passing stranger, Counsellor Troi, but things start to go wrong soon afterwards. The Gunslinger's father turns up and he looks familiar in fact he looks like Data but he isn't Data. It soon becomes apparent that Data's experiments with the ship's computer have had a few unexpected consequences and they could prove fatal to Worf as he finds himself in a gunfight with an opponent with Data's speed the safeties off!.Episodes where the holodeck safeties fail can be disappointing but this was rather fun thanks to the say Data starts talking like the holodeck gunslinger in the real world as well as gradually replacing the various characters in the holodeck; Brent Spiner did a great job in the role and was clearly having fun acting out of his usual character; the final moment where the 'love interest' character was replaced by Data was hilarious for the viewer if not for Worf! Michael Dorn does a fine job as Worf; it was nice to see how his character grew to enjoy his Wild West adventure.

However, Geordi and Data are anxious to use this time to tinker with the ship's systems. They want to try tying the control of the ship through Data--and it ends up corrupting the system instead. While some of this is just a minor annoyance, such as replacing the food in the replicators with cat food, Worf, Alexander and the Counselor are on a holodeck adventure in the old west--and because of the corruption, the program becomes all too real. The normal safety protocols no longer work and they could end up getting killed. Can Sheriff Worf save kidnapped Deputy Alexander before the gang of Datas blow they to kingdom come?The word 'slight' is exactly what comes to mind with this one. It is a silly and incredibly dopey episode. Fortunately, the works better than you'd expect because the show does have a nice sense of humor--which goes into overdrive near the end.

As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 06This sixth somehow seems to have hold down the train of enthralling compartments, the concepts are still fresh and comes in with new perspective but unfortunately the storytelling isn't as engaging as the previous seasons.A Fistful Of DataAn homage to Sergio Leone's beloved genre finds the right amount of balance on blending in the western and sci-fi genre, the result is not Westworld like but definitely entertaining and surprisingly also funny at times.",

Even though the Enterprise is in grave danger, he refuses to allow them to work. Once again, the definition of what life is comes into play.

Data is intrigued and they work with the device. It later malfunctions and a moment later the conduit it was working in explodes. It is brought back to the Enterprise and Data later discovers it has repaired itself, but had also disabled itself earlier. Puzzled, Data asks the computer why the Exocomp would disable itself and then repair itself. The computer does not have an answer. Realizing that they might be alive a test is set up and the Exocomp fails and Doctor Farallon is vindicated. Data retests the unit exhaustively and only a timely intervention by Crusher allows the Exocomp to return without a order to do so. Data is surprised and is amazed to discover the Exocomp knew there was no danger and completed the repair and disabled the false overload signal for the test. Data later puts on one of his best shows when he risks Geordi and Captain Picard by preventing the Exocomps being used as a torpedo to stop the particle stream. Riker eventually agrees to give the Exocomps a choice. They later save Geordi and Picard and sacrifice one of their own to do so in a touching scene. Data later apologizes to Picard for risking his life but Picard commends him and says it was one of the most human decisions he's ever made. Brilliant stuff.

Can he adapt? Is he Aware of his circumstances? As we saw then, if he meets any of those criteria in the smallest degree, we must agree he is alive.But Dr. Farallon, Ellen Bry from St Elsewhere, has created a tool - A tool as useful as our PCs and Laptops and iPhones. She shows one to Geordi who is impressed, but when they try to show it to Data, it apparently malfunctions.Dr. Farallon is working on a ""Particle Fountain"" and her tools, her ""Exocomps"" have been her helpers. Data inspects the one that had failed, and it turns out that the machine had shut off a part of itself - To preserve it's existence. Dr Farallon has said that the new circuit pathways in it's memory are a form of corruption, and it must be wiped.But Data sees that the new pathways are not a corruption at all, he thinks that the machines are developing intelligence.This is the cause of major friction between Farallon and Data, in the meantime the Particle Fountain is falling to bits, and as no humans can enter the areas that need repair, the Exocomps must do the work. But Data asks that the Exocomps not be exploited as they seem to be developing life forms. So Picard agrees to an ""Intelligence Test"" - Which the Exocomp also apparently fails.The Problem was, the Exocomp has seen right through the fake test! But there was no way to see that until Data is distracted by Dr Crusher - the Exocomp returns by itself - With a different tool than the one that was initially programmed into the 'Comp.When our PCs start acting up, we ""Ctrl-Alt-Delete"" or ""Format c:"" - How many of us have seen inherent behaviors in our PCs operating systems? Every computer I have ever used has developed a ""personality"" - Where I can predict almost to the second, where, when and why it will do something unexpected - Sometimes to my benefit, other times to my detriment.Data enforces his protection of these small machines, even when Picard is trapped on the fountain with Geordi and they cannot beam back. He refused to allow the Exocomps to be blown up in an attempt to shut it down - But he WILL ""Ask Them"" if they are willing to try to shut down the fountain core.Fortunately, they have a better solution than just exploding themselves.It seems to me I have seen these things, in other shows, and in the IMDb Trivia they, or rather, their props, had been used 10 years later for something else.In 1990 or so when this episode was shown, all we had were some Apple LC-IIs - If even those were around back then - And PC's running 80286's with DOS. Only very large supercomputers had been used for any type of AI tests.But now it is 2013, and I just installed Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1, and right from the start, it shows a remarkable amount of apparent intelligence. Of course, this is an illusion programmed into the Speech Kit based on Visual Basic scripts, Dot Net Programs, and Macros. But still - If I tell it to start any program it recognizes, it starts, and closes. I can tell it to stop hearing me and even lock the screen. I can invoke my screen-saver, based on a macro I found.How much longer, until my computer starts back-talking me? How long until I can talk to it in a conversational tone and get the illusion of intelligent conversation out of it... And how long until that Illusion gives way to real intelligence? Out of respect for my machines, I never shut them down, each boot cycle is a lifespan to the machine, it forgets everything on the next reboot. And now I can talk to my iPhone, will it start insulting me randomly? There is even a modification to allow this.What is great about this episode, other than the appearance of Ellen Bry, is that 24 years later, the very computers we use today are just beginning to have this illusion of intelligence. As CPUs, Hard Drives, Ram and other memory devices get smaller and their capacities increase, the nearer we some to the day when we *will* have to ask our computer's permission to do the tasks we have been taking for granted. What then? will we treat our creations as slaves, or as partners in life, with respect?I hope it will be the latter.",10

As Data investigates this, he realizes that the Exocomps might be alive! Soon, Data goes to the point where he defends the Exocomps, even to the point where he disobeys orders. Watch this ethically-charged episode to see what happens as the Enterprise debates what the definition of life is.Trivia note: Geordi is continuing to grow his beard (a discussion on beards occur during the crew's regular poker game).

Thankfully, though, ""The Quality of Life"" doesn't have the annoying Alexander (doubtlessly the worst part of ""Cost of Living"").",

This would add months to the work so Farallon proposes using one of her experimental 'Exocomp' robots. These advanced devices are capable of identifying the problem and replicating the right tool for the job so the problem is solved in minutes. Impressed with the device Geordi encourages Dr Farallon to show it to Capt Picard on the Enterprise. To demonstrate the device she tries to use it to carry out a repair but the device returns with the task unfinished and shuts down its interface. Shortly afterwards there is an explosion at the site the repair was needed; Farallon thinks this is a coincidence but Data wonders if the device refused as an act of self-preservation a possible sign that it is sentient. Analysis shows that shortly afterwards the exocomp repaired its interface and shows signs that it had been rewriting its own programming. To test this theory it is asked to carry out further repairs with simulated accidents but this time it continued working as told Farallon takes this as a sign that the device is just a machine while Data isn't so sure and continues to experiment and becomes so convinced that they are 'alive' that he blocks their use in an action that would sacrifice them to save Geordi and Capt. Picard!This is one of those episode that is about issues more than action; whether you enjoy it will depend on how interesting you find the issue and whether or not you agree with the programmes opinion on the matter. The idea of devices becoming sentient isn't a new one; indeed Data himself has been a centre of a debate about the nature of life and the rights of androids. This is slightly different though; the exocomps don't look human or act in an obviously alive manner. The story is handled in an interesting way although there are certain aspects that seemed a little off most notably Picard's observation that Data was at his most human when he refused to sacrifice the exocomps to save his friends I'm sure most humans would have used them even if they knew they were sentient. The exocomps were nicely designed, cute but not overly so, however their movement did look rather unrealistic. Overall and interesting story but not one of the series' most gripping.",7

The particle fountain is something of a death trap as every scene on board the station involves a malfunction of one kind or another. Exo-comps are easier to configure for explosions than photon torpedoes. Data values the exo-comps lives over that of his captain and best friend but is willing to sacrifice himself, Picard is cool with it. Exo-comps can be transported to the particle fountain but humans cannot be transported away. I am sure that last plot point is adequately hand waived away as something other than plot necessity.

8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Quality of Life (TV Episode 1992)",Technical ignorance leads to distorted morality,"This a another in a series of episodes (of Star Trek: Next Generation and others) displaying technical ignorance about computers and deriving thereby erroneous moral conclusions.A computer is a machine programmed by people to perform according to a set of rules - called a program. The program by definition is a compilation of preset logical pathways that lead to the (hopefully) desired results. This is no different than a calculator or a modern washing machine with a digital control panel. It is certainly not a life form.Now, many ignorant people will interject: what about artificial intelligence? And what about self-awareness? Don't these give a computer the type of intelligence and self-concern that a person has?The answer is a resounding: NO.Artificial intelligence means that the program has added levels of analysis algorithms and the ability to select and combine from experience and hypothetical possibilities. This simulates human creativity, but ONLY to the degree, and governed by, the programmed instruction that were devised by a human being with the inherent limitations of his understanding, limited time and finite logic. The AI computer will be a mechanical and very very limited simulation of what the human programmed - including his own errors and finite understanding. Again: not a life form , but a limited simulation, with NO mind or identity of its own.Next, someone will ask: what if we program self-awareness into the computer (or android)? The answer is that the ""self-awareness mechanisms"" are just that: mechanisms, programmed routines whereby the computer or robot has pre-conceived, limited guidelines to ""take care"" of its own survival. Again: pre-programmed - not emotions or identity-driven. Even the ability to change its own program or add to its own physical systems would be mechanisms that are pre-programmed and bounded by the understanding and limited capabilities of the finite lines of programming coded by the programmer.No matter how sophisticated the algorithms or powerful the computing power, programmed machines are no more than virtual reality - like a great actor that portrays a character in a totally believable way. No matter how well done, we all know that he couldn't even remotely live his actual life externally and particularly emotionally, as that character - because it is a pre-written limited role that is narrowly defined by the writer - NOT a full-depth and independent unpredictable person with a will of its own. Therefore the actor can at best only give a limted performance for a given defined set of circumstances that the writer conceived and ""programmed"".Such are the attempt to ""create"" self-aware AI robots. They are unfathomably limited in their choices, can be given only a pre-conceived simulated identity and can only simulate a person. This is why the writers of such shows usually endow the important robots ""characters"", like Data, with simulated personalities, physical attractiveness and ""cute"" mannerisms, so as to enhance believability in their ""humanity"", as a great actor would do. They are both nothing but illusions.The attempt to classify such virtual reality robots as life forms is an expression of ignorance and an assault on the dignity and value of true life forms, particularly sentient beings.",3

It is intended merely to point out that it could have been a catastrophe, when in fact this show singlehandedly resurrected the entire franchise by taking the fandom of the original series and challenging them. And this is demonstrated to incredible effect with the epic two-part adventure.It may at first seem implausible that an ageing captain, a doctor with no combat experience and a chief security officer would be sent on a dangerous espionage mission, but thanks to the script good, justifiable reasons are provided and they set the stage. The Federation is finally revealed to be strained; stretching to meet bigger and more avaricious foes. The Enterprise crew is forced to work harder, faster and better to meet the challenge when Picard is replaced. Riker becomes an intermediary, an emissary for the misgivings of the crew. His stunning ambition and Kirk-esquire attitude send sparks flying when Jellico (played stunningly by Ronny Cox) steamrollers over the comfortable routine.After an immaculate setup, the second part delivers on the promise. Sweeping narrative is something Star Trek excels at, and it is no wonder that that last three seasons of TNG contain more two-part episodes than the four that precede it. The two main plots have been intertwined well - both the away mission to discover a Cardassian base and the shake-up of the Enterprise mirror each other in intention, but work so well because of such contrasting execution - notice the extensive use of dark and light between the plots. Both share a common factor - they are guessing games.In the second part, they become cat-and-mouse games. Jellico must negotiate a workable agreement with the Cardassians, Picard must endure torture of the most degrading sort - not just physical pain, but mental manipulation too. In both cases, the tormentor and the tormented change during the course of the episode, masterfully. When one appears to be holding all the cards, external factors are altered and force a radical rethinking of survival tactics. Both Captains are forced to look inward, to reconsider what they think is right and to admit at least a little defeat to achieve an advantageous goal (Jellico must barter with Riker, Picard must hold on to his hope while wearing down Gul Madred).I could single out and extrapolate on so many great nuances of performance in many of the cast, but I would no doubt run out of words to do so. As someone who has a huge amount of respect for Patrick Stewart - not just an actor, but the highest class of the art, a true thespian - I will concentrate on that.Patrick Stewart has often been responsible for the best moments of any work he happens to be in. Even the more mediocre works can be raised by one of his grandstanding, completely compelling speeches. He had always been a strong lead character and Star Trek gave him the exposure he needed to really capitalise on his skills. Here he is given a sparring partner so evenly matched the tension of his scenes - with David Warner as Gul Madred - are a sight to behold. The facial expressions, the subtle vocal inflections and the haunted look one man demonstrates when the other manages a riposte he could not have anticipated - this raises the medium of the television show to the heights of classical theatre.Both run the gamete of emotions - anger, passion, love, hatred, despair and many more - and it makes for compelling viewing. The tension between the scenes with Jonathan Frakes and Ronny Cox comes very close to matching these heights too: with both plots seamlessly edited together and topped off with an exceptional musical score, the end result is mesmerising.I remember seeing these episodes as a child and being completely captivated by the moral questions raised, wondering what I might make of the work the next time I saw it. This has been one of the rare cases where age and experience have barely dented my reactions and enjoyment, still forcing me to turn inwards after viewing and consider what my own passions and commitments might be worth in the grand scheme of things. If that isn't what great works of art are supposed to do, then I suppose I'll never know. Bravo. Hats off to everyone involved.",9
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Chain of Command: Part I (TV Episode 1992)",Great performances all around.,"ST:TNG:136 - ""Chain Of Command, Part I"" (Stardate: 46357.4) - this is the 10th episode of the 6th season of Star Trek: The Next Generation.As the tensions between the Federation and Cardassians rise (foreshadowing the debut of ""Deep Space Nine"" a few weeks after this 2-part episode), Picard is relieved of command of the Enterprise to go on a secret mission into Cardassian territory along with Dr. Crusher and Worf.Meanwhile, Captain Jellico (played smartly by Ronny Cox of ""Beverly Hills Cop"", ""Robocop"", ""Total Recall"" fame) is given command of the Enterprise by Vice Admiral Alynna Nechayev (played by Natalia Nogulich, in her first of 4 TNG performances). Tensions immediately rise between the new captain and Riker.However, after Picard and crew arrives at the forbidden planet, Picard walks into a trap and is captured by the ruthless Gul Madred (played ingeniously by Star Trek veteran David Warner).Trivia note: Riker notes that there is a standard 3 shift rotation on the Enterprise. This is also the episode where Troi starts wearing her standard uniform (because of Jellico's rules).",
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Chain of Command: Part I (TV Episode 1992)",One of the Best Episodes of the Entire Series,"Note: This review covers both parts of ""Chain of Command"".Picard is replaced as captain of the Enterprise. He, Lt. Worf and Dr. Crusher go on a secret mission into Cardassian space. His replacement, Capt. Jellico, meets his new command with some resistance from the crew. The Cardassians use theta band emissions as a ruse to lure Capt. Picard into their hands and begin brutal rounds of torture to gain the information they seek.Why is this one of the best episodes of the entire series? Because it has plenty of action while not holding back on quality writing. We get more insight into Riker's personality and how emotional he can get when confronted with an authority he doesn't respect. And we further learn to what lengths Picard will go to defend the Federation and Dr. Crusher. How one interprets Riker is open to debate -- is he a loose cannon, a maverick? Is he unreliable? Or is he simply confident? Picard insists time and again that ""there are four lights"" (which is true) despite intense pain all over his body. He has a great dedication to his crew, his mission and the truth. We really see that he can be both tough and compassionate at the same time.As with many ""Next Generation"" episodes, a series of moral and philosophical questions are raised. Who is the good guy and who is the bad guy here? From our perspective, the Federation is in the right and the Cardassians reveal their ruthlessness through torture and lies. But can the Federation be absolved of all wrongdoing? They crossed into Cardassian space and took covert action, clearly a violation of armistice rules.Is the Federation plagued with hypocrisy -- claiming to be a peaceful alliance but secretly breaking laws when it's convenient? (In the grand scheme, we notice that the Federation loves to add new members to their side, as long as they stop their traditional ways of life. The striving for hegemony and assimilation is as far-reaching as the Borg, but more discreet.) Keep that in mind when watching this one... our heroes are strong and have an admirable character. But is it possible that unintentionally they are advancing a sinister or divisive objective?",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Chain of Command: Part I (TV Episode 1992)","Great acting, interesting story - based on a pretty weak premise","Since everyone seems to have loved this two-parter, I'll play devil's advocate here and point out some of the things that didn't make sense. Summary: With tensions brewing on the Cardassian border, Picard, Crusher and Worf are sent into enemy territory to conduct a top secret mission. While they do their thing, the remaining Enterprise command-crew (under their new CO Cpt. Jellico) enter into negotiations with the Cardassians.Things I liked:The basic idea for the episode is top notch. Replacing Picard with an officer who is pretty much his polar opposite is very interesting. Ronny Cox does a great job of portraying the hard-ass Jellico. His questionable style of command and ""diplomacy"" put a great deal of stress on the crew (mostly on Riker) and this leads to some pretty tense confrontations - both in the negotiating-scenes and in his general interactions with the crew. Great performances: The scenes between Picard and his torturer (the excellent David Warner) are among the most realistic and disturbing in the entire series. Seeing a Picard who is (literally) stripped of everything and still (barely) stands his ground is enough to give you chills. Things I didn't like: The entire premise of the show, the things that set the story in motion and keep it going, all don't make sense. So they needed a small team of experts to infiltrate and investigate a hostile planet behind enemy lines, basically a Special-Ops type of mission ... and they turned to a middle-aged starship captain, a middle-aged doctor and a Klingon security chief? I can buy Worf going on the mission, but surely Starfleet must have some specialized group trained for these kinds of missions? Something along the lines of present day Navy SEALs/Delta Force/GSG9? Naturally, the reasons Picard gives for them having been chosen are laughable: He was picked because he's had experience with a certain type of carrier wave years and years ago. Worf is the muscle (fair enough) and Crusher is there because she knows how to use a tricorder, I guess.More importantly, Starfleet's handling of the entire situation make them seem rather incompetent.They decide to strip the Federation flagship of its CO - not a good idea if you send that ship into a tense situation that might very well lead to a battle or war. They then replace said CO with a guy whose style of leadership is sure to create a number of problems with the crew. This can't be a new personality trait of Jellico's so any higher ranking officer worth his salt should've foreseen the friction he creates on the Enterprise. And all this for no real reason - other than Jellico clearly wanting to establish himself as a hard-ass. There's no payoff to the changes Jellico makes, so they don't seem to have improved the Enterprise's effectiveness. Quite the opposite really, when Jellico first relieves Riker of duty and then has to basically beg the guy to fly a crucial mission. Jellico is there because he has extensive experience with the Cardassians - but all he really does in his negotiating scenes is insult the guys. Maybe that's the way to handle Cardassians, but then Troi confirms that Jellico isn't really as sure of himself as he's trying to appear. So he's clearly not the best man for the job - he basically comes across as pretty weak and incompetent. Again: Picard is a highly respected diplomat and someone who knows how to de-escalate a situation. He's not a special-forces operative.. so why use him in this capacity when he would be much more valuable at his usual post? Instead of using him, Starfleet sends in a ""diplomat"" who is sure to alienate the Cardassians every chance he gets. And these guys want to prevent war? Hmmm..Finally: The Cardassians' motivation doesn't make sense. They want Picard because they hope to gain information from him regarding the defense strategy for a system they want to invade/annex. They come up with this elaborate plan to lure Picard into a trap. A plan which requires extensive knowledge of Picard. But they didn't know he wouldn't be able to provide them with this information? And said information doesn't seem too important anyway. When they realize they can't get it from Picard, they still seem determined to attack anyway.. so why even go through this elaborate ruse to capture him? And I haven't even mentioned the fact that their entire plan hinges on Starfleet cooperating and sending in Picard to infiltrate the planet.All that said: I still like Chain of Command a lot. The acting is great, the basic ideas are good and the unusual situations the writers create are interesting to watch and give some new insights into the characters. I just wish they could've come up with a better reason for Picard getting replaced by Jellico and then getting captured and tortured. All in all: 7/10",7
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Chain of Command: Part I (TV Episode 1992)",Great acting,"As soon as I saw that David Warner was in the cast, I knew that there would be great acting based on a profound script in these episodes (parts I & II). Not that Warner did all of the good acting exuding malevolent gravitas with a touch of ironic and perverse bonhomie; it just seemed that his presence inspired the others to even better acting. Stewart as Picard was at his Shakespearean best. There was also the redoubtable Ronny Cox, whose acting talent has allowed us to suspend disbelief in so many movies. His portrayal of a harsh, by-the-book, unfeeling officer in command undoubtedly made audiences hate him at first. That is, until the end when his actions revealed that he cared for the welfare of Captain Picard after all. Although broadcast in 1992, I couldn't help but be struck by the immediate currency today (2011) of the moral, legal and psychological issues put forth in the story - torture sanctioned by government, the reliability of information obtained under torture, the psychology of the torturer and the tortured.In relating his experience under torture to Counselor Troi, Picard brought to light one of the effects of torture that had been in the peripheral vision of my mind but had never articulated: It is often said that the tortured would confess or reveal anything his handlers would like to hear just to stop his torment. But Picard shows that the victim himself would get to believe the lie that he is forced to confess. In other words, he would not be lying but telling the truth as he believes it as a form of psychological defense. In essence, therefore, brainwashing is a consequence of torture. And that is exactly, how some misguided authorities use it - to brainwash.So in the story, it became obvious, that the purpose of David Warner's character was not to get any kind of truth from Picard, but to brainwash him to get him to confess to some kind of Federation transgression of its treaty with the Cardassian Empire. In that way, the Cardassians may be able to intimidate the Federation into ceding territory to them.For more about brainwashing in movies, see John Frankenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate (1962) with Laurence Harvey in the anti-hero role and also the Ipcress File.",10
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Chain of Command: Part I (TV Episode 1992)",Gut Wrenching!,"The first of the two episodes sets things up. It begins with an admiral coming on board and taking the Enterprise away from Picard. He accepts this because there is a serious mission he, Beverly, and Worf are to go on to stop some activities by the Cardassians. Captain Jellico (Ronny Cox) takes over the ship and begins to change everything. He is a tyrant and doesn't care that the crew and especially Commander Riker find him repugnant. He is arbitrary and cruel. He never takes into account that Picard has commanded with honor the flagship of the fleet. Meanwhile, the three mates find themselves on the Cardassian planet, moving through a series of tunnels to find the object of their mission. They are finally ambushed. The Cardassians, who will become more important in other Trek offerings, especially Deep Space Nine, are a nasty bunch, full of hatred because of their war-like history. While negotiations go on on board with the hot headed Jellico leading them into dangerous territory, the away team is in for a nasty surprise. Well set up and captivating.",9
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Chain of Command: Part I (TV Episode 1992)",Pretty weak,"While I personally feel that TNG is the best of all of the Star Trek series, this is one of many episodes that they did that makes the whole series weaker. In my opinion this is an episode that was just poorly conceived, and the writers decided that people would be too stupid to tell how bad an idea it is.In summary: Captain Picard is relieved of command of the Enterprise in order to infiltrate a suspected Cardassian weapons laboratory. While he, Lt. Worf and Dr. Crusher are on this mission, he is captured by the Cardassians and subjected to prolonged torture in an attempt to get him to reveal sensitive information. This plan is foiled by the resolve of the Captain and he is sent back to the Enterprise having told the Cardassians nothing of importance apparently.While this is occurring a new officer is brought in to captain the Enterprise, a Captain Jellico, and the crew struggles to deal with the leadership style of this new captain.On the surface this seems like a plot that could be interesting. But when the writers decide that they need to have main characters do everything, the plot simply falls apart.While I have no doubt that virtually any government would see a weapons program like this as a danger that must be dealt with, I highly doubt that any government would choose to send the captain of the flagship to perform covert operations. Especially one as recognizable as Captain Picard, or to be blunt someone as old as Picard.The writers come up with a flimsy rationale for this, Captain Picard apparently has more experience with Theta waves than any other currently serving captain in the federation. One massive problem with this excuse is that the weapon is not Theta waves, they are only the supposed delivery vector. Another massive flaw with this is that while Picard is the most knowledgeable captain on this subject, there surely must be other people in the federation with similar or superior knowledge of the subject, that are not captains, are not pushing 60, and could not jeopardize entire fleet movements and Federation strategy.If you need to send someone on a secret mission, you would not send someone that nearly everyone on the enemy's side could immediately recognize. And you especially would not send a person that has information stored in their head that could threaten the entire federation. That is just stupid. You would send trained but expendable members of the military (e.g. Army Rangers), or members a covert organization (e.g. CIA) to do the dirty work because that is what those people do. Someone like Picard should then receive the information and review it due to his apparent expertise, not be sent out to play James Bond.As for Jellico and the Enterprise, it actually seems like a subplot. To then have that subplot essentially go nowhere is not only frustrating, it makes one feel like an entire episode has been wasted when the main plot is that flimsy. All the Enterprise and it's crew did during the entire two part episode is run around following the seeming whims of a power hungry egomaniac (such as changing duty schedules from three shifts a day to four for no apparent purpose, since he makes everyone in engineering work for 48 hours straight anyway), and complain. They could have left the Enterprise at a space station for all the good it did for the story and delivered mines onto the enemy craft using a shuttle, which they did anyway.To be fair the acting was well done. Both Jellico and Gul Lemec are loathsome characters that you could see actually existing somewhere, and Patrick Stewart does some fine acting while he is being ""tortured"". You can feel the anguish with him in several scenes. But good acting cannot make up for a plot that essentially makes no sense.If they had sent Picard and the Enterprise onto the scene after the secret mission to help deal with the ramifications of running covert operations in territory controlled by a treaty partner, this could have been a very good episode. As it is though this two part episode feels very forced and unbelievable, and is one episode I will not make the mistake of watching again.",3
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Chain of Command: Part I (TV Episode 1992)",Suspension of disbelief is beyond the norm,"Let's see...

The Federation of a thousand planets can't put together an actual commando force? Then we have assigning a new Captain to the Enterprise while Picard is away on his raid, despite having a first officer who is well-trained, experienced and has demonstrated numerous times his ability to handle the Enterprise.

It has a military force in the tens of thousands perhaps even quadrant wide a few million. Maybe more. Yo can call yourselves peaceful all you want but lets be honest, you cannot expect us to believe there are no problems, no nutjobs like whatisname in Star Trek 5 (worst movie of the Star Trek franchise).No planets at the edges with dictator wannabes, No skirmishes where the Federation has to send in special teams or even troops to quell the problem. Or even assassination squads.So we are supposed to believe that the Federation has absolutely NO DELTA FORCE/SEAL TEAMS type of people who know how to infiltrate and destroy potential weaponry. Or capture certain people and exfil or assassinate them?Or Changelings ala ODO of STDS9?No they have to have a medical officer who is absolutely WORTHLESS except as a doctor to be an undercover spy/explosives expert and a Klingon, Worf who make sense as he would be good in a fight but he has little self control especially in a very dangerous and secret operation.And this idiocy of bringing in an admiral with no experience on the Enterprise and especially a strange ship in battle (to him) and taking over from Picard? No, made no sense. Riker had handled the ship before.(Off topic sort of What would have been kind of cool if if they had taken us on a tour of the entire ship. ALL of it)I lost interest in the episode(s) when they first came out to the point where I started playing solitaire on my computer while watching and just looked up to see the various things that happened.I realize they all use the ""budget constraints"" nonsense but that is the problem, they don't really have them that badly. They had already sold the rights for .

Even though the mission is eventually justified, I've always thought these were unlikely candidates for a stealth job. What it really does is sideline the captain of the Enterprise for an abrasive replacement (Ronny Cox), someone who runs counter to everything that makes the ship run smoothly (almost an affirmation of the writers' need to shake things up on an long-running show), and that just makes for good drama; we want this guy to take a hike and get the ship back on a smooth course.But this episode exists almost purely as setup for Part II, and to that end, the best scene is saved for last.

12,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Chain of Command: Part I (TV Episode 1992)",A new captain for the Enterprise,"As this, the first part of a two-part story, opens Capt. Picard is relieved of his command and replaced by Capt. Jellico; a man with a very different attitude to command. Jellico has been given the position because it looks as if the fragile peace with the Cardassians is about to break down and he has experience of dealing with them. Before he can even think about dealing with the Cardassians he must mould the Enterprise's crew into the crew he wants; something that might be tricky given their loyalty to Picard and his way. Meanwhile Picard, Worf and Dr Crusher are preparing for a secret mission that will take them into Cardassian territory to investigate the possible development of an illegal biological weapon.This episode is very much setting things up for a more dramatic second part but that doesn't mean it isn't an exciting episode; far from it. The end scenes where Picard and his team enter the Cardassian facility is definitely exciting. The make up of the away team is a little surprising at first but it is explained that Picard's prior experience on the USS Stargazer makes him essential and Beverly's medical knowledge makes her the logical choice to identify any biological weapons. Patrick Stewart showed that he could play a believable action-man and it was nice to see Gates McFadden's character, Dr Crusher, out of sickbay in a proper action situation. The events on the Enterprise are no less interesting; Ronny Cox's Capt. Jellico certainly contrasted with Picard; he is essentially a military man rather than an explorer. His style quickly rubs the crew up the wrong way leading to some interesting scenes and even one noticeable change Counsellor Troi is told to wear a standard uniform rather than her usual costume... to my mind an improvement! As the episode comes to a close the tension is high and Picard is captured I can't wait to see how the story concludes.",9

Cruel,gripping, sadistic, well written, real are all descriptors that come to mind. Warner always brings something special to every role he takes on, but the scenes with he and Stewart are some of the finest tit for tat toe to toe, between oppressor and the tortured that I have ever seen. It is hard to believe that he only had three days to prepare for his role as he plays the interrogator with such steel one assumes that he must have had months to get in character. Many episodes don't really give Stewart the fullness of range a character actor such as he needs, but this one wholly does. Having Warner as his foil, a reason to rise above the norm, Stewart continually being asked how many lights he sees, brought a tear to my eye.

The fact that the writers made Jellico an antagonist, not a villain, was a masterstroke. The weaknesses of the Enterprise crew were revealed, and it was great to see all those energies crossfire.Although Jellico may seem unlikable at first, I have to say his approach is correct. The crew was all whiny and pretty unprofessional. In war time, people usually die, and they will die for sure if they are unprepared. That was the Captain's responsibility and he had to take measures. So complaining about hard work and the lack of ""rest & relaxation"" in such times is unacceptable for a military-trained crew.(Yes, Star Fleet is a military organization, even if its main goal is exploration).Jellico is a very interesting, multi-dimensional character, and it would have been extraordinary to see more of him in later episodes.

A re-visit to these episodes reveal major flaws in the story. First, why is Captain Jellicoe negotiating with anyone? His job is to prepare for the possibility of war with the Cardassians. Second, why send Picard, a high ranking commanding officer, on an extremely risky spy mission? Third, how could the Federation let itself be so thoroughly duped by the Cardassians? Fourth, why was Ryker so upset? He had no cause to be upset. He repeatedly disobeys orders and generally behaves obnoxiously. Fifth, in this story the Federation does not occupy high moral ground. Further, the Federation is revealed to have major flaws. It makes strategic decisions on faulty information,its attitude is belligerent, both Starship captains have major issues - Jellicoe negotiates in bad-faith, Picard is a spy, and members of the crew are willful and obstinate. Why Ryker is not brought up on charges is a mystery.Wow, what a strong episode. Ryker reveals himself as being a real twerp. A new captain comes on board and Ryker immediately cops an attitude. He reacts like a child. He doesn't like taking orders. He is inflexible and selfish. Instead of trying to help the new captain, Jellicoe, Ryker pouts and sulks. All this while Jellicoe has to negotiate with a belligerent alien race that is openly hostile and threatening to invade a planet. The rest of the crew isn't any better. They are serving on a warship, yet are openly annoyed and distressed at Jellicoe who wants to prepare for the possibility of war. The only way to get the aliens to back down is to show them that the Federation will not budge. Instead, Jellicoe is getting no support from the crew, which makes it even harder for him to deal with his adversary, and which puts the ship at risk. For a television sci-fi series, the dialog is excellent, and the story intense. That is surprising.",9
17,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Chain of Command: Part I (TV Episode 1992)",avoiding risks..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily.

The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 06This sixth somehow seems to have hold down the train of enthralling compartments, the concepts are still fresh and comes in with new perspective but unfortunately the storytelling isn't as engaging as the previous seasons.Chain Of Command Part IThis episode definitely connects the most with its audience since it dwells upon the most common incident of one's lifestyle that is to go through the politics of working under a government or a boss or in an office.",

To see a rehash of the old ""anti-appeasement"" argument. One year after the Gulf War with all its sinister lead-up, three years after the fall of the USSR and the 'triumph' of MAD and Cold War containment, nine years before endless war, we get a homage to the Duke Wayne brand of human nature: war is too important to be left to diplomats."" The militaristic, 'just follow orders,' no negotiations style is what secures the niceties of a democratic, open society (starship). Such BS. Might Paul Wolfowitz be the co-writer. My enjoyment of this series has almost been negated. Oh yes, that dime-store psychology of the 8 year old being bullied turning to torture as a career does NO justice to the horrors victims of torture endure, especially when carried out by a country cloaking themselves as protectors of freedom and civility - as happened in our endless wars.

While the regular cast was good, the performance by Ronny Cox and particularly David Warner were terrific. Warner's performance was superb as Gul Madred as he held and tortured Picard, most of it psychologically and emotionally. Two scenes were especially good, one with Gul Madred's daughter and the other with the starving Picard eating a raw Cardisian dish. Cox, playing Captain Jellico, gave a very solid performance as the arrogant captain who replaced Picard. The confrontations between Cox and Frakes were almost as compelling as the interaction between Warner and Stewart. Definitely one of the best performances for acting of all TNG episodes.",10
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Chain of Command: Part II (TV Episode 1992)",Unusual Integrity,"Torture is a common plot device in American media. It is powerfully provocative. But while most media portray torture, falsely, as effective and fast though messy, TNG portrayts it truthfully as unreliable and spoiling of potential intelligence as well as a horrible crime.Besides the incredible integrity shown in this episode so characteristic of the Star Trek franchise, and TNG especially, this episode contains superb acting and writing. The primary characters all appear to have depth and aren't easily distinguished as the ""evil enemy"" and the ""great hero"". It really goes to show that expensive production costs are not required for great dramatic performance.",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Chain of Command: Part II (TV Episode 1992)","He's shown 4 lights in front of him and asked, ""How many lights are there""? When Picard says ""4"" he's subjected to extreme pain.","In 'Chain of Command' Captain Picard (who knows Starfleet's battle plans for this sector of space), is captured by the Cardassians who are planning a surprise attack.The entire episode consists of Picard being tortured by Cardassians. He's shown 4 lights in front of him and asked, ""How many lights are there""? When Picard says ""4"" he's subjected to extreme pain. He's told, ""you see 5 lights Captain, tell us how many you see"". There are 4 lights, and Picard continues to tell him there are 4.Other reviewers have said this is a scene taken from the story '1984' by George Orwell. Perhaps to highlight or explain the 'Orwellian' idea in the book, of being told one thing, while reality is something else. I did not notice this connection myself watching the episode, having never read '1984'.Apparently, for the Cardassians, getting him to admit to something he knows is not true, even something as meaningless as this, is the first step in his brainwashing. They never ask Picard about battle plans, Starship numbers, or anything, but the number of lights. He's continuously subjected to extreme pain but even after extreme torture they can never get Picard to say he sees 5 lights. This is a terrible episode for the character of Picard, ranking up there with the one where Picard is assimilated by the Borg against his will.After being rescued from the ordeal, Picard is counseled by Deanna Troi back aboard the Enterprise. He says, ""You know, near the end. I could see 5 lights"". Obviously with the torture he could 'see' 5 lights, something that wasn't even there (a powerful statement on it's own), but he continued to tell his captors he only saw 4.The episode is done in such a way that the end is really an awakening of sorts, and potentially a beginning. There was never any doubt in my (overconfident) mind that they intended to make some kind of statement at the end. I've only seen the episode once, but I knew that what I felt at the end was not a figment of my imagination or something subjective or personal. When the show ends; when Picard says those last lines to Deanna Troi, about being alone on the prison planet, he's looking almost directly into the camera and not at Deanna, ""Near the end. I could see five lights"". When he says those last lines at the end... we know he's talking to us.",9
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Chain of Command: Part II (TV Episode 1992)",Based on Orwell's 1984,"This episode sees Captain Picard trapped by the Cardassians and the dreaded Gul Madred, played with chilling poise by David Warner. Picard is being interrogated by Madred and, as in the book 1984 by George Orwell, is asked, ""how many lights are there?"" Picard answers that there are four and the Cardassian devil continues to torture him until Picard says otherwise. All the while, Picard has been free to go, and never once there is anything but four lights. It is truly a demonstration of how much Picard is made of. He withstands the insults, the torture, and the hatred--but there are still four lights. There has never been a greater demonstration of what makes a captain and why they are ensured the care of all under their command.",

It begins with Captain Picard in custody after a screwed up mission falls apart. Now the Cardassians are going to torture him to try to get him to betray secrets. At the same time, the Enterprise's new captain, Jellico (Ronnie Cox), is trying to somehow take a total screw-up and turn it into a Federation victory...something which seems impossible.This is a gritty episode and much of it consists of Picard stripped naked and being tortured. There is some nudity but it isn't gratuitous and the show is very compelling--and occasionally tough to watch.",9
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Chain of Command: Part II (TV Episode 1992)",There Are Four Lights!,"In the conclusion of this episode, we are toggled between the Enterprise and the imprisoned Picard, kept by Cardassian torturers on the surface. Picard is first drugged and then stripped and subjected to horrors. I came to realize that this was not unlike Winston Smith in Orwell's 1984. The Cardassian commander is seeking information from Picard and he uses every bit of subterfuge he can, including a torture device implanted in the Captain which sends him into agony. He continually asks Picard how many lights are above him. There are four and Picard continues to affirm this. But the commander wants him to change his mind (true brainwashing). Patrick Stewart gives the performance of a lifetime (and he has been good in lots of performances). Meanwhile, the crew is trying to figure out how to outfox the evil Cardassians. Picard begins to sense little bits of weakness in the commander and his race and plays on that. While it just results in more pain, he is making inroads into his psyche. The conclusion is excellent and sets up future encounters. There is also a great scene between Commander Riker and Captain Jellico.",10
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Chain of Command: Part II (TV Episode 1992)","And now, the (superb) conclusion","Now this is exactly the reason people remember ""Chain of Command""; the superior second part. And right from minute one, it's hard to watch because of the subject matter: Captain Picard being tortured by a Cardassian officer (David Warner) while Jellico (Ronny Cox) is gumming up the works on the Enterprise. But it's not the physical abuse that's so effective here, rather the psychological results. It's miserable to see Picard's systematic dehumanization and just as hard to see him in such a weakened state. It's the acting here that really sells this' Warner offers up one of the great TNG villains in a performance that varies from affectionate to sheer menace. And Stewart is his equal, no question. Even Ronny Cox turns the one-note Jellico into someone interesting.I've seen this before (several times) and it never once fails to suck me right in. It's cold, vicious and undeniably powerful.10/10",10
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Chain of Command: Part II (TV Episode 1992)",A superlative episode of TNG,"Following on from the events of the previous episode Capt. Picard is in the custody of Cardassian interrogator Gul Madred. Madred starts asking him questions. At first he asks about Federation defences but then he turns on four lights above his head and asks Picard how many there are and when he replies 'four' he is corrected he expects the answer 'Five'. That is just the start; stripped, physically tortured by a 'pain implant' and exhausted he continues be questioned. Back on the Enterprise the Cardassians claim to have captured Picard but his actions are disavowed leaving him with no legal protection. Riker confronts Capt. Jellico, suggesting that a rescue mission be planned, their discussion gets heated and Riker is relieved of duty. That doesn't mean that nothing will be done though; Jellico orders Geordi to scan the Cardassian ship for any hint of where it has been; there are signs that it has been in a nearby nebula the perfect place for an attack fleet to hide. Jellico orders the deployment of mines in the nebula; something sure to get the Cardassians attention.This is a great conclusion to this two part story. The scenes between Patrick Stewart and David Warner as Picard and Madred are top notch with some of the most disturbing scenes of the series possibly even more disturbing now than when the episode was made as the way a naked Picard is suspended is very reminiscent of the infamous photographs of a prisoner in the notorious Abu Ghraib prison. These scenes are effective because the way Madred is portrayed as a man going about his work; calmly and professionally rather than as a ranting psychopath. Another fine guest performance comes from Ronny Cox who plays the somewhat ambiguous Jellico; it is hard to tell if he is a martinet or merely somebody with different ways but who is still a good officer who gets results. The outcome of the episode won't come as much of a surprise as we all know Picard will ultimately be okay but there is a chilling epilogue where he talks to Counsellor Troi and tells her that not only was he ready to say he saw five lights but more disturbingly that he believed he was seeing that many. Overall one of the best episodes in the series.",10

11,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Chain of Command: Part II (TV Episode 1992)",Excellent Performance by Sir Patrick Stewart,"There are several episodes that I love and look for to watch over and over. There are very few that I skip over when streaming. These 2 episodes are the rare times when I have to be in the mood to watch. Patrick Stewarts performance is very moving. Some of his best acting on any of his shows. Hes completely believable as the willing captive (willing only due to his inability to allow his crew to be in his position). He shows how our psyche is so stong while at the same time so fragile. This part of the storyline is what draws me back to watch.Up to this point, every time Picard has been indisposed, the Enterprise has been turned over to Riker. He has always been the best choice since he knows the crew and day-to-day ops better than anyone else. He has also been in command during fights with the Borg. It greatly annoys me that they turn command over to Captain Jellico for no good reason. This completely upsets the crew and could potentionally cause Picard distraction from his mission which is why the Federation removes him from command in the first place (to allow him to have complete focus on his mission). The Federation leaves Picard with no reason to think he will get his ship returned to him. It throws the whole crew off to the point they can no longer be effective in their very critical jobs.The writers seem to do this just to cause chaos, let the veiwer believe Picard will never return, and that the crew will split up. It was a cheap way of causing controversy which could have been done in other ways. Since this situation encompasses both episodes, when I watch, I tend to only watch the 2nd episode. At least that way I get to watch Stewarts incredible performance and see Riker take Jellico down a few pegs. If it werent for Picards situation, it would be my least favorite pair of episodes and I would never watch them again.",10

Well, anyways, this is one of the most gripping episodes. This really sets up the Cardassians for DS9, as this is the episode before DS9 started. The torture scenes with Picard was really deep, with Picard being told there were five lights instead of four, and if he said four he is subjected to pain. The other half of the episode was with Jellico and the Enterprise. You can tell the different style with how Jellico leads opposed to Captain Picard, with Jellico wanting everything to be done. The dropping mines with a shuttlecraft bit was pretty neat, and it shows how the Cardassians withdrew from the nebula, which also explains the start of DS9, too. One of the classic episodes, and always fun to rewatch.",9
13,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Chain of Command: Part II (TV Episode 1992)","Excellent episode, with certain caveats","As drama, this episode of Star Trek approaches a level of excellence that is rarely even remotely achieved in a television series. It is apparent that the producers of this show actually made the effort to produce something that was worthy of the term drama. Npw, the problem with this episode is that it does not further develop the Jellico-Riker conflict, which revealed a lot about Commander Riker. Coddled by Captain Picard, Riker reveals a nastier side of his personality when placed under the supervision of another captain who wants results, fast, and has no time or interest in trying to elicit cooperation. Riker's fundamental failings are revealed when he has to be relieved of his duties, for cause, rendering himself useless and sabotaging the captain's efforts to prepare the ship for possible war. Captain Jellico did nothing to warrant Riker's antagonism. Riker was argumentative, surly, resistant to supervision, and failed to discharge his duties, proving that he was not fit for higher command. As for Captain Picard, he is tortured by an alien who is trying to extract information. Here, Picard's moral position is not completely tenable. First, he was captured after having infiltrated an alien space ship while negotiations were in progress; a hostile act. Second, it was the Federation that was acting aggressively, not the the aliens, thus, Picard could not claim the moral high ground. Also, the alien is not a human and therefore may have a completely different set of values governing his conduct. Nevertheless, this episode deserves praise for its attempt to examine a number of questions relating to personal conduct and integrity and as such is worth watching.",

And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt.

If the professor and his love, the Countess Barthalomew, are not allowed to leave the ship on their own, he will destroy the Enterprise and its crew.This episode doesn't stand out as one of the most memorable in the series, but it's still a fine episode in its own right. And why shouldn't it be, featuring Dwight Schultz as Barclay, easily my favorite recurring secondary character. And Moriarty is a respectable character. (The Countess Barthalomew, unfortunately, comes off as being very poorly written. She is very dense, comparing outer space to Africa and talking about the joy of wearing trousers. I can't imagine an educated woman would be this daft.) Philosophy professors could sit back and play ""Next Generation"" episodes for semester after semester with a little commentary to fill in the history. This episode is very scientific (including discussion of ""uncoupling the Heisenberg compensators"" on the transporter, whatever the heck that means). Underneath all that, it's simply a fleshing out of Descartes' ""Cogito Ergo Sum"" doubting method. (Moriarty actually quotes Descartes in the episode.) Descartes asked, how can we know what is around us is real and not simply in our mind? Future philosophers modified this to the ""brain in a vat"" hypothesis -- given constant stimuli, would a brain know it wasn't in a body if the input told it that it was? Here we have Enterprise crew who may be on the Enterprise or may simply be in the holodeck. How can they tell if what they see is real or is simply fed to their senses? Just as philosophers determined that we likely cannot tell, so, too, does the crew find that reality and simulated reality are virtually the same.I watched this episode at around three in the morning after drinking some whiskey. It really made my brain work extra hard, which is something that isn't safe if you're not used to exercising it. But that's what really sells this episode -- the deeper message under the basic plot.

It wasn't too obvious although it might have been if I'd paid more attention to the episode title! The idea of having holodecks within holodecks was rather fun; reminding me of 'Inception' although here we aren't told what is happening in advance. It was nice to see Dwight Schultz return as Barclay especially as this episode wasn't centred on one of his various problems.

I can't help but wonder exactly how the holodeck works, specifically, how are three separate locations with changing perspectives convincingly generated within a single room. Stay with me here folks: when Data is in the holographic transporter room, Barclay is in the holographic holodeck, and Picard is off screen what exactly are the holo emitters doing? Seems impossible but the next episode is already playing. Looks like a murder mystery.",7

The following below is nothing.Diagnosing anomalies in the recreative Sherlock Holmes hologram game programs, Lieutenant Reginald 'Reg' Barclay III discovers protected memory contains the arch-villain character professor James Moriarty, who has become self-conscious and demands fulfillment of a recent promise by the crew that they would think up a way for him to leave the holodeck . To Picard's astonishment, Moriarty proves empirically his will suffices to leave the Holodeck, he even retains a physical body. Picard grants him the benefit of the doubt despite his crimes in fiction, but refuses to grant life to the countess Barthalomew, who was created as his ideal but holographic mate. Moriarty manages to seize control of the Enterprise to force the crew to obey anyhow at pain of total destruction. That still leaves the technological challenge, but Data's logical deduction comes up with an entirely different viewpoint, inspiring another challenge and approach",8

But for me, I really hate most of the holodeck episodes and find the plots in them are pretty silly and forgettable. Early in the series, I thought a particularly weak holo episode was the one where Data played Sherlock Holmes. So, I wasn't really happy to see yet another Holmes show and despite an overall score of 8.5 at this time, I cannot agree to the high scores for this one in particular.The show begins with Data and Geordi playing a Sherlock Holmes case. However, strange errors occur and they ask Barkley to look into the problem. Soon, Moriarty appears and announces to Barkley that he's mad that Picard has kept him stuck in the computer even though he'd promised in the previous episode to try to help him obtain sentience and life outside the holodeck. And, when Picard is once again unable to come up with a solution to help Moriarty, the arch-villain responds by once again taking over the ship.The 19th century fictional character Moriarty comes alive in the 24th century and wants to become a real person. Doesn't that also seem pretty contrived to you?! The bottom line is that this one is stuck aboard the Enterprise and just seemed very weak and silly.",3

I appreciate their candor--and agree that it's a pretty awful episode--mostly because of how Geordi is portrayed in this very creepy show.Geordi is part of a team investigating what happened at a remote relay station. The two people who SHOULD be there aren't. One appears to be a pile of goo and they have no idea what's become of the other. To get a better idea, Geordi looks through Lt. Uhnari's personal logs, though conveniently (and with no real explanation) parts of the files are missing. The logs are often very personal and LaForge takes WAY too much delight into listening to this missing woman's thoughts. It's very much reminiscent of how he pathetically fell for his holo version of Dr. Leah Brahms and once again Geordi LaForge is just plain pathetic and creepy. It gets worse, however, once they locate the Lieutenant, as LaForge does NOT behave professionally but more like a lovesick teen. Because of the unprofessional and creepy way LaForge behaves throughout the show, it's clearly a bad episode. Now the solution to the killing and disappearance does seem kind of interesting, though the 'creature' looks more like a gigantic turd...and that made me laugh. Overall, a pretty terrible outing.",2

2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Aquiel (TV Episode 1993)",Hitchcock murder mystery,This is a well written and original TNG episode. Don't understand why it receives low rating on IMDb but it rings of Hithcock's TV show. A must see episode for Trekkies and Hitchcock fans. The plot is thick and it leaves the viewer guessing right up until the end. The suspense is masterfully shot by the director. It is an all around winner.Also its nice to see Klingon's written into an episode that isn't about the empire or war. I think if people look at this episode in that light then it is a justifiable 8 out of 10. It definitely does not deserve the 5.9 it has received so far.,8
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Aquiel (TV Episode 1993)",The One Where Geordi Facebook Stalks a Girl and Ends Up Battling 'The Thing',"The premise is an intriguing one, as The Enterprise arrives to resupply a sub-space relay station only to find what is possibly the remains of one of the two crew members, a shuttlecraft missing, and the only other living being left alive: a dog.Before the teaser even ended my pop culture reference radar went off, as this was surely throwing a reference to 1982's 'The Thing'. What followed was red herring after red herring, as Geordi scoured through the station's computer to recover Lt. Aquiel Uhnari's personal logs and began connecting a Klingon patrol to the apparent death of at least one of the relay station's occupants. It's a creepy sight as Geordi begins to fall in love with a girl who is presumed dead, whilst snooping through her things and petting her dog. It's a common thread that I've come across with rewatching ST:TNG - that Geordi's relationships never play out as straight forward, and he often comes across as being a sexual predator at the worst, a creep who doesn't know how to be professional with women at best. Whether any of this is by accident is debatable, but it is certainly a testament to poor writing. Ronald D. Moore has gone on record as saying he wish he had not written ""Aquiel"", and I don't blame him. Perhaps it's the burden of filling a 26 episode season that results in misfires for even the greatest of television shows, and maybe that can be forgiven. But this episode is a referential mess with a hint of stalker-y gratification for one of the main supporting characters, and deserves all the unforgiving criticism it gets.",4

Geordi who seems to fall in love with spectres or hologram images, once again falls for a woman who may well be dead (this happens when he explore her video logs). She appears to be a high strung, whiney woman, but she is attractive. Geordi's loneliness and failure with women is well documented and here, again, he puts his heart on his sleeve. Later this woman is found by the Klingons (who were initially blamed) flying on a space shuttle. She takes refuge on the Enterprise and starts an affair with Geordi. Because she has been caught in lies, it is natural that she be put under observation. LaForge is there for her, of course. Sometimes he can be such a little boy. It isn't that he is wrong but that he becomes a loose cannon, fortunate not to completely upset the apple cart. I just couldn't get into this episode.",6
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Aquiel (TV Episode 1993)",Star Trek The Next Generation--Aquiel,"While I won't sit here and take a giant dump on ""Aquiel"", even a Trekkie like me considers this episode not of the usual solid standard of the writing that often occurred during the successful run of Star Trek: The Next Generation. It is a bit too convoluted in its mystery (although, fans of mysteries might consider this a good thing), and the ""coalescent being"" that has to absorb others in order to survive is a big stink of unimpressive. I do, however, admit that I enjoyed the opening part of the episode prior to Aquiel's emergence alive and well; the way Geordi once again falls hard for the Aquiel during her visual/audio communications to her sister, trying to find something that might explain what happened on the relay station so near the Klingon space. A mass of unidentifiable cellular structure fused into a metal floor from high-level phaser fire is cut and analyzed by Dr. Crusher in Sick Bay on the Enterprise. Meanwhile, a Klingon is mentioned in voice logs by Aquiel, and his DNA is located on the relay station. A monitor with missing logs links to this Klingon. A monster that transforms into whatever it absorbs, trying to mimic a possible human, whether it is Aquiel or the Klingon, could place anyone on the Enterprise (particularly Geordi) in danger of being absorbed. Oh, Aquiel has a pet dog, too, that seemingly bonds with Geordi. This pooch might not be man's best friend as so perceived. I didn't think that Renée Jones was as poor (as Aquiel) as the sentiment from this episode's detractors seem to feel, but when you get an episode named after you, there's high expectations to deliver. I actually liked how the Klingons were used as minor plot devices (instead of being involved in major far-reaching angles all the time; sometimes, Klingons become involved in minor Federation affairs), even though there's plenty of reason to suggest that the alliance between them and the Federation is quite shaky and less-than-kosher. Wayne Grace is a hoot as a very disgruntled, ornery Klingon, Governor Torak, not liking it at all that one of his officers might be accused of something criminal on board a Federation station. Toeing the line, Torak, under much angst, does force the criminal Klingon to face the music. The tension between Commander Riker and Geordi was quite fun to watch considering they have such fondness for each other, and all over a woman. Riker concerned for Geordi's welfare and emotional health, doesn't wish for him to get personally involved with Aquiel, if just because she could be responsible for murder. She claims, though, that it was self defense and that ""lost time"" cannot be explained (her time after the initial attack from her fellow officer on the relay station and her escape into the shuttlecraft, later found in Klingon space). It was as if her ""memories were drained from her"". The scene where Crusher's hand forms when a plate of the coalescent goo touches her briefly in a reckless attempt of absorption is rather bizarre (it was perhaps a bit of a forced revelation so that the mystery regarding the absorbing lifeform could be explained and discovered). A long series is bound to have black sheep, and ""Aquiel"" has been treated to the doormat by The Next Gen's fans (and those who made the episode especially recognized it as a failure). I wouldn't call it an episode without plenty of flaws and problems, but I've seen worse. Just watch Shades of Grey in comparison.",5
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Aquiel (TV Episode 1993)",The Plot Makes No Sense,"This episode is a mystery story, and I cannot dissect it without revealing the key revelations, so do not read any further if you have not seen the episode and are intending to.So I just saw this episode for the very first time; somehow I had managed to miss it for all these years. It's pretty bad.Someone else here did a nice job discussing many aspects of its badness, so I will not repeat them. I will instead focus on the problems with the plot, which I have not seen discussed. I find at least three plot flaws.The least important of these involves the Klingon who boarded the station. While I actually *liked* the use of Klingons in this story as a red herring, the Klingon's actions don't really make sense. He comes on this station, finds no one around, and then, randomly takes a bunch of communications that are one of the worst macguffin's I've ever encountered: *no* mention of what they were or why they were important or what *possible* use he could have had for them. He's a Klingon, after all, not a Romulan or a Cardassian, he's unlikely to be interested in espionage. It's hard to imagine what could possibly be in the communications that could interest him. But OK, we'll suspend disbelief on this and assume there's some plausible explanation that the lazy writing couldn't be bothered to tell us about (or perhaps the broadcast I just watched cut the relevant scene). But here's the unacceptably stupid part: these are computer records, logs of data passing through this communications station. So if you ""take"" them, they're not *gone*, you just took a copy. For the records to be *missing*, the Klingon would have had to both steal a copy *and* then go and delete the originals. He's have to *go out of his way to leave evidence of trespass*. HUH????But OK, the whole Klingon thing was a red herring anyway, and not essential to the main plot. So let's review said plot; with the benefit of hindsight, let's put together a time-line of what is actually supposed to have happened:o On some remote assignment, Lt. Unpleasant-Guy gets eaten and replaced by this funky shape-shifting take-the-form-of-the-thing-you-just-ate entity. OK.o The changeling Lt. Unpleasant-Guy gets transfered to the communication station with Lt. Geordi-Love-Interest. After a couple days, the changeling thing needs to eat someone else, so he attacks her. She manages to get to the weapons locker, grab a phaser, set it to 10, and escape in a shuttlecraft, albeit losing some memories in the process. OK.o The changeling Lt. U-G, having no other alternatives, eats and turns into the dog. Then, the changeling dog-- get this-- for some reason manages to climb into that little access tunnel and somehow manages to pull that big heavy piece of equipment behind him to block the entrance to the tunnel. Neither the ""how"" nor the ""why"" of this makes the tiniest bit of sense.o The Klingon guy shows up and does his preposterous steal-the-records-AND-destroy- them trick.o The Enterprise guys show up and find this residue stuck to the floor that used to be someone. Later, it turns into Dr. Crusher's hand in order to prove it's this shape-shifting- and-replacing entity. BIG PROBLEM: Who the hell is *that*?!?!? It's *not* Lt. U-G's changeling, that became the dog! So just who's remains did the Enterprise guys find? And what happened to it? Geordi has already asserted that even the set-on-10 phaser couldn't have done that, unless it was fired for like 30 seconds, which would not be self-defense. Nobody argued that point. Lt. G-L-I's only possible motive here would be self-defense; it's established that she was being attacked (her memory draining), and she fled in the shuttlecraft. There would have been no need to flee if she had stood there for 30 seconds annihilating-- who? Remind me again who that was supposed to be? Again, the shape-shifter guy wasn't annihilated, he became the dog.When someone can give me a plausible explanation of who the remains were and how they got that way, I'll give this episode a higher rating.",2

Further investigation reveals that one of the crew was killed by a phaser burst that reduced the victim to a small residue on the deck plating and the station's shuttle is missing. Clearly we have a mystery to be solved who killed whom and why? Geordi sets about investigating the personal logs of the crew; there are none from one of them but crew member Lt. Aquiel Uhnari left several; mostly in communications to her sister. Her correspondence reveals that she did not get on with her colleague, who had arrived a mere five days previously and a local Klingon commander had been harassing the station. It looks like one of these two must have killed her and the Klingon is brought on board for questioning then there is a real surprise; the shuttle turns up with one passenger aboard; Lt. Aquiel Uhnari! Having spent hours going through her personal correspondence Geordi feels like he knows her but while he becomes friends with her others feel she could be the killer.This is a decent enough episode with a nice mystery at its centre; while I'm sure some people will guess the identity of the real killer that would probably because they wonder why that character is there not because of any obvious evidence. In a previous episode Geordi came off as a bit creepy when it comes to romance and there are hints of that here although in this case he tells Aquiel straight out that he feels like he knows her because his investigation necessitated the watching of her personal files. The final answer to the mystery is a little disappointing as it involves major elements that couldn't reasonably be worked out until we see the results of Dr Crusher's tests late in the episode. Another weakness is the appearance of the alien killer in the final scene; the CGI blob is worse than just about any 'man in a rubber suit' monster.

It's a different character, perhaps to avoid paying royalties.We perhaps learn more about the Romulans in this episode more than in any other.",

On board the Enterprise a Federation defector to Romulus returns home setting in motion the events that will bring the two ships together. The stakes are high as both the defector and the Romulan that roped Troi into the plot are working for ambassador Spock and his dissident movement, a plot thread set up in Unification parts 1 & 2. The part of the Romulan Commander is very well played as is the Federation defector. Marina Sirtis knocks it out of the park as well. Rewatchable.Gaping plot hole: Troi doesn't speak Romulan.

She soon learns, from Romulan officer Sub-commander N'Vek that she is in no danger if she does as he advises. She is to play the role of Major Rakal, a member of the dreaded Tal Shiar secret police, to order ship's captain, Commander Toreth, to take a secret cargo to a rendezvous point where it can be transferred to a cargo vessel before it is taken to the Federation. It turns out N'Vek is working with the opposition and this is all part of Ambassador Spock's plan to establish an escape route for progressive Romulans. It soon becomes apparent that Toreth despises the Tal Shiar but she also fears them so does as 'Rakal' orders her. Meanwhile a disaffected Federation defector who had been living on Romulus returns and tells Capt. Picard that he is working for Spock and that he should head to the Kaleb sector.This is a top notch episode that sees Counsellor Troi taking centre stage; it was great seeing this rather touchy-feely character being forced to show a bit of steel. Marina Sirtis does a great job making us believe that Troi can pull off the deception. The scenes between her and Carolyn Seymour's Commander Toreth were really good and shone a light on the relationship between the Romulan military and the Tal Shiar. This episode also illustrated that the Romulans aren't as a whole keen for battle and do care about others they are just a little paranoid! Troi's situation keeps the tension high throughout as any slip up could lead to her exposure and execution. There are also moments of excitement when Troi realises that the captain of the freighter can't be trusted then, in the final scenes, where the Romulans contemplate destroying the Enterprise! Overall this all adds up to a top notch episode.",9

But I have good reasons for rating it a 10.reason one: Dialog in Q episodes are usually witty and sharp, this is no exception. When I say sharp, I mean in the face sharp. I am not just referring to Q/Picard exchanges here either. the plot and dialog writing seem to be well above par. (as an almost lifelong Trekkie I can say that with some assurance of being accurate.) speaking of plot..here it is: Picard ""dies"" (whether or not he was really dead or just carted off is ambiguous)meets God Q and is given the truly rare opportunity to change a ""mistake"" and thereby avoid that senseless death. Of course he changes more than Just when he dies: He changes the sort of life that he led. Once he realizes how vital such aspects of his past truly are, he decides to change things back and an unusually compassionate Q let's him do it.Picard returns to the present with a new respect both for Q and for the events that helped shape him into who he is.This was got to be one of the most well thought out and imaginative plots and excecutions of the writing that the next generation ever had. serious thanks and congratulations!",10
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Tapestry (TV Episode 1993)",One of the best Trek episodes,"This episode is tight, both with plot and dialog. John de Lancie and Patrick Stewart always seem to bring out the best acting in each other whenever they interact on screen.Regarding the plot, this episode had a profound impact on me when I first saw it in my early 20s, and it has the same impact on me 15 years later. The take-away message: Seize every moment of life! Make your life worthwhile. No one writes stories about the person who always does what's expected but nothing more.Everyone should watch this episode every few years to evaluate where they are--are they following the Captain Picard path, or the Lieutenant Picard path? And is that the path they really want to be on?",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Tapestry (TV Episode 1993)",Everything I need to know about life I learned from Star Trek (especially this episode),"My eldest daughter has told me before that she sometimes regrets past choices and even views younger versions of herself with disdain. By way of response, I suggested that we should watch the Star Trek Next Gen episode ""Tapestry"" together as a family.In this episode, Q gives Captain Picard a chance to go back to an earlier point in his life and change some decisions that he regrets. Things don't work out for him so well though: his ""wiser"" choices ruin some friendships and he ultimately ends up a mediocre man in a tedious job. Q lets Picard go back (again) and put things right by making his youthful mistakes (again).In the closing scene, Picard tells Riker: ""There are many parts of my youth that I'm not proud of. There were loose threads, untidy parts of me that I would like to remove. But when I pulled on one of those threads, it unraveled the tapestry of my life."" When my daughter heard that, she said ""Wow"", and I got the impression that she had really grokked (""drunk deeply"") the message of this episode.And you know what, I grokked it too.",10

It brings to question what the afterlife is, does it exist, if you had a chance to change your past would you? Picard, mortally wounded in a Lenarian attack, meets Q in the afterlife. Q then offers the opportunity of reliving his past mistakes, including the incident where he needed to receive an artificial heart, and a chance to change things so he would live a safer life. But in the process, Picard comes to appreciate the life he has.It's amusing to see Picard in the Original Series Movie style outfit, as well as a TNG era Science Officer (Lt. Jr. Grade) outfit! A very intriguing episode indeed!Trivia note: Dr. Selar is mentioned again. Q also brings up people who have been dead - including Picard's father. And also the voices of the people who have died because of Picard's actions.",
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Tapestry (TV Episode 1993)","Q becomes the Ghost of Starfleet Past, Present and Future in this one!","This is one of my favorite Q episodes--and it's among my favorites of the series. Part of this is because of the excellent continuity with an earlier episode (""Samaritan's Snare"") and part of it is because the show clearly shows that Q IS a friend to Picard and is clearly helping him.When the show begins, Picard is dying as a result of some sneak attack. His fake heart has given out and the Doctor is trying desperately to keep him alive. Then, suddenly, Picard awakens and he's in what could be Heaven...that is until he sees that the part of God is being played by Q! Here Q is welcoming him to the afterlife, but Picard naturally believes that this is one of Q's tricks once again. Over the course of the show, Q allows Picard to time travel back to his impulsive period just after he's graduated from Starfleet Academy. This is because this is a HUGE regret for Picard--when he got his original heart destroyed in a foolish fight with some Nausicaans (which was alluded to in the prior episode). Picard always felt ashamed of this incident and his stupid youth--yet through the course of many flashbacks to his past and present, Picard comes to realize that his mistakes actually made him a better man and better leader.As I mention in the summary, this episode is highly reminiscent to Dickens' ""A Christmas Carole"" with Picard seeing alternate paths for his life. It ends much differently and has many wonderful moments (the best is when Picard awakens after a night of hot sex--you just have to see that one!). All in all, very memorable and a great episode about who the Captain really is down deep.",10
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Tapestry (TV Episode 1993)",There is no playing it safe,"'Tapestry' hits on the very real (and almost universal) human trait of regret; that need to do it all again for a different outcome. And there is a distinctly Dickensian ring to this. But one of the reasons I think this episode is so effective is that it gives Q (somewhat the perpetrator of all of this) some serious dramatic weight. I have to admit, I've never been hot on the character; he's usually played impishly and for comedic effect. But here, his disgust with humanity is played beautifully, and De Lancie's scenes with Stewart are a pleasure.The other reason is the pivotal turn - the wax-on, wax-off scene that brings it all together. Seeping Picard in science green and coasting on an adequate career is indeed jarring, and just about the clearest reminder that those things we regret are integral to who we are.It's an incredibly potent episode.9/10",9

Some mistakes in this episode. The bravest tiger is the first killed. I would see it as if he was reckless and arrogant his past would have involved sleeping with his best mate. The cowardly thing to do is not sleep with her. I could see him settling down having family. This regret over sex is total BS see the St original series. Can you see kirk regretting ? The whole ""fortune favours the brave"" is a young mans motto. When I see veterans with no arms, no legs, no eyes, I think there's an element of total BS in being brave in a film <<<<. Bit like the gambler who wins when needed, see also house, Real life does not save the day. Old brave heroes are the elite of the elite.... Very very lucky. The whole premise is that Picard becomes more risk averse. captain Picard is exemplary because of his diplomatic skills vs shoot to kill. I would see young Picard with a normal heart becoming too aggressive leading to mistakes. ....tl Dr: why would Picard become more risk adverse by not being stabbed in the heart? Isn't the whole point of Picard that he became more cautious..... Not impressed with the sneering tone on people who keep their head down. Irl. The first person to stick their head up gets shot and killed.",9
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Tapestry (TV Episode 1993)","Your ""mistakes"" make you who you are, own them.","What if Picard was a pitiable man whom commander Riker could describe as punctual, but not much else. What if he got that way by playing it safe when he was younger instead of standing up for his friends and fighting some Nausicaans. The moral lesson here is clear and the story which contains that lesson is well told. The Q Picard dynamic is the only thread running through the entire series, from Encounter at Far Point to All Good Things, and this episode really gives it strength. Picard's realization is touching and true to his character. Great episode for a rainy day! Watch once daily in place of your ordinary antidepressant.",10
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Tapestry (TV Episode 1993)",Picard gets an opportunity to fix his past,"As an away team returns Capt. Picard is rushed to sickbay with a serious chest wound. He apparently dies and everything he sees is white. A white clad figure approaches him; it isn't St Peter, it is Q! He explained that Picard died because his artificial heart failed. We learn that he lost his own heart after a run-in with a trio of Nausicaans shortly after he left the Academy. He tells Q that it was an act of regrettable recklessness; one of many regrets he has about that time in his life. Q offers to let him set right some of those things and takes him back to that time in his life just in time for him to be slapped by a woman who had just learnt he'd arranged for a date with another woman too. He sets about righting some of his youthful mistakes and in the process offends the other woman he'd arranged to date, sleeps with an attractive friend and prevents the fight with the Nausicaans which results in losing his friends but at least he keeps his heart. Q then returns him to the present; not the present he knew but that which followed the changes he made; he is no longer a decisive captain, instead he is a rather timid junior lieutenant in the Astro-engineering Department. This is not what he wanted and he learns that it was that youthful recklessness that made him the man he was meant to be.This is an interesting episode as it gives us a fascinating insight into Picard's past and how he became the man we know. Q is far less playful in this episode and mainly serves to give Picard a chance to change his past. This past includes some surprising details; I certainly didn't picture Picard as a womaniser! When we see the Nausicaans they are suitably unpleasant; definitely not the sort one would want to pick a fight with! The most interesting scenes come when Picard returns to the present to discover his actions have changed him to an overly cautious man who has lost the traits that made him a great leader. This also leads to the episode's one real problem; Picard's comments about the man he has become appears to show a contempt for such people does he really look upon those in relatively low positions as mere drones?! The cast do a fine job; most notably Patrick Stewart and John de Lancie as Picard and Q and J.C. Brandy who plays Picard's friend and love interest Ensign Marta Batanides. Overall an interesting and thoughtful episode.",9
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Tapestry (TV Episode 1993)","The message is, act like a moron in youth and you'll go far","I've never been so annoyed with an episode in my life. So as long as Captain Picard gets stabbed in a stupid, pointless fight and supports his shallow friends, he'll become a Captain instead of a lowly lieutenant. Because that incident CLEARLY defines who he is as a person, and he'll never do anything bold and ambitious after that. You know, Back to the Future had George McFly's entire future success predicated on whether he punched a guy or not, and at least that movie was funny. This episode never posits that there might have been better ways to go about the incident that DIDN'T cause you to lose a vital organ in the process. That there might have been a smart way to avoid a fight. It's all black and white, like the dreaded Star Trek V movie that says that every man's personality is based on his singular ""pain."" This strikes me as an episode that screams ""Picard is TOO like Kirk! Look! He's reckless and wild and stuff and that made him great!"" No, it's JUDGMENT that makes the character, and perhaps exercising skilled judgment at an early age might have made him an even better captain. But this episode (and Q's sanctimonious attitude only makes it worse) states that lacking good judgment equals having the ability to take chances. Why would you take a chance on that fight if it was essentially meaningless from the start? Is Captain Picard about taking risks on trivial matters just to show that he's a bold adventurer?This is a facile episode that's unworthy of the series as a whole. It adds to the Hollywood trend of glamorizing youthful recklessness as a rite of passage. Congratulations if you're among that minority to survive recklessness into a massively successful adulthood. The rest of you well you may be incapacitated, miserable or dead, but at least you're not MEDIOCRE, are you?",3

There are opposing forces that are at work here. First of all, the whole immutability issue. Events are tightly connected to one another and random acts create random results. The opportunities and choices are not self determined with an eye toward the future. When Picard decides to avoid trouble with those bad guys, he now engages in a whole new randomness. He should be aware of this, but Q forces him to see what happens. The second may have more to do with opportunity than with integrity. His being just a dull starfleet anyone is an interesting result of his ""inaction."" Many factors, among those the prejudicial decision of someone in power could have just as much to do with this. Also, is one act a definition of a person; especially where one's heart is in the right place (so to speak). This is an inconsistent, though provocative, episode.",7
11,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Tapestry (TV Episode 1993)",Entertaining as long as you don't think too deeply,"This was an interesting premise. Picard is mortally (?) wounded when his artificial heart is damaged by a phaser blast.
Q, in a typically entertaining turn, is there to guide him through the afterlife and offer him a second chance at keeping his original heart by sending him back 30 years to the incident where he lost it.
With his more mature perspective he goes about trying to avoid the fight that resulted in a knife through his heart. But in doing so, he changes his future and fails to become a captain, apparently because he played it too safe and didn't stand out.
For me, the writers were so eager to make a point about your mistakes building character and teaching you the importance of seizing your opportunities that they missed the fact that Picard had already made those mistakes and learned those lessons. To repeat them would be stupid, not character building. The Picard that was sent back had all the memories of his original life and all the authority of being a captain for many years. He would have stood out even more, and become captain quicker.
In fact it's surprising that Starfleet ever promoted him to captain in the first place, seeing as he lost his heart in a juvenile, unnecessary fight in a bar! That doesn't seem the sober judgement of a leader.
On the other hand, they had 40 minutes to tell the story, and maybe they took some short cuts. A more realistic telling of this story would need a double episode, Picard losing his memory of his future, and a less stupid incident to avoid in his youth.

I have always wondered why it never happened. It could have even happened in the TNG Movies, while DS9 was still on the air.But all we got was this meager episode.As an episode, important things happen for Data and Worf and Data did get to spend time with Bashir. Even though Bashir forgot to put his shoes back on for his last walk down the Corridor.Within the parallel Data/Worf stories there is an internal continuity. The Data story is rather interesting, but the Worf story, that's another missed opportunity.And of course this is one of James Cromwell's 3 TNG Appearances, this time, well, see if you can guess who he is? It took me a few viewings for me to figure out who he was in this.Look also for Tom Paris' ""father"" Richard Herd.

This mission doesn't feature in the story though; instead we get two plot threads each involving crew members and their fathers. In the first an alien approaches Worf with news that his father is not dead after all; instead he has been in a Romulan prison camp for the last quarter of a century. If true this would bring disgrace on Worf as a Klingon warrior would rather die than be taken prisoner. At first he is furious and calls the alien a liar but ultimately he decides he must go to the prison camp and discover the truth. In the second plot thread Dr Bashir comes aboard the Enterprise to investigate some equipment found in the Gamma Quadrant. While testing it a plasma discharge strikes Data rendering him unconscious. While unconscious he has a strange vision of his 'father' Dr. Noonien Soong, when he is awakened he is determined to discover is meaning; first through a series of paintings then by repeating the accident but this time without being revived before the vision has run its course.Since this is the first of a two part story it is all set up and little in the way of resolution. Having much of the story take place aboard Deep Space Nine was clearly designed to introduce fans of The Next Generation to that then new spin off series; unfortunately people who are already fans of DS9 are likely to be rather disappointed that the only main character from that series to appear here is Dr Bashir. Of the two stories Worf's is the more exciting and leads to a good cliff-hanger ending. Data's story is still interesting though as it is all rather mysterious and full of symbolism it left me intrigued to discover what it all meant. Away from the main plots there are some nice details; most notably when Dr Bashir observes that Data breathes and has a pulse as well as asking whether his hair grows rather than the usual questions about his capabilities.

But, it turns out things are NOT what they seem for the Romulans and Klingons have been living in peace here, with the former Romulan prison leader Tokath actually married a Klingon! Also, the Klingon children of the former prisoners also are not taught the Klingon ways.Now, it's up to Worf to give these children their ""birthright"". In the process, he learns more about this camp, about another secret Tokath is keeping. And perhaps, he can learn to overcome his on biases in the process. Watch and see!",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Birthright: Part II (TV Episode 1993)",More Klingon LIfe and Death With Honor Stuff,"When Worf arrives on the planet, seeking his father, he encounters a couple of generations. One generation is a group of old Klingons who have accepted their fate, living in relatively comfort with a Romulan commander, who has actually married and produced children with a Klingon woman. What happens is the usual ""right to express your Klingon being"" stuff that is genetic, I guess. Worf walks in and begins to disrupt the culture. The children, who are mixed race, begin to feel alienated, leaning toward their Klingon side. For about the fiftieth time, Worf decides to become a martyr rather than allow himself to be held, which is fine, but he is so full of himself that he doesn't recognize the delicate balance that exists here. We also get an answer to Data's dilemma, his recurring surreal dreams. This is interesting, but in the scope of things, not all that big a deal. I have one concern with the Worf thing. Where is the Prime Directive here?",7
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Birthright: Part II (TV Episode 1993)",Among the least of the two-part episodes.,"This second part of ""Birthright"" is better than the first part, though neither are especially good compared to the other two-parters from the series. In fact, most of the other two-parters are among the best shows--and so I was expecting so much more from this one.The first plot from part one involved Data having a near-death experience and trying to replicate it. However, inexplicably, this plot is completely abandoned here. Instead, the entire episode is about Worf once he lands on a planet filled with prisoners from the Kitimer Massacre and their children. Their Romulan jailers aren't exactly harsh with them--they're more like members of the same very passive and peace-loving community. In fact, they're like a model that illustrated that both races can live happily as peaceful beings--so it's up to Worf to destroy all this and show the Klingon children that violence, honor and death are the best ways.While the show is interesting and would have made a nice single episode of the series, it is no better and SHOULD be since the other two- part shows are all very, very good. Only about average.",7
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Birthright: Part II (TV Episode 1993)",A rather mixed message as Worf sows disharmony,"This episode begins where the previous one ended; with Worf being captured by the Romulans. He soon learns that this is a rather unusual prison; the Klingons don't consider themselves to be prisoners and live in harmony with their Romulan guards in fact we later learn that some of the younger members of the society are of mixed Romulan/Klingon parentage. Worf is horrified to see these Klingons living so peacefully with the Romulans so sets about teaching them about their warrior heritage and Klingon honour. As he continues to destabilise the community Tokath, the senior Romulan, gives him an ultimatum; start living by the communities rules or face execution.This, the second of a two part story, is rather strange; the first part had two distinct plot strands but this episode just follows one of them; there is no further mention of Data's visions and we never learn what the device Dr Bashir was investigating actually was he doesn't even feature in this episode. Worf's plot thread is interesting but goes in an uncomfortable direction; Worf discovers a small, peaceful community where long-time enemies the Romulans and Klingons live in harmony and the youngsters have never looked on Romulans as enemies instead of leaving them to live in peace he sets about lecturing then on how they should hate Romulans. Given that Star Trek has preached racial tolerance from its early days it is odd seeing a major character not only preaching hatred but it seems as though we are meant to think it is good that he is teaching the youth of this society to reclaim their warrior heritage. On the plus side the cast do a solid job; I've always liked Michael Dorn's Worf and it is nice to see him very much carry an episode while the rest of the main cast are hardly seen. Overall a very mixed episode; some good moments but also some uncomfortable themes.",7

The young Klingon he teaches to be a hunter kills an animal. And slaps it down on a table to show everyone that he is now a great hunter. That's what you do when you want to be a hunter. You kill animals. So the warrior thing. How does that work? You've got Klingons and Romulans in this place. How does a Klingon prove he is a great warrior? Duh! Using the hunter reasoning, kill a Romulan and slap him down on the table. That the elder Klingons joined Warf and could not see the obvious flaw is dumb.",5

He could be such a IoD nga'chuq!I hate to say ""Racist Worf"", but he was this way in ""The Enemy"", too. He could really naDevvo' me off sometimes.Maybe that is why his character had to endure so much, first Key'lehr, then Dax.This episode deals with Worf's Father's fate, and that in itself is yet another missed opportunity. It's the mother of all missed opportunities.This is the first time we get to hear actual Klingon music, and Worf gets to explain about what it means to people who had forgotten what it means, and to kids who did not know.Actually this episode deals with a subject that hits a deep nerve with Worf: The Attack on Khitomer and the killing of his parents by the Romulans, via the traitor Duras. Suddenly, Worf is surrounded by Romulans and apparently docile Klingons. He can't take it. He won't take it. But there are Klingon kids there, and Worf has a heart for them. Of course this causes a conflict with the Romulan leader of the camp, a conflict that didn't need to happen.And in true Worf fashion, he never backs down. This could have been a catastrophe, but Worf was lucky this time: That he was loved by a person whose existence offended him. That's a situation that could melt the hardest ice, and it does.But I do agree with one reviewer: Worf's obsession with Klingon Duty, Honour and Principles could be at times, tiresome.But that did not cause me to love the character less. It just made him more of a real person.Directed, for the first (and last) time by Dan Curry, who was very involved in creating the atmosphere of Trek through the 80's up to Enterprise. Most of the Klingon weapons, he designed, and figured out how they all worked. He even developed Worf's ""Tiger Crane"" style of training.",10

While everyone else left the ship attending a reception at Arkaria Base with a talkative Cmdr. Calvin 'Hutch' Hutchinson, Picard goes back for his horse saddle, only to realize and be captured by terrorists trying to take over the Enterprise (including Tim Russ, in another role before his famous Tuvok in Star Trek: Voyager). Picard is soon captured by the terrorists (telling them he's the barber Mott!) and even the reception becomes commandeered by the same terrorists!What do the terrorists want? Find out in this exciting action-oriented episode!Trivia note: Data tries his hand at ""small talk""! Also, we see Counsolor Troi wearing one of her old counselor outfits (since ""Chain Of Command"" she's been wearing her blue-colored officer's outfit). And, Picard does a ""Vulcan neck pinch"" on the future Tuvok!",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Starship Mine (TV Episode 1993)","Die Hard, Mister Ed- On Babylon 5!","This episode introduces the substance ""Trilithium"" - Originally as a Waste Product from the Warp Engines, this was changed to a Nuclear Inhibitor for the film ""Star Trek: Generations"" that for some reason, only the Romulans had access too. In This Ep which follows the Plot of ""Die Hard"" for some reason, the substance was being drained from a tap on the Warp Core, rather than from a secret Romulan Base.The Enterprise is to be cleared of all personnel for a ""Baryon Sweep"" - Which will kill any living matter in it's path. Picard beams back up to the Enterprise with Minutes to spare before the Sweep, to get his English Saddle. Down Below, the Enterprise Bridge Crew is expected to attend a reception given by ""Commander Hutchenson""/""Hutch"" - Which Picard was deviously trying to find a way to excuse himself from - After Denying Geordi the same thing! So, we have a ship full of Nobody, and the rest of the Bridge Crew attending a small ""party"" on the planet below. Recipe for Mischief, if you ask me.Of Course, Picard discovers ""Engineers"" aboard the Enterprise, who ought not be there - And so allows himself to be trapped on the Enterprise, in the path of a Sweep of Baryon Particles (Composite Particles of the Hadron family, along with Mesons) which will surely kill him if allowed to pass over his body.This is the scenario that has been set up by the Writer of this Ep, Morgan Gendel who wrote the Hugo-Award Winning story for 3rd Season 25th Ep, ""The Inner Light"".From this point on, this episode closely follows the film ""Die Hard"" - Starfleet personnel are held Hostage below, while Picard takes out the Enemies Above, One by One. According to the Trivia Section, there is even dialogue which follows Die Hard. And, as both Bruce Willis and Patrick Stewart both go ""Bald"" in a lot of their roles, this Ep is a very good Homage to the Action Films of Bruce Willis, and Picard holds his own very well- Since he does have superior knowledge of the Enterprise - These Trilithium Bandits have absolutely NO chance of succeeding.This Ep has both Patricia Tallman (Kiros) and Marie Marshall (Kelsey) who both had Memorable Roles on Babylon 5. We also have a non-starfleet appearance of Tim Russ as Devor, and Ironically, Picard takes him out with a ""Vulcan Nerve Pinch"" - Since this Ep follows the two-part ""Unification"" Episode where he meets Spock and had also shared Sarek's Mind in the 3rd Season Ep ""Sarek"" we must assume that Picard picked up that Knowledge of how to do a Nerve Pinch from Sarek. This also could be a reference to the Character Tuvok which Tim Russ would play in Voyager - Which Series began about 2 years after this ep.Glenn Morshower makes an appearance, not as Ensign Burke, but as the Alien ""Orton"" who Data initially bores with Small Talk. And finally, Data meets his Match in ""Hutch"" - Commander Hutchinson (David Spielberg), who is as good at talking about inane Trivia as Data is, they get along superbly- And this is Ironic.This is a fine Episode with the Next Generation tradition of telling two simultaneous stories at once, an aspect of this series which other series began following. The Last Two Lines of this episode, refer directly to the Theme Song from the show ""Mister Ed"" - Of Course!",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Starship Mine (TV Episode 1993)",The Enterprise Seems to Have Some Real Vulnerability,"I liked this episode because it is full of suspense and some cliffhanger events, but it does beg the question that whenever they dock for repairs, they seem to get themselves in trouble. Basically, who is minding the store. While the ship sits in dry dock to have a baryon scan (whatever that is; sorry science majors), Picard decides to go onto the ship to pick up a saddle so he can ride a horse that is available to him. He has been inundated with requests and decisions to be made and needs a little time to himself. While he is on the ship, he realizes there are others. A group of potential terrorists with an agenda to get their hands on trilithium, an extremely volatile substance. It is led by a ruthless woman who is willing to kill her partners. When he is captured, Jean-Luc pretends he is the Enterprise's barber. He hatches a plan to derail their efforts. Meanwhile, the other significant crew members are being held hostage by the confederates of these guys and must devise their own plan. Of course, the deadly baryon scan is moving forward, killing any living thing, so time is of the essence. Very good cliffhanger.",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Starship Mine (TV Episode 1993)",Data steals the Show,"While Picard gets most of the credit for his Bruce Willis imitation, and deservedly so, this may one of Data's greatest episodes. He is about as funny as I have seen in any episode. In fact I am convinced when he meets Commander Hutch, the scene was improvised. Look at Dr Crusher and Commander Riker closely. They have genuine laughter, like an unplanned script. Its almost like they expected Data to say one thing and he improvised and came up with something so funny they could not help laughing. It reminded of an SNL skit where they laugh during a skit. This is a great episode on different levels. There are some plot holes or it would get a 10.",9

officers and crew are doing a little R and R. What's happening to the Enterprise
is that it is undergoing what they call a Baryon sweep. Some highly toxic rays
are beamed into the ship to destroy any unfriendly microbes the ship picks up in
outer space.This is the time some terrorists decide to drain some unstable radioactive waste
from ship's engine. They have to do it in a certain amount of time or the toxic
rays will do them in.Two things go wrong. Patrick Stewart has to quickly return to the ship for 
something he forgot. Secondly several of the rest of the senior staff discover
something and they're taken hostage.Two performances really make this episode. The first is Marie Marshall as the
lead terrorist who is a tough and resourceful villain and equal to any male. In
fact truth be told she really hasn't much use for the male of the species which
she demonstrates on a few occasions.The second is David Spielberg their genial and talkative host on the space 
station the crew is on. He bores to tears just about everyone with his steady
stream of small talk. But Data is trying to master that art of making pleasant
conversation so the two go at it. Speilberg and Brent Spiner absolutely
hysterical one of the funniest moments in TNG history.Worth watching for that alone.",8

He wanted more fighting and.... um, effing. 
Well, there is certainly more fighting in this one-- and it's a welcome relief because it seems like his character was going through yet another stretch of pedestrianism. It's nice to remind the audience that Picard wasn't just cerebral-- he was a virile leader as well.
When you throw in Brent Spiner/Data's excellent comedy in this one you know that it's a classic.",9
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Starship Mine (TV Episode 1993)",Jean-Luc McClane,"I think it's completely fair to label this ""Die Hard on the Enterprise"" what with it being an excuse to see Picard as a fly in the terrorists' ointment. And while these hijackers lack Alan Rickman's charisma, there are a few clever touches that make this stand out. One is the Enterprise on lockdown, stations vacated and touch screens darkened, simple lighting tricks here and there that increase the eeriness. Also, the Baryon sweep, a looming threat that heightens the stakes.But it does come down to the bond between captain and his ship, and Patrick Stewart brings the physicality to defend it. He's pretty comfortable with a crossbow, too.7/10",7
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Starship Mine (TV Episode 1993)",Die Hard in space!,"Picard ends up stranded aboard the Enterprise as a team of bandits attempts to steal a toxic waste product to be sold and used as a weapon for terrorists. It's up to Picard to thwart them and save the day.This episode uses some rather convoluted plot devices (and some glaring plot holes) to try and recreate a Die Hard-type scenario for Picard. The end result is fun but terribly flawed episode.Picard as the action hero is great and his ventures as he McClanes his way through the Enterprise and eliminates the bad guys one-by-one are very fun to watch. He uses his superior knowledge of the ship an impressive amount of ingenuity to out-smart and out-maneuver the unwitting bandits. Probably his best move of all is telling them he is the barber, causing them to drastically underestimate him for the first half of the episode.Tim Russ shows up as the first of three Star Trek characters he will end up playing. He would later play a small part in Generations as a tactical officer aboard the Enterprise B, before landing his most well- known role as Tuvok on Voyager. While he great as Tuvok (easily the best and probably only good thing about Voyager), here he is entirely unremarkable, doing little and getting taken out early by Picard.The episode easily could have been a 9 or 10 if it weren't for the serious flaws in the writing. As I have re-watched the entire series, I notice that TNG has a serious problem with getting the bigger elements right but messing up on the details. This episode really exemplifies that, as explained below.Overall, though, this is still a fun and enjoyable episode in spite of its flaws.THE GOOD--Picard as John McClane, using his guile to outsmart the baddies. You almost feel bad for them because he is such a BA in this episode and you know they have no chance against him. And anybody who says Picard never wins a physical fight needs to see his slick takedown of Tim Russ' character. Of course he then proceeds to get beat up by a skinny woman later on. Ah well.-Picard pretending to be Mott, the barber. He's actually convincing as a helpless and scared civilian and it's fun to watch how completely they buy his story.-When Worf is given permission to not attend the reception but Geordi isn't. The smirk on Worf's face makes me laugh every time.THE BAD-Plot holes galore!-Picard has his comm badge but never tries to contact anybody. The baryon sweep obviously doesn't impede communication since the bandits are able to still communicate.-Picard's leisurely pace as he is trying to leave the Enterprise always annoys the heck out of me. He knows how little time is left and yet he barely hurries. When he tries to beam off and the transporter shuts down I find myself saying out loud, ""Well what did you THINK would happen, Picard?!""-The guys who take the senior staff hostage on the planet are impossibly incompetent. They sit there and watch and listen as the crew makes plans to stop them and they never try to interfere.-What is the bandits' plan? Why wouldn't their ship come and get them as soon as they have the Trilithium? Why wait until the sweep is nearly completed? And were they planning on just leaving the hostage-takers on the planet?THE UGLY-Trilithium in the episode is apparently something completely different from Trilithium in Generations. I suppose that technically that is a problem with the latter and not the former, but it is still annoying.-What happens to Commander Hutchinson? He gets shot and then isn't seen for the rest of the episode.-Tim Russ. It's nice to see him here, but it is somewhat insulting to the viewers to have the same actor play three different characters, each with virtually no makeup, as if we wouldn't notice or care.-Laforge says that the field diverter in engineering was necessary to protect sensitive equipment there. Since Picard destroyed it, was that equipment also destroyed?-I don't like it when non-Vulcans use the nerve pinch. Supposedly there is a mental component to the nerve pinch, since the Vulcans have some telepathic powers, but having Data and Picard both do it in TNG (Data does it in Unification) goes against that idea.-Do the bandits' weapons even work? They never fire them. Would explain why they don't just kill or stun Picard when they have the chance. It makes no sense for them to drag him along with them and give him more opportunities to mess up their plans. But if the weapons don't work then why have them?-Picard is very destructive in this episode. He kills at least 7 people (maybe more, depending on how many are on the ship), cuts up multiple jeffries tubes, wrecks engineering, sets off an explosive in ten-for, and destroys the bandit ship. He also raids Worf's quarters for weapons.",7
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Starship Mine (TV Episode 1993)",Die Hard with the Next Generation,"This episode goes down exactly like Die Hard 1, except instead of Bruce Willis it's Patrick Stewart, and instead of his wife being held hostage it's the senior staff. All in all, this is a pretty good little episode, but it has some major plot holes which is discouraging because they were on a good plot-hole-free streak and now it's ruined. Here's what went wrong: First, if all they wanted was trilithium there were probably easier ways to get it than messing with the best ship/crew in Starfleet. Besides, couldn't they have left Data on board? The sweep didn't affect any other devices on the ship.Then, Picard tricks Sattler by leaving his uniform by a door with the sweep just on the other side, which is just stupid. If I saw his clothes I would have gotten the heck out of there, I definitely could outrun that slow sweep. Yet he is not the only one to die this way. Later his partner says that he found Sattler dead and retrieved a communicator from Picard's uniform. How is this possible. Once the sweep had been thru that area there would be no way thru to the other side, and without power, there could be no transporting. Which brings me to two more points. How did Picard get on board in the first place, and if he had a communicator why didn't he just transport the enemy into space and himself back to the surface, or at least to a part of the ship that had already been swept? Then after their original unknown plan fails in Engineering they decide to go to Ten Forward, then IMMEDIATELY after that the sweep is shown PAST engineering. Not cool. Meanwhile on the planet we have a couple of REALLY bad hostage takers. They let the senior officers come up with a complete plan and execute it all in front of their very eyes, and Riker just waltzes up and casually converses with them, lax with their phasers, and just beats them up, but ""lets"" himself get beat-down to create the distraction. Why didn't the crew just rush them at this point? Forget plan A when plan B arises and it's better! All this to execute a foggy plan ""Data once we're all unconscious get to that computer over there and make it all better!"" I've heard of better plans to stake your life on I'll tell you that much.During the episode there is a lot of fighting and it is all very very bad. Like the episode in the original series where Kirk fight the saurian. Just bad, unbelievably bad action. Picard gets his rear handed to him by a girl for god's sake. I've seen him with his shirt off, he's not that feeble looking, he could knock a girl out. Especially with his experience and training.Why were the lights on if there was no power either? Then to further prove the plot hole earlier of ""how did Picard get on the ship when it had to no power to the transporters?"" he screams to some miscellaneous array controller guy STOP THE SWEEP!. Why didn't he just call his ride and get a transport? Back to the bad writing again, and it's a shame.For the record Picard personally killed or acted in a way that led to the deaths of at least 5 mercenaries in this episode and he didn't bat an eyelash doing it, or lose a wink of sleep. (Tuvok, Sattler, the merc he shot with the crossbow and knockout arrows, and the two women in the shuttle at the end - the other mercs just ""disappeared"" in the sweep - but he could have done some of them in too for all we know.) YET with his wonderful conversation with the Merc known as Tuvok he tries to ""interrogate"" him and when he fails Tuvok says ""You won't kill me, you are starfleet."" Yet he claims 5 confirmed kills in this episode. Tuvok included. You can't run from a sweep if you are unconscious - he killed them because he made them unconscious.Trivia: Tim Russ (Tuvok) was seen acting as the mercenary Devor in this episode. I love how they re-use major actors in the series like Tim Russ (Tuvok), Michelle Forbes (Ro Laren),and Marc Alaimo (Gul Dukat) over and over like no one will ever notice.

Instead of the usually quiet and passive sort of guy who is NOTHING like Kirk, here he's a bloodthirsty killer--and I like it!!The Enterprise is docked at a space station as the ship is being swept with Baryon. I have no idea what this is (nor does anyone watching the show) but apparently it cleans the ship AND will kill whoever it touches! So, the crew all beam to the station for some R&R. However, Picard decides to go back to the ship to fetch something and finds that space pirates are aboard and they are planning on stealing the ship's trilithium in order to sell it to terrorists! So, uncharacteristically, Picard stealthily runs about the ship killing off the pirates one at a time.An additional plot is a humorous one where Data is trying to learn small-talk. He is incredibly dull so the crew sicks him on the man running the space station, as he's also incredibly dull and the pair end up having a ball!The show is exceptional in every way--unusual, exciting, tough and, at times, funny. This show is simply among the very best.",10

This entails the use of a 'baryon sweep'; a process that is deadly to living tissue so necessitates the evacuation of the ship. As the senior crew attend an event hosted by the facilities rather boring commander Picard learns that that there are horses there so decides he must go for a ride. While retrieving his saddle from the Enterprise he bumps into an engineer and is suspicious as the ship should have been fully evacuated by now. He confronts the man and is attacked. With the Enterprise powered down he can't get off the ship so sets about finding out what is going on; it turns out a gang is using the baryon sweep as an opportunity to steal trilithium from the ship's engine; this extremely volatile substance will sell for a tidy profit. Picard sets about thwarting the gang's plans, all the time staying in front of the deadly sweep. Meanwhile back at the reception Georgi notices a strange energy signature which leads to staff members reaching for hidden weapons; Geordi is shot and wounded and the others are held hostage.This is a rather exciting episode and it was certainly nice to see Picard forced to take the roll of action man rather than one of the younger crewmembers. Patrick Stewart does a fine job making us believe that the usually restrained captain has it in him to take on the thieves. There are plenty of fun moments during their cat and mouse chase through the ship; notably when he tells the bad guys that he is Mr Mott the barber and later when he brings one of the bad guys down with a crossbow! The action on the station starts well with Data trying to learn small talk by observing the local commander; this leads to some amusing scenes as they out-bore each other! Once the action starts things here weaken a bit; these must be the worst hostage takers ever as they allow our protagonists to walk around and make plans to fight back they must also be deaf as the discussions about how to defeat them were hardly whispered! The guest cast did a pretty good job; it was nice to see Tim Russ, who will later become a main character in 'Star Trek Voyager' and Patricia Tallman, a 'Babylon 5' regular, appear among the villains.

And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily.

Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish.

He plays along with computer generated music all by himself. He is immediately attracted to this woman and the loneliness of his position becomes a force with which he must deal. He is her superior on the Enterprise and there are understandings. Just because her role is research doesn't mean she may be required to perform a dangerous mission given the right circumstances.

It turns out the attraction is mutual and they soon become romantically entangled.Picard soon contemplates whether he should pursue a romance with someone under his command, and this comes to a test when she is part of an Away Team on Bersallis III that may threaten her existence.Trivia note: we see the flute from ""The Inner Light"" again (when Picard and Daren play together - she is on her portable piano). And EXCELLENT use of music when Picard and Daren are playing together (especially of the theme from ""The Inner Light"". We also see another concert that Data is part of, playing the violin again.",
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Lessons (TV Episode 1993)",Lessons? What lessons?,"Summary: Picard learns the hard way that business and romance don't mix.Jean-Luc Picard is ""a very private man"". We don't see him connect to other people on a personal level very often. So it's a welcome change to have the captain meet and fall for a woman for once.As an added bonus, his love-interest (Cmd. Daren) is written pretty well and we can buy him falling in love with her: She's brilliant, cultured, witty, outspoken and physically attractive enough. Plus Picard and her actually have common interests besides working on a starship - something Hollywood frequently ignores when matching up characters. The actual ""falling in love""-moment is done very well, with Picard talking about his experience during ""The Inner Light"". Both the writing and acting are good and help to sell that scene.When they get together, it's TNG's format which instantly raises alarm-bells with the audience: We know that the laws of a weekly TV-show won't allow Picard to fall for a guest-star character and stay with her. So right from their first kiss, we wonder how the writers will break up the newly formed relationship. And it's here where the plot falls apart.After a false lead involving Picard's awkward treatment of her in public, the story goes for the obvious choice: Placing Picard in a position where he has to put his love-interest in a dangerous situation. It's done in such a rushed way that you can almost feel the writer's desperation to have everything ""back to normal"" by the end of the episode.And it just doesn't ring true. Picard has put his senior officers into countless life-threatening situations before. Including Dr. Crusher who he clearly has feelings for. He never asked her or anyone else to apply for a transfer. Plus: How realistic is it for the head of stellar cartography to be part of a dangerous away mission like the one in the show (or in fact any dangerous away mission)? She struck me more as the brainy type, someone who'd run experiments in a laboratory. Not someone who'd routinely run around on dangerous planets or who'd get sent into a firefight.To me, it would've been much more interesting if the writers had actually dared to keep Daren on the show for a couple of episodes. It would've broken the ""reset everything for the next show""-routine and would have been a nice opportunity to explore the Picard-character as a private man.As it is, the title of the show doesn't have any real meaning: What lesson did Picard learn? It's pretty standard knowledge that mixing business and romance can be tricky (although other characters like Riker don't seem to have a problem with it at all). And the way they both agree to end their relationship isn't earth-shattering either: Nobody really gets hurt and come next episode, the Daren-character is completely forgotten. So there are no real lessons or consequences here.6/10",6

And the fact that this a semi sequel makes it even better. (to The Inner Light). I see it as an ongoing story, it is a sort a story a captain should have plenty of. That is what makes him who he is. And that is challenged in this episode. Identity is the question in the face of love. Again make note of the use of music. It is refined, maybe strong words for what it is, but is it not just that. Also all the small stuff, the familiar stuff. The tea, the night watch, the different parts of the ship. 10 Forwards. The fact that they have a grand piano. Datas observations. Then the crises, things are in motion, and a resolution. Rhythm is key. And much Zen to produce this. Not always success, but from time to time something like this(I don't know this, pure speculation). Modern CGI would do a difference here and there, but where would we be then? 8 out of 10 yes. Again I cry, not for the loss of his love, but for the memory that is inside Piccard. The pain of the ""unknown"" loss, the spring of the music they played and he to her, gone. If that was to come pass the strength found in playing the flute becomes poison to him. Never again, But then the story unfolds and the loss is not that big. But The Captain found the way, and the way was to part. D.",8
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Lessons (TV Episode 1993)",A love for Picard,When Picard gets up at three in the morning he is somewhat annoyed that several systems are down at the request of the Stellar Cartography department; unable to do what he planned or even have a cup of Earl Grey he goes to see what can be so important that key systems must be taken off line. Here he meets department head Lt. Commander Nella Daren. He finds himself attracted to her and after discovering that they share a love of music they start spending more time together. He plays the Ressikan flute that he got in the episode 'The Inner Light' and tells her about the events of that episode. As their relationship develops it makes things a bit awkward for Riker as Daren asks him for the allocation of resources and personnel; routine requests that any section head might request but made awkward because she is seeing Riker's boss. Then the Enterprise is called in when a dangerous firestorm approaches a Federation outpost and her skills mean she is called on to take part in the evacuation. The storm is worse than expected and it looks as if a couple of the away teams may have been lost; including Daren's. Back on the Enterprise Picard feels helpless and unable to function properly.This is one of those episodes that is more about the emotions and relationships of the crew rather than about the action. The action that we do see is there to serve the emotional side of the story. It was nice to see Capt. Picard forming a relationship that went beyond friendship especially when it managed to link to 'The Inner Light'; one of the series best emotional episodes. This episode does have one major weakness; the nature of the series meant we know from the start his relationship would be over before the episode was. It would have been nice if the relationship could have been allowed to last a few episodes so its end wasn't so obvious at least they avoided the cliché of having her killed and dealt with the difficulties Picard would have sending her of further away missions. Guest star Wendy Hughes did a fine job as Daren; the relationship between her and Patrick Stewart's Picard was believable and touching; I especially liked their playing music in the Jeffrey's tubes. Overall a good emotional episode.,8

My daughter kept rooting for Daren to be evil and I assumed she'd be dead by the end of the show.

I really appreciate the references to this earlier (and fantastic) episode and it made Picard's playing for Daren a lot more special.

The episode doesn't really warrant 10 stars...but it IS the most important single episode of the the Star Trek mythos.The first part of the question is: probability fails to explain why (virtually) all the aliens have great similarities to each other, and to standard homo sapiens. The second part of the question is trickier, tho':How can all these humanoid sapients breed interbreed? Without an episode like this this to definitively give the only possible answer, SHARED GENETIC ANCESTRY, it would be impossible. Indeed, even with shared genes, inter-breeding is exceedingly unlikely without assistance. Humans are genetically closer to other terran apes, yet we cannot successfully breed with them (or so i am reliably informed).This question was vaguely addressed in an episode of the original Star Trek, where a humanoid alien speculates that he may have been our (humanities') ancestor, but until recently, we have ALL agreed that a fact is better than a guess.In fact, I would place the last 10 minutes of this episode as a preamble to anyone starting to experience Star Trek.",10
10,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Chase (TV Episode 1993)",At last the question 'Why do aliens look so human?' is answered,"Capt. Picard's is happy when his old mentor Professor Galen pays a surprise visit to the Enterprise although he has to decline his offer to take part in an expedition which could lead to the most important archaeological discovery of the era. Upset at having been turned down Prof Galen departs to carry on with his expedition. Shortly afterwards his shuttle is attacked; the Enterprise attempts to rescue him but is too late and he dies. An investigation shows that the attackers took some computer data but enough is left for Picard to start an investigation. After a little while it becomes apparent this data relates to DNA fragments found in various parts of the galaxy and that if all the fragments can be recombined a program will be activated. Heading to the planet Galen said he was going to the Enterprise finds that the Cardassians are already there and the Klingons arrive soon afterwards; no one has all of the code so they eventually agree to work together and combine the strands each of them has found; still there is some missing so the race is on to get the last strand. When it is found they are joined by the Romulans then when the final strand is put into place a message from billions of years ago is played.This is an interesting episode, because it brings together Cardassians, Klingons, Romulans and Humans together for the first time. It also answers the question of why just about all the intelligent life encountered are humanoid. Before this final revelation we get some exciting moments although it isn't as tense as it could be one would have thought bringing the four main 'Star Trek' species together for the first time would have been a bit more dramatic. The reaction to the message explaining the relationship between the races is also a bit disappointing with nobody being as effected as one might expect. Fans of 'The Avengers' might be interested to note that this episode features Linda 'Tara King' Thorson as Cardassian Gul Ocett; although she is almost unrecognisable under her make-up. Overall an interesting episode which isn't quite as good as it could have been.",8
11,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Chase (TV Episode 1993)","This reminds me of Raphie and his decoder ring in ""A Christmas Story"".","This episode begins with one of Picard's old professors coming to the Enterprise to ask Jean-Luc to quit his job and follow him on some expedition. The Captain isn't about to do this, though he is hesitant to disappoint the man. Well, after telling him about this, the professor leaves--and is soon attacked! It seems that the Klingons and Cardassians are after the same thing the professor wants--the answer to a puzzle buried within our DNA! After a while, the Romulans also join in the hunt and it seems that everyone is hoping the answer would be power to smite their enemies. The real answer, however is a HUGE disappointment to some--especially the Klingons who just want to kill something!This is an okay episode...just okay. This is because of all these warlike races coming together, you'd expect much more excitement and mayhem. It lacks both and is only moderately interesting.",6

As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 06This sixth somehow seems to have hold down the train of enthralling compartments, the concepts are still fresh and comes in with new perspective but unfortunately the storytelling isn't as engaging as the previous seasons.The ChaseIn true sense, it attempts to find the answer of the genre sci-fi the final countdown may not end in a gratifying note, there is an adequate response from us that beams back the last act to be familiar and frankly also fun.",
0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Frame of Mind (TV Episode 1993)",Excellent episode.,"ST:TNG:147 - ""Frame Of Mind"" (Stardate: 46778.1) - this is the 21st episode of the 6th season of Star Trek: The Next Generation.Continuing the grand tradition of superior writing during the 6th season, this episode concerns what reality is, what makes a person insane. While Riker is rehearsing the part of a mental patient trapped in a asylum for another of Dr. Crusher's play ""Frame Of Mind"", he starts experiencing paranoid sensations when he runs into a crew member that seems oddly familiar (a mysterious Lt. Suna). When he tells Troi about this, she brushes off his concerns as a side effect of getting into his mentally-charged role.However, during his first performance, his set disappears and he finds himself imprisoned in a Tilonus mental ward, accused of murder! But what is real? Is he really insane? Find out in this highly-charged episode.Note: GREAT use of visual effects, music, and cinematography in this episode.Trivia: this episode stars Susanna Thompson as Inmate Jaya (she will later have a claim to fame as one of the Borg Queens in Star Trek: Voyager).",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Frame of Mind (TV Episode 1993)",A phenomenal episode,"This is an episode that keeps you guessing. The other reviewer gets it right - except does not mention that it is completely unclear by the end of this what actually happened. Was Riker really kidnapped? Or was this play more complex than that? We see this from Riker's perspective - but it is unclear whether it was Riker the actor of the play, or Riker the victim of the madness that is this episode. The scene in which the audience is applauding while Riker seemingly has a panic attack underscores this - is it an illusion cast by the aliens, or is this merely a part of the play? This is one that makes you think, and you'll definitely go ""huh?!"" throughout it. But it is nonetheless well written and very well acted. One of Jonathen Frakes' best performances in the series.",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Frame of Mind (TV Episode 1993)","""Star Trek meets The Twilight Zone""....","A truly unusual and unsettling episode that, although I've never seen it show up in viewer polls, surely ranks as one of the series' best in terms of writing, directing, and acting. The disturbing and surreal atmosphere that haunts every minute of ""Frame of Mind"" is eerie and effective- so much so that the viewer half expects to see Rod Serling step into the picture at any moment.Jonathan Frakes steals the show with his best and most intense performance of the entire series. Guest star David Selburg (Dr. Syrus) must also be commended for a first-rate turn as a calmly rational and calculating alien psychiatrist.The acting and storyline are so much fun to watch that the viewer can easily overlook the two major plot holes inherent in this episode- and they are big ones. First, why is Riker, of all people, sent on this dangerous mission in the first place? He's the First Officer on the Federation flagship, a man with enormous responsibilities for the critical day-to-day operations of a ship with more than 1000 people on board- is it really logical to risk such a highly experienced & hard to replace starship officer on a mission to rescue some Starfleet researchers who have no particular importance? (At least no particular importance was mentioned). The Enterprise has over 1000 people on board- is there really no other crew member trained to do this? And doesn't Starfleet Security have special, better trained people for this type of hostage recovery work? (""Star Trek: Enterprise"", for example, which was set two hundred years before this series, featured special ""Marines"" on-board the Enterprise NX-01 that were specially trained & armed for exactly this type of mission).Second, in TOS episode ""Patterns of Force"", Dr. McCoy implanted small tracking devices into Kirk & Spock so that Scotty could keep a transporter lock on them & beam them out in case any trouble happened on their dangerous away mission. He did this relatively quickly & easily with a small device about the size of a hypo-spray. What happened to this technology? Was it abandoned by Starfleet? (Or maybe forgotten by the show writers?) Seemed like a pretty good idea. In any event, towards the end of ""Frame of Mind"" we see Riker's communicator lying right next to him in the alien interrogation room. Can't a communicator serve as a homing beacon for the ship's computer? True, Riker wasn't wearing it, but he happened to be in the same room with it- why not lock on to that communicator signal & beam a security team down to its location have a look around/stage a rescue? Or, at the very least, beam a probe/camera down to the communicator's location and have a look around.Big plot holes, indeed, but it certainly doesn't diminish the power and entertainment value of this episode. Well worth your time- I give it a 9 out of 10.",9
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Frame of Mind (TV Episode 1993)",Riker in the Snake Pit!,"This Matrix-like plot with numerous twists and turns is really quite engaging. It involves Will Riker, who is rehearsing for a play. He is really quite good and the performance with Beverly Crusher at the helm (directing) is going to be performed soon. Suddenly, he finds himself in a facility for the insane. He is told he has killed someone and because of his insanity, he may be free from prosecution. Something has happened to his mind and he is trying to cope, but he slowly becomes institutionalized. There are layers upon layers of reality. We don't know if we are seeing his mind's eye or there is a true reality. He slowly begins to accept where he is. He even meets what appear to be Picard, Worf, and Troi, but even they turn out to be illusions. This is really a quirky episode with Jonathan Frakes putting in a very exciting performance.",9
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Frame of Mind (TV Episode 1993)",Star Trek The Next Generation--Frame of Mind,"I really love it when Star Trek—The Next Generation approaches telling a story outside the conventional box, like in the case of ""Frame of Mind"". What if what you consider reality is but a dream and actually you are a nutcase who killed someone savagely with a knife and are currently confined to an asylum on a world alien to your own? The Enterprise feels like it is but fictitious imagery disrupting what is real, popping up as Riker is on a planet called Telonius, in a cell for the mentally insane. He's told by his doctor and staff that he was responsible for a bloody murder. He's told by the doc that the Enterprise isn't real, just possible manifestations that are holding him back. Riker goes back and forth from the cell (and cafeteria and ""playroom"") and the Enterprise, becoming increasingly disoriented and losing control until he starts to consider what the Telonius tell him as true. This episode does a swell job of producing absolute confusion, doing so by setting it from the maddening perspective of Riker, and through this what is real/unreal is skewed. There's a play Beverly Crusher once again burdens a crew member pal of hers with called Frame of Mind about an asylum inmate under interrogation by a psychiatrist (Riker, the inmate; Data, the interrogator) that morphs from stage into the real thing for Riker during performances, with a particular Teloniun ""Administrator"" (played by cult star Andrew Prine) who turns up on the Enterprise as an officer while at the asylum he's a member of the staff. So Riker must break down the illusion so he can stop those responsible for his cerebral fiction, but it will not be easy. This is a plum episode for the Riker character and an acting powerhouse for Jonathan Frakes. It is quite an unpleasant road traveled for Riker, though. There's one point where he does consider the Enterprise members figments of his imagination, even during an instance where Data and Worf seem to be trying to help him escape with him helping the staff stop them from doing so. Again, though, while such a scene offers the possibility that Riker's on the verge of rescue, it all is determined to be false manifestations; again, it illustrates the whole point of throwing us for a loop. I love how the conclusion has Riker tearing down the real stage play set as to cleanse himself from the whole experience. There's also a nifty point of emphasis on a cut on the head of Riker that seems to constantly re-appear; it plays a heavy part in Riker's taking control of his psyche and ruins the whole process of requiring deeply latent strategic plans wanted by those who kidnapped him. To conclude, this episode puts Riker through the ringer, and I imagine it was quite the grueling experience for Frakes to remain in such a dark period for his character. Superb episode in a series that continued to remain amazing all the way to the end.",8
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Frame of Mind (TV Episode 1993)",Beyond the lighted stage,"This reminds of of a piece of trivia for the movie ""Manhunter"". That William Petersen had to shave his head after production wrapped just to shed and completely distance himself from his character; life imitating art, given that Will Graham had to do pretty much the same in the film.Will Riker's put in a similar position, tasked with the lead role in Beverly's play, but finding his character bleeding into reality. And Frakes bears it well, ably wearing the exhaustion and panic of a man who can't tell which way is up. It's a highly effective episode, full of turns, skilled misdirection and an actor who's up to the task.8/10",8

The journey through Riker's unconscious mind is quite engaging as he struggles to ascertain what's real and what's not. Frakes portrayal of confusion, frustration, disorientation, anger, and eventual realization are quite convincing and reason enough to enjoy this episode. The ending is a hand wave as Riker realizes he's dreaming, wakes up and beams away. A line of dialogue from Troi explains how he managed and the episode is over.

The 'doctor' insists that the Enterprise and its crew are Riker's delusions and he's never been in Starfleet! What's happening?!This episode is like a dream within a dream within a dream--and it's seriously weird.

Hes been the main character in a play prior to taking this mission and at first he thinks he knows the difference but every time he thinks hes acting, the stage and the characters become real. Has his life on the Enterprise been all in his mind? Are his close friends just different aspects of his personality? Did he really kill another man in an alley? Was it on purpose or self defense?This episode does a good job of blurring these lines and keeps the viewer on their toes. Even when hes being told the truth and we think his real friends are trying to help him, that ""reality"" is shown to be imagined also. Once Riker starts to take control, everything unravels.

Later as he prepares for an away mission Worf accidentally cuts him with a dagger and he goes to sickbay for treatment; after it is treated he still feels pain. Later that night he and Data perform the play to much applause apart from the unknown alien officer who just stares at him. As he takes a bow the audience vanishes and he finds himself being questioned by an alien doctor; he is in fact in an alien asylum and his captors tell him that the idea that he is a commander on the Enterprise is part of a psychotic delusion. He refuses to believe them and several times he finds himself back aboard the Enterprise only for that reality to shatter leaving him in the asylum ultimately he can't believe anything he sees or experiences; even a rescue attempt proves to be a delusion. Will he ever find reality again and will he recognise it if he does?This is one of the darkest episodes of the entire series; both in terms of its tone and literally thanks to the darkened interrogation room. Most of the time the viewer is as much in the dark as Riker as to what is real and what is a drug induced delusion. We don't know why he is being accused of murder or whether or not he has actually killed anybody; we can assume it is linking to his away mission but that is only speculation as it is first referred to during one of his delusional episodes. The whole cast does a fine job but it is Jonathan Frakes who carries the episode with a brilliant performance; he convinces us that Riker is slowly losing his mind thanks to what his happening; he perfectly captures Riker's frustration, confusion and despair. Overall I must say this was a brilliant episode; fans of films like 'Perfect Blue' and 'Inception' that feature delusions within delusions and we rarely know what is real should love this I did!",10

Well, I maintain that he is a much better director than actor, but he is probably at his all-time best in Next Gen history in this episode. He did a good (not great, but good) job of delivering a convincing performance in a dark setting and dark story. Also, I applaud the writers for steering the season away from season five and early season six's childish banalities and into more grounded adult terrain.

Ms. McFadden invests her character with a dignity and determination that is admirable and worthy of note. The story itself is plausible as the good doctor investigates what seems to be the results of a tragic experiment that has failed.

I mean to... I'm not sure what. Why didn't Dr. Reyga come on the ship alone to prove his theory? Instead we have a bunch of unrelated, unrealistic characters on the ship(with many racist and stupid statements about Ferengi and/or Klingon scientists being unheard of... blah blah blah...

That would prove the shield worked, wouldn't it? No, it's more important to risk a sentient life for the sake of the story. I know he volunteered, doesn't matter, in the real world it wouldn't have even been brought up. Star Trek does this all the time, too.Also, sorry but Dr. Crusher would still have been fired. She still performed that autopsy didn't she? That is all but forgotten at the end of the episode because the mystery is solved, but why would that make any difference to the Ferengi? She still disobeyed a direct order from her captain and nearly caused an interplanetary incident. I think that's at least worthy of a hearing or something. She stuck her nose where it didn't belong and it blew up in her face. She deserved a serious reprimand at least.",2
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Suspicions (TV Episode 1993)","A slow paced mystery drama, not bad but lacking something...","A ""Dr. Crusher"" show that gives the reliable & likable Gates McFadden a chance in the spotlight, and, in script form, must have appeared like a potentially exciting & intriguing mystery drama.Unfortunately, this installment moves at such a slow pace (especially the first half) that the viewer's mind has long since wandered away when the action (what little there is) begins, and so it's difficult to really jump back into the story as things start to happen again (as if we were ever there to begin with). The problem here is really threefold: 1. The characters, while visually interesting and very sincerely played, come off as utterly passionless and devoid of any energy or enthusiasm. The whole cast goes through the entire episode as if they are heavily medicated- even Picard looks bored throughout most of the show. Peter Marx as the Ferengi scientist Dr. Reyga tries to inject a little emotion into the piece, but he, too, seems far to subdued & calm most of the time, considering that the Ferengi are generally pretty outrageous in their speech & mannerisms.2. This episode is very, very ""talky"", with much quiet dialogue and very little action. This approach works fine in Star Trek when the idea being talked about relates & connects to the viewer emotionally in some way (Data's personal rights & freedom on trial in ""The Measure of a Man"", for example, or characters falling in love, etc.), but here the subject in question is an obscure shielding technology that we really never understand or get our arms around, and so we can't really relate to the subject being discussed. Hence we never feel ""drawn in"" to the show the way the best Star Treks will allow us to be. We just end up standing off at a distance the whole time, detached, watching the characters do their thing and trying to figure out what's going on.3. Finally, for the viewer to remain interested for an hour, in the absence of a strong emotional or intellectual bond to the subject there needs to at least be some action (this is is supposed to be a space adventure, after all) and there simply isn't enough action in this piece to fill in the void. A brief physical confrontation between Dr. Crusher and a female Klingon scientist ends as soon as it begins, and ends up looking contrived; the other brief action sequence is stuck right on the end, appearing almost as an afterthought.The regulars and guest stars are not to blame here- all are excellent, as are the costumes and make-up (James Horan as Dr. Jo'Brill in particular gives us an alien species that is very striking visually).The fault (if any, because it's not a BAD show) lies with the script, and, even there, it's not so much the writing as it is the fact that it's not particularly well suited to production as a Star Trek adventure- it would have been much better as an episode of ""Columbo"".Watching ""Suspicions"" can be compared to sitting on the sidelines and watching a friend play a favorite video game- it might be a great game, even visually interesting at times, but since you can't participate, you never really get into it.",5

Things are now told in flashback. A Ferengi scientist (who would normally not have been taken seriously) has supposedly developed a method of protecting the crew of a ship as it enters the corona of a star. The alien who pilots the ship is killed in the process and the Ferengi is discredited by the other scientists on board to observe. However, it isn't long before the big eared alien is himself killed. As is often the case, Beverly goes overboard and performs an autopsy, against the wishes of the family. She has put herself in a position of destroying her career in Star Fleet as well as in the medical profession. She is a complex character because there is no one so adamant about correct and fair treatment of patients. Anyway, she manages to alienate the guests and bring disgrace on herself. In order to clear her name, Guinan suggests that she find a way, no matter the risk. So she takes out a shuttle craft to investigate the forces that affected the original probe into the star's outer layer. It's a mystery story and it works pretty well.",7

Also present is a female Klingon scientist (Kurak - Tricia O'Niel) and a Vulcan Warp Field specialist (T'Pan-Joan Stuart Morris) with her Human husband Dr Christopher (John S. Ragin) - And a tall lanky Takarian named Jo'bril- Played by James Horan (Col. Cummings of ""Gods and Generals"").Reyga has made a Breakthrough in Shielding that could be a huge benefit to all of these races - If only he were not a Ferengi, he'd be taken seriously. Ferengi are this Trek's ""Alien Trash of the Galaxy"" and usually look for any kind of advantage in Profit for any endeavor they perform.But Crusher sees that this is a most unique Ferengi, who is simply wanting to be respected in the Scientific Community.These four Scientists, Vulcan, Klingon, Takarian, Ferengi would normally never even speak to each other under regular circumstances. But the circumstances aboard the Enterprise are hardly ever Regular.But something happens - Reyga's experiment works, then does not work, then someone dies, then does not die. Crusher smells Sabotage but cannot prove it without going against the medical wishes and Funerary Traditions of another Race. But being Crusher she has to try - To get to the bottom of this mystery, and she'll risk her career to et to the Truth.This Episode introduces a new scientific ""Gimmick"" into the fabric of The Next Generation - Look for this ""gimmick"" - As well as James Horan, in Season 6 Ep 26 and Season 7 Ep 1, parts I and II of ""Descent"".Guinan of course, does not return until ""Star Trek: Generations""",10

I thought I had seen them all before, but this one must have slipped through back then.Watching this is like reading a book. Just relax and enjoy. There is no action or space battles.Most of the episode is told in a 'flashback'-style where Crusher tells Guinan (my favorite Star Trek character) about how she got herself kicked off the Enterprise and is now awaiting a trial back at Starfleet. We all know she continues her role, so no spoiler there.Many think this is a 'slow' episode, and I'm sure it's a 'bottle-neck' episode (made cheaply to save money for other episodes), but I liked the break in pace and the mystery-feeling from the start, and how I tried to make myself try to solve the case like I was reading an Agatha Christie novel or something.Very decent guest actors make this an episode to watch unless you're all about action and space-battles.Also nice to see Gates McFadden at least trying to play an emotional role here (the episode is all about her) compared to her normally cast-bound facial expression. She doesn't quite succeed, but she's not too annoying either, so I guess it's a good episode for her.Very good for a low budget episode!",7

Only a small group of scientists bothered showing to see it and Dr. Crusher moderated this get together. However, when one member of the group dies and then another, Beverly disobeys orders in order to get to the bottom of it. Can she manage to both solve the problem AND get herself out of trouble?This is a decent show because the story is rather unique and offers some nice twists.

How did either race gain their technology or even make it this far into space without scientists?Why was Beverly Crusher, a medical doctor, researching this shield technology and not an engineer like Geordi?And in the end, why was Crusher not reprimanded for performing an autopsy against her Captain's orders? Many cultures do not believe in autopsies and she disregarded this with no consequence.And don't get me started on that fake death. UGH. Not my favorite episode, though I did enjoy Crushers roundhouse kick there.",4
10,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Suspicions (TV Episode 1993)",possibly the worst of the worst for ST:TNG MST3K could use this,"Many spoilers...First, Beverly Crusher is a MEDICAL doctor, not a theoretical physicist. That she would be following and organizing research on Metaphasic Shields is ludicrous. But let that slide. She thinks a Ferengi has developed his theory into a working shield but all the other mean scientists except a small handful won't even look at his work. So what's Beverly to do... Oh, she'll organize a mini-conference to showcase the shield. So 4 disparate world scientist come on board to see this shield in action. A scientist by definition bases their thinking on Seeing and Verifying and since this is the far future they surely are even better at this then we 21st century folks are. But even though the Ferengi has developed a working shield 2 of the four are prepared to dismiss it out of hand and the other two don't seem to have much confidence in it either.So what would scientists logically do? They would outfit a REMOTELY operated shuttle with the shield and see if it worked. They would not put one of the scientists, who's never used the field before, and who's never flown this particular shuttle before, on the shuttle simply to operate the steering wheel, brakes and accelerator. But no, they argue about who should go on what presumably half of them think is a suicide mission. Just plain stupid.Of course things go wrong and we get a Sherlock Holmes version of Beverly Crusher who's convinced it was murder, that the shield was sabotaged. And to show her high regard for Captain Picard she disobeys his direct order and performs an autopsy that goes against Ferengi Cultural norms. Meanwhile everyone acts like a shield that performed almost perfectly, except for letting some tachyons thru that killed the pilot, is a TOTAL FAILURE and the whole thing should just be abandoned. Really, you give up that easily??? Just plain stupid.But she's out to prove the shield DOES work.. yet the obvious way to prove it would be to simply test it again, this time without letting anyone near it to sabotage it. And to remotely pilot it. As we saw the first time, all the sensor readings are able to be remotely read, programing the shuttle to execute a series of automatic turns and return would be child's play.But no, this time Beverly takes the shuttle to prove it works. But the dastardly villain has snuck on board. Somehow he's escaped from the murphy bed medical chamber he's been held in, no one noticed him busting out and now he's hidden in the shuttle. And at just the right moment he springs out like a Bond Villain to confront Beverly and spill his guts about his motives and plans. Giving Beverley time to get the drop on him and phaser him in the gut.Beverly returns triumphant and Jean-Luc welcomes back one of his senior officers who has been a very bad girl disobeying him. Figurative high fives all around... Board of Inquiry cancelled.Just a really really bad episode.",1
11,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Suspicions (TV Episode 1993)",How Crusher got her job back,"Crusher looses her job while sleuthing a murder mystery. She steals a shuttle and kills a man without any witnesses in order to get it back. All is forgiven. It's refreshing to meet a Ferengi scientists. This episode gives that species much better on screen representation than we are used to and Dr. Rega really serves as a positive role model for young Ferengi everywhere. Every Ferengi who grew up watching this show usually saw their species represented as greedy and duplicitous. It's a well known fact that media representations have a powerful impact on the minds of young adults. Young Ferengi who see this episode will grow up believing they can be more than bothersome trolls. Ferengi death rituals are taken seriously in this episode too, further honoring the species. It's also refreshing to meet a Klingon scientist and a female one at that. While she is portrayed as hot headed she is only angered when her honor is questioned. The Vulcan women is a condescending shrew with a human for a pet. He's a loyal pet. The Kitarian has the ability to sever shuttle communications while hiding in a storage locker. He can also sneak in and out of the ships morgue to the science lab and the shuttle bay without being noticed. I am sure his unique physiology includes invisibility and a site to site transporter. I wonder if he gave plot exposition to Dr. Rega before he murdered him? It's a Crusher centered one-off that fails to meet the standard set by ""Remember Me"". Watchable but forgettable.",6
12,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Suspicions (TV Episode 1993)",Will Dr Crusher get the sack?,"As this episode opens we see Dr Crusher packing her bags; Guinan appears at the door asking her to look at a tennis injury but Dr Crusher informs her she is no longer the ship's doctor and is getting ready to face a board of inquiry. Guinan still asks her to treat her injury and while she does so she tells the story of how she came to be in this position.She tells of how she met a Ferengi scientist who had some revolutionary ideas about ship's shielding that if viable could allow a ship to safely fly into the corona of a star. His ideas are ridiculed but Dr Crusher things he deserves to be heard so arranges a small meeting of scientists on the Enterprise. Most of them are unconvinced but one, Dr. Jo'Bril, thinks it will work and agrees to pilot the test flight. Initially all goes well but then radiation levels suddenly rise. He manages to fly out of the star and is returned to the Enterprise but dies soon afterwards. Dr Crusher is surprised that he died but notes that his alien physiology is like nothing she has seen. Inevitably it is assumed the shields failed and when the Ferengi is found dead it is believed he committed suicide. Dr Crusher wants to perform a post-mortem but is refused due to Ferengi death rituals. Convinced that he was a victim of foul play she goes ahead anyway and that is how she finds herself in her current predicament.Having heard this story Guinan persuades her not to give up and she sets about proving that the shields failed because of an act of sabotage; if this is the case which of the other scientists did it and will she be able to prove it without killing herself in the process?.The way this episode is set up makes it interesting; we quickly learn that Beverly is facing discharge from Star Fleet but have no idea what she could have done to get herself in such a position. That mystery plays out slowly but while we are waiting to find that out further interesting mysteries arise; notably whether or not the shield failure was an accident or sabotage. This episode is very much centred on Dr Crusher and Gates McFadden carries the story well in this role. Another plus is the make-up of 'guest alien' Dr Jo'Bril; it is much better than the usual subtly different human. On the down side there are a number of flaws; it is never explained why the initial shield test must include a piloted shuttle rather than a probe and even when the case is solved there should still be the matter of the post-mortem which Dr Crusher was specifically told not to perform but this is forgotten about and she is reinstated. If one can ignore these details it is a pretty solid episode that gives us a chance to see Dr Crusher doing more than usual.",7
13,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Suspicions (TV Episode 1993)",Star Trek The Next Generation--Suspicions,"Decent little whodunit Beverly Crusher episode of Star Trek—The Next Generation dealing with a murdered Ferengi scientist with breakthrough metaphasic shield technology that could equip outer hulls of ships with shielding powerful enough to penetrate and be protected through the corona of a sun. Beverly believes this technology (while highly criticized as implausible and impossible) is legit and Dr. Reyga (Peter Marx) could be considered the scientist who perfected metaphasic subspace shielding. He's so driven and dedicated to proving its genuine that, undeterred by the unexplainable death of a fellow scientist, a Farakan named Dr. Jo'Bril, Reyga is willing to pilot the shuttlecraft himself despite the possibility that his shield isn't foolproof. When Reyga is found dead from a plasma inducer discharge which appears to be a possible (but improbable) suicide, Beverly will go to great lengths to prove he was not only murdered but his metaphasic shield was sabotaged during the first shuttlecraft run, when Jo'Bril piloted it into the corona. Along with Jo'Bril, a being Beverly had never encountered (his physiology and cellular structure bewilder her when trying to conduct an accurate and thorough autopsy), a Vulcan subspace shielding expert who had yet to get as far as Reyga (and her theoretician human husband) and a Klingon scientist (skeptical of Reyga and had argued passionately with him prior to his death) are under possible suspicion for the murder and sabotage. The mystery has an interesting twist that plays on Beverly's unfamiliarity with a certain species and learning that the desire to sabotage the metaphasic shield test run had to do with intentions to use it for a weapon. Beverly's defying a Ferengi death ritual to perform an autopsy on Reyga (no matter the good intentions regarding crediting his name and finding his murderer, interfering with the customs of other species is quite the no-no), despite Captain Picard's orders not to (and avoiding conversations with her colleagues over not getting more involved in the ""investigation"" (she conducts on her own)), gets her in hot water. She will face a tribunal, a trial, for the autopsy, but not before Beverly uses her time to get to the bottom of the mystery of Reyga's murder. It is quite an episode that allows Beverly to prove her mettle as the odds are against her. Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) has a nice part to play in Beverly's motivation towards bringing justice and renown to Reyga. It was refreshing to see a Ferengi celebrated as a genius not a greedy, self-absorbed buffoon. Reyga was even willing to give credit to any of the scientists who helped to assist him in making the metaphasic shield a real credible success. To see Beverly risk everything to see his death wasn't in vain is a great development for her character. Suspicions isn't about to bubble up to the surface of top 10 lists of Next Gen favorites but as a Crusher episode it is fun to see her in combat (and getting the better of the one trying to kill her and discredit Reyga) and sleuthing for answers when told to ""stay in her quarters and read a good book"". Gates McFadden and Whoopi have some really nice moments in this episode, too...the final scene involving tennis elbow is a hoot.",7
14,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Suspicions (TV Episode 1993)",extremely low..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 06This sixth somehow seems to have hold down the train of enthralling compartments, the concepts are still fresh and comes in with new perspective but unfortunately the storytelling isn't as engaging as the previous seasons.SuspicionsThe title Suspicions for the episode is apt for the written material since most of the time is spent upon creating spooky symptoms around the air and asking for advices or opinions from different personas either way it ends up on being a big hotchpotch of basically nothing.",

Worf listens in earnest about how a leap of faith kept Data from just thinking of himself as nothing more than a computer.

In fact, the script is good enough to hold its own were it to be used for any dramatic series, not just Star Trek.What makes the story really shine are two things- first, spectacular sets, costumes, and camera work give this Klingon oriented episode the look & feel of a feature film; one has to really watch it twice to catch all the visual delights the producers painstakingly worked into it. The wide variety and intricate detail of the Klingon costumes is particularly outstanding.Second, the excellent casting of veteran character actor Kevin Conway in the lead role; his in-depth, powerful, yet sensitive performance as Kahless is another reason why ""Rightful Heir"" has a high quality, feature film atmosphere. Conway's resume' is quite extensive but he is perhaps best known for his role as ""Sgt.

He has all the credentials as a DNA and brain analysis shows. He also has great knowledge of all the things he should. The kicker, however, is that when he engages with the head of the council, he is defeated, and Kahless would never be defeated. Now Worf, who has been taken in and defended the guy, is faced with a loss of faith. What can be done now? This man has the potential to bring the Empire into a new era, but he is really a fake.

Picard gives him a leave of absence to visit Boreth; the planet where Klingon's believe the legendary Kahless went to die and from where he will return when the Empire most needs him. A group of the most faithful pray there hoping for visions but after ten days Worf sees nothing; the head priest admonishes him for his impatience and he returns to the shrine then Kahless appears before him not as a vision but as a living, breathing Klingon! At first it is hard to believe but he knows details of Kahless's life that only the priests know and when a very sceptical Gowron arrives it is discovered that his DNA is an exact match with that found on an ancient dagger that belonged to Kahless. Can this really be Kahless back again? Gowron certainly doesn't think so.After episodes centred on Riker and Dr Crusher it is Worf's turn to take centre stage in this interesting look at Klingon mythology. The central idea that the great leader Kahless who died 1500 years ago will return in a time of need seems a clear link to Arthurian legend with Boreth acting as his Avalon. There is a difference of course; a number of Klingons actually believe he will return. Early on I was a little unsure about this story; if Kahless were to return it would be a remarkable coincidence if it happened while Worf was visiting. When we learn the truth behind his 'return' the timing makes perfect sense. Michael Dorn does a fine job portraying Worf's crisis of faith, Kevin Conway does a solid job as Kahless and Robert O'Reilly makes a welcome return as Gowron the wild-eyed Klingon leader. One would expect lots of fighting in a Klingon led episode but here it is rather lacking; apart from one impressive fight between Gowron and Kahless and some sparring between Worf and Kahless they are surprisingly restrained; certainly not the brawls we might expect. Overall though a pretty good episode.",8

The conflict between corrupt religious leaders and corrupt politicians is pretty interesting. I'm glad that sort of thing doesn't happen here on Earth. Fun fact: Worf's quarters are located on Deck 7 Section 25 Baker.",7
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Rightful Heir (TV Episode 1993)",Star Trek The Next Generation--Rightful Heir,"Another strong Klingon-themed episode of Star Trek—The Next Generation has Worf going to Boreth to practice a ""waiting ceremony"", hoping the spirit of their warrior god Kahless will return to unite the rift that exists within the Klingon people. In a crisis of faith, Worf is uncertain if his belief in Kahless remains on fertile groundthat is until Kahless ""returns"" with a ripple effect certain to bring quite the bit of controversy. Leader of the Klingon High Council, Gowren (Robert O'Reilly) doesn't believe Kahless is real, thinking he's some impostor sullying the great name of such a revered cultural icon. Worf also has his doubtsuntil Kahless' blood is tested with the blood on a knife held in a sacred place on the Klingon Homeworld, brought on board the Enterprise by Gowron. The blood, tested by Dr. Crusher, does in fact match, and Worf's faith is restoredtemporarily. When Gowron engages in a knife battle with Kahless, getting the upper hand, doubt resurfaces, and Worf has some choice words and warnings towards Kahless' entourage, politically influential Koroth and Torin (Alan Oppenheimer and Norman Snow) regarding this attempt to pull wool over the eyes of the Klingon people. This episode does reintroduce and reemphasize Worf's admirable status with the Klingons; you can go back to the early days of Star Trek—The Next Generation and recall how he wasn't looked upon as favorably by his people, if just because he wore a Starfleet uniform. But close to the end of the show's tenure, his place with the Klingon people was far more respected. That conflict that existed in Worf regarding torn loyalties between the Klingon Empire and the Federation was always a fascinating storytelling device to explore; there was plenty of room to explore his conflict considering the length of the show's run. Here, though, Worf is front and center with the Enterprise (except an exceptionally well used Data, with some words that really harvest in Worf and take root) taking a back seat regarding the developing plot. Picard encourages Worf to seek out spiritual/philosophical fulfillment, but the Captain is stern and firm in his demands for proper officer behavior when wearing the Starfleet uniform. To command respect like that, few humans could elicit such honor from a Klingon; Picard was such a human. The politics of the worsening power struggle and cultural strife shaking the foundation of the Klingon people takes precedence over most of this episode's story. Worf put aside the knowledge of the origin of this ""new"" Kahless, and how he wasn't the same warrior so idolized, in favor of his people uniting as a whole, acknowledging that through ""something to believe in"" they can find that warrior spirit so lacking. To use Worf as a means to potentially lead the way through his endorsement a new era for the Klingons gives the character further value. The show had opportunities to explore themes we can identify, like this episode's dealing with the loss of faith, and the lengths sometimes it takes in order for that lost faith to be resurrected. Worf isn't totally satisfied, but this Kahless the Klingons are left with has great wisdom; this Kahless has him contemplating the importance of what the ""last"" Kahless left behind in his legacy, teachings, and wise words, and perhaps that is what is ultimately lasting and fruitful. If you have the words of a great warrior, the kind of words that have left inspiration to centuries of Klingons, then maybe that is far more important than a return from the spiritual realm. Kevin Conway, the cult character actor, I thought does well to bring aspects of the personality so valued by Klingons to his Kahless, even approach those who challenge his standing in battle as this ancient warrior would, then later, when having to endure where he really come from (and how he's looked upon due to this), he is willing to still stand as a faux replacement, a symbol of warrior pride and honor, as well as, a restorer of faith for the people needing the proper motivation to be the best he can be.How Data is used because of his curiosity in the Klingon belief of a returning warrior from the ""other side"", as promised, with questions for Worf and the way the topics of faith and rationale are voiced in their conversations (I particularly like how Data mentions he ""took a leap of faith"" when looking at himself as a man, not just a machine of circuitry and subprocesses in addressing Worf's concerns about Kahless not being as so advertised) I think provide key moments that resonate. Rightful Heir is the kind of episode that uses the Enterprise as a place of significance in terms of how the Klingon Empire could be re-shaped.",7

On the original Star Trek this was just a group that liked to fight and kill. Worf as played by Michael Dorn is presented here and on Deep Space Nine as a model Klingon.Gene Roddenberry seems to have borrowed from the Japanese warrior tradition and samurai culture in creating the Klingons. The first several emperors were mythological beings until archaeological evidence proves otherwise. The fist Japanese emperor a guy named Jimmu Tenno came directly from the sun.They have an emperor too who was thought semi-divine. Worf on a pilgrimage to a planet thought sacred in the Klingon tradition runs into a reincarnated flesh and blood version of Kahless the first Klingon emperor of whom it was prophesied he'd return to life from the place he went to die.This is all not sitting well with the current head of the Klingon High Council Gowron.

Riker evacuated with other crew onto his previous ship, the U.S.S. Potemkin from the surface of the planet Nervala IV. Now they are back to retrieve what the Potemkin left behind - including unexpectedly another Riker! It turns out that a second Riker was created by the planet's distortion field when Riker transported off the surface. Now, this new Riker (which he names himself Thomas, Riker's middle name) must pick up where he left off and it isn't easy - especially for his former love, his ""Imzadi"" Troi.Another intriguing 6th season episode, with great performances by Jonathan Frakes as the twin Rikers and Marina Sirtis as Troi.Trivia note: Dr. Mae Jemison makes a cameo appearance as Lt. Palmer (she was the first African-American woman to travel to space, having gone into orbit aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour on Sept. 12, 1992). Also, Riker plays his beloved trombone again (and he can't get through the solo of the song ""Nightbird"" which he's saved from playing at the very last moment!). Further, we see the crew poker game again.AND, Riker tells ""himself"" about how he reconciled with ""their"" father (which Riker did during the 2nd season episode ""The Icarus Factor"").",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Second Chances (TV Episode 1993)",One of the most interesting & original episodes of any Star Trek...,"Yes, it's true, the ""duplicate"" and ""clone"" stories are pretty ubiquitous in the Star Trek Universe (the two Kirks in TOS ""The Enemy Within"", the ""alternate universe"" duplicates in TOS, ST:NG and ""Star Trek; Enterprise"", etc), but this installment presents a startling, fresh, and thought-provoking twist on this frequently re-visited concept- the ""second Riker"" isn't just a copy, clone, or evil twin, he's another original, complete with childhood memories, career goals, and romantic thoughts identical to the first Riker (at least up to 8 years ago in the story).Being exactly the same person in all respects- sharing everything in common (including Riker's legendary individualism, ambition and stubbornness), the two Rikers are forced to work together on the Enterprise and find themselves competing with each other in almost every respect (including a moving & sometimes heart-wrenching contest for the love of Deanna Troi).What a fascinating idea- imagine being forced to work with & compete with yourself! This is a great episode because it makes full use of Star Trek's wonderful imaginary technology (in this case the transporter) to present the viewer with a unique situation that could only happen here, in the Star Trek Universe.Not much action in this one (unless one includes the romantic scene(!) with Riker#2 and Deanna in the workout room but that's a different kind of action- lol), but that is more than compensated for by a well written script, excellent acting and directing, and of course a highly intriguing premise. Jonathan Frakes follows up his outstanding performance in ""Frame of Mind"" with another tour de force here in a dual role that showcases his excellent acting skills.The only negative aspect of this installment (if there is any) is that it's only an hour long- all the avenues of such an interesting concept just can't be explored fully in 60 minutes. This story could have easily made a great two-part episode or even a feature film (with a little more action added in).",8

Many years prior to the current events on the Enterprise, during a transporter malfunction, a carbon copy of Will Riker has been abandoned on the planet, trying to keep himself alive, dealing with a dying ship. What is weird is that an away team, during a narrow window (once every eight years) finds themselves aboard the ship, hoping to download the computer banks, meets this the new Riker. What is even more interesting is that our familiar Will is on the away team. The new Will (or really old one) is perfectly whole in every way. He is not a clone or a partial person. Hence, he is beamed aboard and the two of them must coexist. There is enough tension, but a previous love affair with Deanna Troi becomes another complicating factor. She has moved on while he has carried his love for her all this time. All this is really entertaining and leads to a really interest denouement. Well worth the time.",8

Now Commander Riker is part of the away team that are tasked with retrieving the data from that mission. There will only be handful of short windows to go down and do the job before it disruption field returns for another eight years. The away team is shocked to find that there is somebody in the base Lt Riker!After initial scepticism it is established that this man is indeed William T Riker; for some reason the transporter beamed one Riker back to the Potemkin and sent one back to the base. One went on to become the man we know, the other was left alone for eight years while nobody suspected anybody was there. The way this happened means that they are both the 'real' Will Riker. It is difficult for both of them to learn that they have a double and they don't get on well together. Things are further complicated by the fact that at the time of the accident Riker was dating Counsellor Troi and Lt. Riker would like to continue that relationship.This is an interesting episode that raises an interesting question; how would we feel if we met somebody who was effectively oneself. Jonathan Frakes does a great job in the double role; he nicely conveys the way each Riker feels about the situation. The scene where the two play poker, along with Data and Worf, was particularly good as it demonstrates so well their now different situations. I feared that the episode would go for the clichéd ending of killing of Lt Riker but thankfully he survived so can potentially return in a future story. The part of the story involving Troi does feel a bit tacked on and it does seem unlikely that Lt Riker wouldn't realise Troi would have moved on with her life although to be fair after eight years alone it is understandable that he'd at least hope to restart the relationship. Overall an interesting episode that explores some interesting ideas.",9

1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Timescape (TV Episode 1993)",Fascinating but nonsensical episode,"Picard, Geordi, Troi, and Data are returning from a conference via runabout when they begin to encounter bubbles of space-time distortion where time travels at varying rates. After a brief search they find the Enterprise apparently locked in combat with a Romulan warbird, with both frozen in time. Upon further investigation, they realize that The Enterprise is in the process of a warp core breach. The four members must find a way to save the ship from the doom that has already happened.This is yet another episode with an amazing premise that falls short in the execution. I love any story that involves playing around with time, and this is one of the most fascinating and creative of those such episodes. However, most time-warping ideas make no sense when you think about them, and this episode is sadly no exception.THE GOOD-The four main cast members featured in this epp all do a great job. Even Troi is useful for a change thanks to her knowledge of warbird layout and technology gained in ""The Enemy.""-The idea behind this episode is so incredibly tantalizing. The storytelling possibilities of different pockets of space passing time at different rates excite the imagination like few others.-The mystery and suspense are very well done and using the Romulans as a red herring is genius.-Love seeing the runabout on TNG. I wonder why they never use the set for the aft compartment on DS9, though. It really goes to show how much nicer runabouts are than shuttles.-Michael Dorn's performance as a statue is honestly incredible. That may sound odd, but compared to how all the other supposedly frozen actors constantly move and blink, Dorn's performance is flawless. I would 100% believe it if I learned he was actually played by a wax figure.THE BAD-The way the pockets of space time distortion are portrayed make no sense. The movements of the runabout and the characters in the first act make it impossible to reconcile them with the positions, shapes, and sizes of the supposed bubbles.-The ""time aliens"" are not explained at all. Nothing about them make sense to me. Neither is it ever explained why the warbird is firing on the Enterprise.-The ending, where they make time run backwards and then forwards again, is also nonsensical. They go well past the point of the warp core breach and yet are never engulfed, inexplicably giving Picard time to fly the runabout into the energy beam.-All the excuses given for why they can't just shut off the beam seem contrived and far-fetched. Breaking the beam would tear the ship apart? Really, Riker? Maybe I'm just bitter that they thought it was necessary to destroy a beautiful and perfectly good runabout.THE UGLY-I know it's unavoidable, but most of the actors do a very poor job of appearing ""frozen."" The worst by far is one particular Romulan on the bridge. When Picard is pulling up data on the tactical console (in complete contradiction with Data's assertion only seconds earlier that the consoles don't work, another ugly inconsistency), the Romulan in the background is swaying dramatically and even blinks. I imagine this wasn't very noticeable when broadcast on 90's TVs, but in 1080p HD it is painfully obvious.-The scene where Picard's fingernails grow to grotesque lengths within seconds is probably one of the most memorable in all of TNG, but you can see that he already has the fingernail extension props on when he walks into the room and again when he sits down at the console. Lazy, sloppy work on the part of the director.-Data repeatedly asserts that objects frozen in time can't be scanned (which makes sense, since the scanning beams would also be trapped), but then on the Enterprise and again on the Romulan ship, the crew members use their tricorders multiple times with no apparent issues.-Going off the above ""ugly,"" there are many issues that would be encountered that the writers didn't consider. For example, communication transmissions would also be dramatically slowed within the bubble, making communication impossible. Same goes for transporter beams. In fact, even light photons would be slowed to the point that everything would probably look like a red blur (or may not even be visible at all) to those in normal time. Gravity would likewise be affected.-It's interesting to note that the distortion bubbles seem to operate similarly to warp bubbles, as does the protective shield that the crew uses to operate outside the time distortions. This means that most likely a ship with an active warp field would NOT be affected by the distortions, since it is projecting a protective distortion of its own.",6

They manage to create a device that enables them to enter the 'time bubble' and beam onto the Enterprise. It looks as though a Romulan attack is underway but that isn't the most important worry; the warp core has breached and it is established that time hasn't actually stopped, it is merely moving incredibly slowly so this breach will destroy the ship and as the breach has occurred that destruction is unavoidable... or is it?This is an enjoyable episode that plays with the way time works in an interesting way. The opening set up nicely leads us to believe that the Romulans are likely to be the cause of the problems just by telling us they are in the area. This is reinforced when those in the runabout return and find Romulans on the Enterprise and in their frozen state it looks as though they are attacking. While we can guess that ultimately a solution will be found and the Enterprise saved it is intriguing to guess just how this could be achieved since the core has been breached. This breach also gives us one of the funniest and most surreal moments in all of 'Star Trek' Picard starts laughing uncontrollably and as the others turn to see why we see he has drawn a 'happy face' in the vapour coming from the breach don't worry this strange behaviour is explained.

When the runabout returns with these folks who attended the conference, they see the Enterprise and the Romulan ship in what appears to be a space battle...and they and the crew inside the ships are frozen in time!

An Away Team to the planet though discover a group of Borg that are hostile but self-aware (calling themselves ""I"" not ""we"") - at the same time Data begins to experience emotions for the first time ever (more specifically rage).Soon one of the Borg is captured while the Federation prepares for an invasion by the Borg again (lead by Vice Admiral Alynna Nechayev - played again by Natalia Nogulich). And this Borg convinces Data to yearn for more emotions and that may lead to the betrayal of his crewmates.What really is going on? What the Enterprise crew finds leads them to familiar figures from their past, with Dr. Crusher in command!Trivia note: Data plays poker on the Holodeck with Isaac Newton (played by John Neville), Albert Einstein (played again by Jim Norton whom we last saw in ""The Nth Degree""), and the real-life Stephen Hawking. Nechayev also questions what Picard did with Hugh in ""I, Borg"". Data also reveals that you need 2 senior officers to disable the Holodeck safety protocol. And, Picard mentions he was Locutus of Borg again.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent (TV Episode 1993)",Marred by poor writing,"This is really a very poorly written episode. There are gaps in logic small and large which mar an otherwise decent story.Let's start with the small stuff:o Picard is put in command of a squadron of three starships. But except for one brief mention of notifying the other two ships about a false alarm, we never see nor hear from or about the other two ships. Why did they even bother putting that in the script?o The Enterprise gets fired on by the Borg, then gets all damaged going through the space-subway-tunnel-thingy, Worf announces that the shields are down to some dangerously low level... but then a short time later, the ship is just fine, all that damage is just forgotten.o Data leaves in the shuttle, and the Enterprise is a mere minute or two behind him. After they go through the space-subway-tunnel-thingy, it takes them another couple of minutes to find the shuttle. But when they actually land on the planet, they assess that the shuttle had been sitting there for three hours. How could Data have gotten there three hours ahead of them, when they were only about 5 minutes behind him? Huh?o They find the shuttle in the middle of nowhere, cumbersomely distant from the actual building they eventually find Data and Lor in. Why on earth did they decide to park the shuttle *there* and walk all that way to the building? Huh?OK, enough with the small change, let's move on to the Big Flaw. The big, fat, ridiculous flaw. The one that really drops the episode down to stinker level: the absolutely preposterous, ridiculously contrived way that Dr. Crusher ends up in command of the Enterprise.They've traced Data to this planet, and conveniently can't scan the planet and have to go searching for Data on foot. So Picard orders down search parties. OK. But not just regular search parties, he's going to send practically *everyone* down to the planet, and leave just a skeletal crew on board. Let's say that again: in essentially a time of war, he's going to leave the flagship of the fleet with just a skeleton crew. Including virtually all the officers.But even that is not enough, he *personally* is going to go down to the planet on the search. Huh? WHY???? What's so special about him that *he* needs to be on a simple search party mission? When he's *clearly* needed on the ship? He has sent himself and at least the next four people in the chain of command down on a simple search mission, leaving him to leave in command of the Federation's flagship... the ship's *doctor*???? Double Huh???? Why didn't he just send the doctor on the search mission instead? And how is it that, for the first time ever, Riker doesn't object? Not even a little bit?And remember, it's not just his own ship he's abandoning, *he's still supposed to be in charge of the three ship squadron!* He's utterly abandoned *that* responsibility! What happens when one of those other ships calls in with something critical? What, *Crusher* is going to make a fleet-level command decision???? And all of this, this incredible risking of both his own ship and the Federation's very security is for the priority-taking reason of... locating and retrieving one lone officer???OK, let's put this in perspective. Imagine that during the gulf war, the second officer of a U.S. aircraft carrier flew off in a plane during time of war, and went and landed on an island somewhere. The carrier tracks the plane to the island, and starts sending out landing parties to the island to find this guy. Now imagine that the captain of the aircraft carrier orders *everybody* except a skeleton crew, including all the top officers, to join the landing parties looking for the second officer. And then he himself also leaves the ship to join the search, and leaves the ship's chief medical officer, with no actual command experience, in command. Which means a United States aircraft carrier is basically just floating helplessly there off the shore of the island. Can you fathom that actually happening? Can you *imagine* what the court-martial trial would be like? Do you think that that captain would ever be permitted anywhere near a naval ship ever again?And yet this is what we're supposed to swallow.Oh! And just as an extra bonus stupidity: when Picard gets to the planet and leads his four-man scouting team, one of the members is *Geordi*. Geordi. One of the highest ranking officers on the ship. Why wasn't Geordi leading his own team???? Or better, why wasn't Picard sitting on the bridge, with Beverly in Georgi's team?The answer, of course, is that a) they wanted to contrive a way for Beverly to be in command, and b) they wanted to contrive a way that when one of the search parties just happened to stumble onto Lor's hideout, that all the cool central characters would be there. Laudible aims, perhaps, but the laziest, sloppiest, poorest thinking went into achieving those aims.This really represents some kind of nadir for the series.",3
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent (TV Episode 1993)",Data and the Borg become BFFs.,"The Enterprise is attacked by surprise by the Borg. However, the type of attack and the Borg ship are very, very different from past encounters. Their ship is NOT a cube and they show more initiative, the Borg seem angry and their attack is quite different than previous Borg attacks. Could the Enterprise's recent contact with 'Hugh' end up strengthening the Borg and making them better when it comes to strategy?Another plot in this one involves Data. During the attack, he smashes a Borg attacker to bits and realizes that, for the first time, he feels emotion--anger at the attacker. Later when he tries to replicate the attack in the holodeck and review his thoughts, he realizes that he also felt another feeling...pleasure! While all of this is normal in the circumstances, Data is puzzled. And, things get REAL puzzling when Borg meets one of the Borg and they run amok together. This is a two-part episode and you'll need to watch the next one to see how all this works out in the end.I like this one mostly because of WHO is behind everything. This guy is a real jerk--and an enjoyable jerk he is!",9
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent (TV Episode 1993)",Data gets angry,"As this two part story opens Data is called away from a game of poker he is playing with holograms of three famous scientists when a distress call is received from an outpost. When they get there the away team are attacked by a group of Borg; these aren't like Borg we've seen in the past though; they appear to be individuals, refer to each other by name and make no attempt to assimilate anybody. That isn't the strangest thing about the encounter though; as Data fights off one of the Borg he feels anger followed by pleasure when the Borg dies. Back on the Enterprise he tries to come to terms with this and investigates ways to experience other emotions. With the Borg present in the area tensions are high and several Star Fleet vessels search of the Borg ship. Eventually it is intercepted by the Enterprise; some Borg beam onto the bridge but are soon forced to retreat leaving one dead and one injured behind. The injured one tells Data that they are individuals and that they will eliminate lesser lifeforms rather than assimilate them; he also talks to Data about how he might feel emotion again. Shortly afterwards Data and the Borg steal a shuttle craft and head off. The Enterprise gives chase and when the crew see Data again they are in for quite a surprise!This is a fine opening to a two part story that gives us a great season-ending cliff hanger. It is interesting to see these different, potentially more dangerous, Borg; their changes make sense as they link back to the episode 'I Borg' where a Borg, separated from the collective developed a sense of self and was given the name Hugh. In that episode Picard had to deal with the moral dilemma of whether or not he should use Hugh to infect the Borg with a virus; now he must wonder whether he made the right choice. Data has always wanted emotions so it is interesting that when he finally experiences then they are in a negative situation. Brent Spiner has always impressed in the role of Data but here he gets so show another side to the character; he does so in a way that seems entirely plausible given what we've seen before. The conclusion should leave viewers keen to see what happens next; I'm glad I won't have to wait as long as original viewers had to wait to find out! Overall a great conclusion to the penultimate season.",9
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent (TV Episode 1993)",Data Unchained,"The ending of the season with a narrative hook. Something is going on as Data experiences the emotion of anger, killing a Borg in an encounter and ""enjoying it."" Things progress when a group of Borg, acting outside the collective, board the ship. Upon a return to the planet, it is discovered that Data now is in a position of authority and his brother, Lore, is in command. The expression, ""You just don't understand,"" is used over and over. Data is fixated on experiences more emotions and Lore has him where he wants him. The sociopathic android has not the least respect for anything but his own power and this episode leaves us with our guessing what will happen to the Enterprise and how the Borg issue will play out.",8
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent (TV Episode 1993)",Deconstructing The Borg,"This episode and it's sequel have been unfairly panned as ""The Destruction of The Borg"" - In fact, this episode is a sequel to ""I, Borg"" and also ""Brothers"". It was logical to pursue the stories of a Borg named Hugh, and what had become of Lore after he swiped the emotion-ship made for Data by Dr. Soong. We just never expected the two to be intertwined in this season 6 cliffhanger and season 7 opener.But this episode has one of best teasers of Next Generation: As Data plays cards with Sir Isaac Newton (The great John Neville), Dr Albert Einstein (a totally uncredited performance and reprise by Jim Norton, he had played Einstein across from ""Broccoli"" in ""The Nth Degree""), and the great Stephen Hawking as himself, who you could tell was having so much fun, and even looked at the huge bucket of a Warp Drive after doing this ""cameo"" and stating famously ""I'm Working on That"".The Borg in these episodes must be in fact the remnants of the Cube which Hugh had returned to. As we see, it is no longer a ""Cube""- The Enterprise is confronted by a ship of huge proportions and ghastly, nightmarish design. But as we see here, it is still effective in being a threat to The Enterprise and The Federation by default. And something else - The Borg have a way to traverse galactic distances by what is called a ""Trans-warp Conduit"" - Explaining how the original Borg Cube which the Enterprise came into contact with 7,000 light-years away could show up at the Federation's Doorstep so quickly. But we also know they had been tooling around in the Romulan Neutral Zone, per season 1's ""The Neutral Zone""And so we see two things happening: The Borg are now acting more like Klingons, and they are naming themselves, and even taking vengeance for personal injury, and using battle tactics the Federation or even the Cardassians or Klingons would have used. And the second thing: Data has become angry, and when he kills a Borg with his bare hands even finds pleasure in the act of Murder.But the entire confrontation was a setup from the start, to get The Enterprise and Data in particular involved. Why? A Borg named ""Crosus"" (Brian Cousins) ignores ""Locutus"" and takes special interest in Data- And pressing a button on his arm, is able to affect Data - Apparently with Emotions.So it was no surprise to find that Lore was behind this somehow, what was Hugh Borg's involvement? Because we KNOW that he had something to do with this as well.And so as Away Teams beam down to the surface of some Borg-Infested Planet, it's ""Doctor's Orders"" as Beverly Crusher is left on the Bridge to command The Enterprise. This was one of my main interests in this episode, and also the gorgeous Ensign Taitt who shows up in the conclusion.",10
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent (TV Episode 1993)",Season Six,"One would think that a show like ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" might be running out of gas a bit at this point. This is the fourth really strong season in a row, and it would be easy for the actors to get restless or the writers to starting scraping the bottom of the idea well. Fortunately, neither of those things happen in this Sixth Season, and in fact it is rather the opposite, as I consider this season to be the best of the entire run top-to-bottom.What I really like about this Sixth Season is that each episode is so unique and the balance across the season is absolutely perfect. In other seasons of TNG, one could really sense when the writers were working under certain themes or tracts (e.g. the show really dealing with some political topics for awhile in the middle years). This season had a little bit of everything.Some of the highlights include...-The return of Reginald Barclay (Dwight Schulz), who is always a treat, this time paranoid about the transporters!
-The seemingly impossible return of old-school engineer Scotty (James Doohan) in a wonderful episode.
-Picard (Patrick Stewart) getting captured and tortured by the Cardassians, one of the best episodes in show history.
-Remember Professor Moriarty from the holodeck? He's back!
-""Tapesty"", probably my favorite single episode of the entire show. Picard, via Q (John De Lancie), gets a chance for a do-over in regards to the incident that caused him to need an artificial heart.
-The powerful acting of Jonathan Frakes in the Riker-centric ""Frame of Mind"". One of the best ""concept episodes"" the show ever produced. The same can be said for Frakes (in a dual-role) in ""Second Chances"".
-It wouldn't be Star Trek without a time-themed episode, and ""Timescape"" delivers a doozy.So, despite the fact that the season starts off with a whimper (""Time's Arrow II"" is a train wreck) and doesn't end much better (""Descent I"" isn't worthy of a finale), all the content in between is stellar. Even the episodes that may not work quite as well are at the very least entertaining, such as a take on Die Hard (""Starship Mine""), some of the crew reverting to childhood (""Rascals""), and Data and Troi hamming it up in a holodeck Wild West (""A Fistful of Datas"").Another big part of Season Six's success was a strong focus on Stewart as Picard. Not that he wasn't featured before, but he just really, really shined in a number of character-stretching roles here. He's such a key character in setting the tone for what TNG is all about that the timbre of many episodes can be made or broke by his subtle nuances.So, Season Six of ""Next Generation"" not only shows no signs of dropping off, but may actually be at the very top of its game. The acting is top-notch, the idea chest is overflowing, and there truly is ""something for everyone"" in terms of variety of episode types.",10
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent (TV Episode 1993)",Questions abound,"'Descent' is one of the many episodes I've never seen before, and I can honestly say I have no idea how this will end. The best parts are all in the first half; a charming poker game with Stephen Hawking, Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein; Borg drones that behave like individuals; and Data's surge of emotion (anger that veers towards sadism). But even with all the phaser fire and crewmembers dropping like flies, it's never as good as those opening mysteries. 6/10",6

Early in this we see Picard and several members of Starfleet deciding to block the supply of weapons from the Romulans to the Duras. The fleet is dispersed along the border and tachyon beams are used to detect the enemy ships. We see Data in his first command and an insubordinate first officer. The corker of a moment is when Sela reveals herself and Picard and co are amazed how much she looks like their late comrade, Tasha Yar. Commander Sela announces she is the daughter of Tasha Yar. When it is revealed that Tasha was aboard the Enterprise C when it was captured 24 years ago, Picard listens incredulously and Sela reveals it was him who sent her there. Guinan reveals some of the back story and Picard listens on in earnest. Plans do not change and we get to see some brilliant Data character stuff when the Romulans attempt to run the blockade by disabling the tachyon net near Data's ship. The android disobeys orders and plugs the gap and reveals the Romulan ships, much to the disgust of Sela, and surprise of Data's insubordinate first officer. Data later submits himself for disobeying orders, Picard reassures him that he acted correctly and compliments his actions. Later, Worf declines to execute Duras's son and Picard happily accepts his request to return to duty.

Riker is in command of the Excalibur and Data faces his ultimate test by commanding his own ship (butting heads with Lt. Cmdr.

Here he has a confrontation with a Romulan that looks just like Tasha Yar; the Enterprise's security officer who died several years before. It turns out that she is Tasha's daughter Sela who was born after Tasha was sent in to the past and captured by Romulans. Sela may be Tasha's daughter but her loyalties are definitely with the Romulans. As most of Picard's fleet is made up of under-crewed ships straight out of space dock he has to put Enterprise officers in command of many of the ships, this leads to conflict on one where the senior officer objects to having Data in command as he believes an android might see crew as expendable in conflict. For the duration of the episode Worf is serving with the Klingons loyal to Chancellor Gowron although he is frustrated by the fact they seem to spend as much time fighting each other as their enemy.This was a fairly exciting episode and it was good to see Denise Crosby again even if she was playing the daughter of her original character.

But his Second in Command, Timothy Carhart, does not have the confidence in Data that Picard had given.The Duras Sisters had dredged up an offspring of Duras to be a Proxy Leader of the Council, but this boy has won no battles or has earned any personal glory for himself, so Picard had rejected his claim, giving Lursa and Be'Tor just the excuse they needed to start firing Disruptors all over the place. And with the help of Sela, they appear to be kicking Gowron's Sa'Hut.On Qo'noS, Worf and Kurn drink 'Iw HIq (Bloodwine) with Mike Hagerty (Larg) and bump foreheads. In The Capital City of the Klingon Homeworld, all are warriors, equal. Kurn knows how to respect his enemy, but Worf is too worried about Stabilizers- Until Kurn smacks him in the forehead a few times. Lursa and Be'Tor watch this exchange in the shadows and make plots.This is the ultimate test for Data - And his lack of emotion makes him the best Captain to deal with Carhart's Anti-Android prejudice. It also makes him the best Captain to deal with Sela, who has decided to make him the target of her counterstrike. Data uses this against Sela in a way she could not have predicted, and she slits her own throat in the process, defeating herself and her plans for a Romulan-Klingon alliance.At least she knew when to quit. But this is not the last we will see of her, we will see her again, but not soon.I had to have the same compassion for Toral (JD Cullum) as Worf did - After all he was just a kid, being used by his Aunts - And they leave him there to suffer the punishment they deserve. Toral is only a minor irritant for Worf, who meets him again in the Gamma Quadrant in Deep Space Nine.This second half of a two-parter sets Gowron (Bobby O'Reilly) firmly on the Klingon Throne until the end of Deep Space Nine- And it shows that even as Klingons revere personal honor, they will still accept corruption in their highest levels of Government, putting up with it ""For the Good of the Empire"". It takes Ezri Dax convincing Worf of this before a change can be made- And this also happens in Deep Space Nine.But all of the groundwork for this has been set in this wonderful episode which joins Season 4 and 5 of Next Generation.",10

This birth took place when the Romulans were taken with her has a small child and decided to make her the only survivor of one of their ruthless raids. She watched as her mother was killed (interesting because she appears in the first two seasons). Sela, the daughter, felt her mother was a traitor and hardened her heart, becoming the commander of a Romulan flagship. She is determined to destroy the alliance between the Federation and the Klingons and, using cloaking devices, continues to channel weapons to the Duras led faction. Even though Picard cannot intervene, he can set up a blockade, using Tacheon beams to recognize a cloaked ship. He may not be able to go to war with the Romulans, but he can make life miserable for the Klingons who are totally dependent. Sela has to toe the line because the Romulans continually claim innocence in all their dealings (they are a lot like the Soviet Union). Twenty Federation ships are sent to the border and maintain position. Riker and LaForge are on one ship and Data request another from Picard who acquiesces. While on board his ship, the first officer becomes insubordinate and tries to resist orders at every juncture. At one point Data must threaten him with removal from the bridge. This ""racist"" or ""xenophobic"" element adds to the interest. A chess game begins between Picard and Sela who have actually had discussions on board the Enterprise. Another carefully rendered episode, leading off the new season.",9
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Redemption II (TV Episode 1991)",Data shows some initiative,"I far as I can see Data show some initiative when the Federation net was disrupted by the Romulans. If every officer and/or sergeant was squash every time he/she show any initiative in respond to changes in a combat situation, then we have no one above the rank or private/second lieutenant. The German Army and Waffen SS of World War II would not have last for six years, if their men were not allow to take advantage of a favorable combat situation or react positively to an unfavorable combat situation. The same can be said for the Israeli Army or any other army. Look at how many times Captain Kirk had to take the initiative. At his court-martial, they read off Captain Kirk's decorations including the highest award that Starfleet gave which shows his ability to react to combat situations. In the movie, Wrath of Khan, Captain Kirk explain to the female Vulcan officer how he took the initiative to change the Starfleet program so that he would win. In the end, he got a commendation for original thinking.If Captain Kirk or Commander Riker were in the same situation, they would have probably done the same thing as Commander Data would have done.",10

8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Redemption II (TV Episode 1991)",The second part and mostly satisfying conclusion to the Klingon war for succession.,"In the previous episode, the evil and honorless family of Duras has brought forth some pipsqueak to challenge for leadership of the Klingons. However, Gowron has the clear title and it's up to Picard to designate him so they can declare his succession. However, Picard is in a bad position--as the faction supporting the pretender are likely led by the Romulans who are seeking a chance to divide the Empire from the Federation. When the episode ends, Gowron is made leader--and the war for succession begins. In this war, Worf throws in his support for Gowron with the promise that his family honor will be restored. And, in the final (and really STUPID) final scene, you learn that indeed the Romulans are masterminding all this.As a result of his divided loyalties to the Empire and Federation, Worf must choose whether to follow Gowron or remain a Federation officer. Picard rightfully cannot allow the Federation to become involved in the civil war--and Worf's resignation is pretty much a given. But Picard is NOT behind doing nothing and tries to create a blockade to keep Romulan ships away from Klingon space.During his time serving aboard a Klingon ship, Worf has a real eye- opening experience watching the stupidity and wastefulness of the Klingons. They'd rather spend all their time punching each other in the face and drinking instead of creating any real strategy. This, combined with Romulan help, explains why Gowron is doing so badly in this civil war. Eventually, the Duras sisters kidnap him and propose Worf changes sides--and considering what idiots he's serving with, the offer seems pretty good!At the same time, Data, Riker and LaForge are given temporary command of ships that all are helping enforce the blockade. Data has the most trouble, as his first officer is insubordinate and I really, really wanted Data to handle it the way a Klingon officer should! And, overall, Data does an amazing job as Captain of his first ship.And, for the REALLY dumb plot, Tasha Yar's daughter, Sela, is in charge of the Romulan interventions in the civil war. Picard arranges to meet with her and they snarl and posture a lot...especially Sela. So what's to come of all these plots? And what's the final outcome of the war? Well, see the show and see all these questions answered.Normally I love Klingon episodes and there is a lot of action in this one--which I love. I also love how Worf's naiveté about his fellow Klingons is exposed. But, I hated how Denise Crosby was re-introduced into the show. It seemed incredibly contrived and silly. I just wish that the writers had instead made her character Tasha Yar interesting in the first place instead of trying to reinvent her with a bizarro Moe Howard blonde wig and a ridiculous back story.

The late Paul Winfield was truly amazing in this and the script was one of the best I've ever seen written for a television show. The crew's anxiety over the Captain's safety was well done, but the credit here goes to the two leads. Dathon's exasperation at Picard's lack of understanding was so well acted out. When Picard finally catches on, and later begins to tell Dathon a story in a limited fashion, was very touchingly written.

3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Darmok (TV Episode 1991)",Favorite NG Episode...,"While fans will no doubt pick any number of classic episodes from The Next Generation, this particular one is my all-time favorite of any of the Trek series. It just seems to sum up what the series is all about: Attempting to seek out new life and communicate with them, trying to remain peaceful with the odds not in their favor, the crew teaming up to solve a particular crisis---all well-handled in this episode.Paul Winfield in super here as an alien that can speak only in a metaphor-like language where symbolism is everything. At first perplexed and untrusting, Picard warms to this captain and even tells his own story in metaphor to the pleased captain. Also, they must team up to face-off against a Predator-like beast while the alien captain's ship thwarts any attempt by the Enterprise to rescue Picard. They want the two strangers to communicate and possibly become allies.The final moments of this episode are just heart-rending and touching and will stay with you for a long time. Season 5 is probably my favorite of the series and this episode is the best, but not the only reason why.",
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Darmok (TV Episode 1991)",A More Realistic Episode,"There are some things on TV that are worth viewing many times. For me, this is one of them. Paul Winfield plays an alien, a Tamarian, that comes from a culture whose language has evolved into metaphor. Without some sort of Rosetta Stone, for more conventional speakers, this is incomprehensible. This wouldn't be a huge problem if other alien races weren't fearful of these people. If they are seen as threatening, the ability to circumvent a confrontation is diminished. The Enterprise finds itself in this situation, not knowing if they have encountered a friendly or bellicose force. Picard and Dathon, the Tamarian commander, find themselves in survival mode on the planet, having been beamed to the planet. They begin trying to communicate and are really frustrated with one another. They are also attacked by a creature that fades from corporeality to invisibility. This creature becomes critical in the entire scope of the episode. The efforts made by the two men to aid each other and to come to some sort connection lead to one of the most interesting relationships this series ever saw. On board the Enterprise, the crew goes into war mode because they feel the Captain is in mortal danger (which is true but for different reasons). Aside from the plot itself is the language that defines the Tamarians. This is one of the most creative pieces of science fiction I've encountered (and I have read voluminously). See this if you haven't already.",10
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Darmok (TV Episode 1991)",metaphors cleverly used,"If,I translated the Spanish expression as ""This woman has never broken a plate"" would an Englishman recognise that what he would say is ""butter wouldn't melt in her mouth""? The two appear unrelated but now you know that we mean the same thing, can you see the common idea or a problem? Darmok is one of the best episodes of TNG for me, because it makes clear the point about potential problems of communications that would occur in the Star Trek Universe. In most Star Trek stories the Universal Translator allows us to follow the story but it never seems to account for the multiplicity of language even on any single planet. Klingons do speak many dialects but do all Vulcans speak Vulcan? Here, in Darmok, the idea of metaphor rather than vocabulary is brilliantly recognised as a form of communication that simply cannot be translated and furthermore it is brilliantly executed. We hear only a handful of Tamarian expressions created by the writers as a tiny fragment of what must be a vast library of Tamarian stories and myths and yet Picard is able to understand the problem and partly overcome it. It is clear what ""The River Temarc in winter"" means. The river would freeze so it must mean ""stop"" and we can see that in its right context. And ""Mirad, with sails unfurled"" Mirad is obviously a ship and what would happen when the sails were unfurled? It would leave.And it is understood what ""Sokath, his eyes open"", is meant to convey. ""He understands"", and so do we thanks to the brilliant writing.",
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Darmok (TV Episode 1991)",Stick with this one...,"One of the things that always bothered me about the Star Trek shows and many other sci-fi shows is that EVERYONE seems to speak English throughout the galaxy! Now I understand that writing new languages for each episode and putting everything in subtitles is NOT practical--but ALWAYS finding planets that speak American-style English is amazingly ludicrous. This is one of the big reasons I really appreciated ""Darmok""--an episode where the Enterprise and its fancy translation programs turn out to be rather useless, as the Tamarians and Federation WANT to establish diplomatic relations but simply cannot understand each other's languages. So, as Picard is frustrated with the lack of success in communicating, the Tamarians have a solution--and because their frame of reference is SO different, as they try to help the Federation THINKS they have kidnapped Picard and mean him harm! In addition to the great topic, I appreciated Paul Winfield's acting. I could tell it was him because of his voice, but underneath all that makeup you'd never know it was him! And, he did a great job in trying to convey such an alien life form. All in all, very well done and it features and ending that is both touching and quite sad.",9
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Darmok (TV Episode 1991)",One of the very best Next Gen episodes. Certainly one of the top five of all time including all the series.,"This episode, 'Darmok', is the ""other side"" of science fiction and Star Trek. If you are able to appreciate space exploration without phasers and photon torpedoes and universal translators, this is Star Trek at its very best. This is learning to communicate verbally on a base level using metaphor and points of reference as language... This isn't Kirk wanting to shoot first and ask questions later. This is Picard and crew having to reason it out from square one. This is what Next Gen does best. It is Star Trek the way Gene Roddenberry saw it. If you want beams of light and things disintegrating in a sparkling blaze, try the 'Doomsday Machine'. If you prefer mental gymnastics, this is more your dish... This episode is often compared to 'Arena' from the original series and yes, there are numerous similarities in structure and plot. However, the differences, development and conclusions are equally dissimilar... Watch it for yourself and just enjoy it as part of ""going boldly where no one has gone before""...",10
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Darmok (TV Episode 1991)",He said what now?,"'Darmok' is a a prime candidate for the Interpersonal Communication classroom. The grappling between two people to overcome their language barrier; perfectly encapsulated in Picard's being stranded on a distant planet with the captain of a race who speak only in metaphor. Naturally, while being attacked by a hostile creature (it's great seeing Picard's shirt getting slashed; this starts to feel eerily close to Kirk and the Gorn in 'Arena'). It's his struggle to decipher the other man's nonsensical language that gives the story its dramatic push and Stewart is perfectly at home with these scenes . . . but Paul Winfield's got the tough job of conveying emotion and intensity using nothing but proper nouns. Both are impressive actors, but this one deservedly goes to Winfield.It's easy to poke holes in this episode (like, why do the metaphors use the English language?), but it's also easy to seal them right back up: the writes have 45 minutes to set the stage and the words, and get us to the point of resolution. Considering that, the writing is top-notch, and the feelings of puzzlement, frustration and (ultimately) triumph are palpable.9/10",9
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Darmok (TV Episode 1991)",Interesting Communication Concept,"In ""Darmok,"" the Enterprise encounters a race which communicates in a manner which is difficult to decipher. Captain Picard and the alien captain go to a planet where they struggle to survive while learning how to communicate with each other.This episode introduced an interesting concept about alien communication. In the ""Star Trek"" canon, most aliens simply speak their own languages in the same manner as humans do on Earth. This episode featured a new idea about how an alien race might communicate using metaphors.Of course, the communication concept does raise a few questions. For example, the alien race in this episode communicates through metaphors; but, the race must have spoken some type of language for the story to have been told in the first place. The aliens must have communicated before the story about Darmok was originally told.The idea about alien communication was interesting and original. The episode featured an engaging story. Overall, ""Darmok"" was a fascinating episode which was well worth watching.",9
10,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Darmok (TV Episode 1991)",Deciphering a metaphorical language,This episode sees the Enterprise contacting the Tamarian; an apparently friendly race whose language appears impenetrable. The universal translator can decipher the words but the sentences make no obvious sense. As the Tamarians get frustrated by the lack of progress their captain and Picard are transported to the planet below in an attempt to force an understanding. After some early misunderstandings Picard comes to realise the Tamarian is speaking entirely in metaphors; that doesn't solve the problem though as Picard has no knowledge of the story the metaphors are taken from. When the two come under attack from a mysterious creature they start to make progress but by then it may be too late. Back on the Enterprise they have also determined that the Tamarian's language is metaphorical but make less progress with any understanding; indeed tensions raise as they try to teleport Picard back to the Enterprise to the point that it looks as if a war could start!.This is an interesting episode; the universal translator is obviously needed to avoid having confusion every time people meet new aliens but it is nice to have an episode where it doesn't work perfectly so that confusion can be explored. The idea of a 'metaphorical languages' obviously has its flaws; most notably the fact that the metaphors couldn't be created if there wasn't a conventional language to create the original narratives they are taken from that said it proved to be interesting and certainly one of the more creative ideas to be used in the series. The always excellent Patrick Stewart does a fine job expressing Picard's struggle to understand the Tamarian captain and Paul Winfield is good as that captain; their scenes together are top rate. The activities back on the ship are interesting but mainly serve to raise the tension and make it more important that Picard can come to understand at least some of the Tamarian metaphor. Overall a superior episode which is definitely worth watching.,8
11,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Darmok (TV Episode 1991)",Darmok,"Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra. The Children of Tama, the Tamarian people—whose metaphoric language has baffled those who have tried to enter peaceful talks/negotiations with them—have reached out to the Federation. Because the language barrier is so vast, the Tamarian ship's captain, Dathon (the late, great Paul Winfield, who is delightful even when we have a hard time understanding him) decides he and Captain Picard must ""join forces"" to battle a common foe on a planet both their ships are orbiting. A lifeform, that appears and reappears, basically a creature of energy, is dangerous to both men, but Dathon takes a direct beating when Riker authorizes a transport procedure (thought up by Geordi) that attempts to penetrate a particle beam field the Tamarian ship has sent into the planet's ionosphere, to block transportation of either man, and beam Picard back to the Enterprise. Will Riker and company uncover a way to successfully beam Picard on the ship without attacking the Tamarian ship who might consider it an act of war? Will the Enterprise crew have a choice? Meanwhile, can Picard and Dathon find any way to communicate with each other? That is what this episode is all about: communication. Down through the centuries, our world has had to learn ways to penetrate the cultural and language barriers that have kept people of different countries from experiencing peaceful co-existence. ""Darmok"" beautifully articulates such difficulties, but through what Picard and Dathon experience, two very different peoples/lifeforms can be successful if both sides try to listen and understand. Tragically it takes the giving of a life to reinforce the desire for possible future relations. My favorite scene has Picard telling a dying Dathon about a fable regarding Gilgamesh and Enkidu, their own battle, friendship, and fight together which included a tragic death despite their victory of the creature, the Great Bull of Heaven, at a place called Eruk. It parallels appropriately Picard and Dathon's own battle, and uses symbolism and metaphor as an effort to communicate with an alien race that base their entire language structure and way of life on those very things. Although it would never be, how cool it might have been to see Picard and Dathon battle the creature together as intended. The frustrations of not understanding what each other is saying (it is perfectly clear that both sides are trying to extend a hand of peace) is well orchestrated; it is just unfortunate it takes such extreme measures to accomplish a goal to bring peace to two different peoples. The Tamarian ship is quite a force to be reckoned with; the Enterprise is in quite a state of damage when Picard must use what he has learned to come to the rescue.",9
12,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Darmok (TV Episode 1991)",Clever Premise adds to Standard story,"I have to give credit where credit is due, the writers, Joe Menosky and Phillip Lazebnik really out did themselves. Given a rather standard story of opening communications with a new race of beings, they put on a very clever spin.Where it would be very easy to research the language, The Tamarians speak in a way that outright confuses the Enterprise crew. Instead of using typical words, they speak and express themselves by example. Meaning their entire native tongue us based on events and examples that have already occurred.To further complicate things, Captain Picard has been transported by the Tamarians (along with their captain) to the planet below. Little does Picard know that there is a deadly predator on the planet with the ability to turn invisible. While he waits for the creature to attack, Captain Dathon (Tamarian Captain), played by the late Paul Warfield, who played in Star Trek II: Wrath of Kahn, tries to communicate with Picard, who has no idea on how to understand what Dathon is saying.Back on the Enterprise, Riker is plotting a way to get Picard back. After a failed attempt to communicate with the Tamarian vessel, Riker plots away to transport Picard back. Alas, it not only fails, but occurs at the worst time. The creature has attacked, and has Captain Dathon pinned to the ground. Free of the transporter beam, Picard runs over to the fallen captain. It is too late, the Tamarian captain has suffered mortal wounds, and is dying. However, he and Picard had finally been able to communicate to each other, and they spend the night exchanging stories.Once back on the Enterprise, Picard speaks to the Tamarian vessel, and offers his condolences. At this point, Picard's name becomes part of the Tamarian language. The aliens leave, to which Riker ask of Picard ""New friends?"" Picard replies he's not sure, but at least they are not new enemies.This is a very enjoyable episode, and it offers a very interesting look at how two completely different cultures can start to build a relationship, even when in the beginning, they literally don't even speak the same language. Too bad this marked the only appearance of the Tamarians in the TNG series.",8

The two try desperately to communicate with each other.A lot of thought went into this episode and it touches on communication something we take for granted. No doubt StarFleet's universal translator was one of the great breakthroughs in history facilitating communications with
other races.What do you do if a race never developed a written language and advanced
with an oral tradition? This particular alien race speaks in metaphors that
pertain to its history, but who else can possibly understand it.It's the dilemma of Jean-Luc Picard and the alien Dathan who Paul Winfield
plays. A misinterpretation could mean war. It has in our history any number of

0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Ensign Ro (TV Episode 1991)",The Changing Face of Ensign Ro's Nose,"When I first saw this episode I assumed these ""Bajora"" were going to be just another ""Throw Away"" Alien Race - One which we'd see once then never again.I thought the same for another race of reptilian spoon-heads: The Cardassians. And I suppose if both races had not been joined cheek to jowl in this episode, we may have seen less of them if not never again. But in reality, it is not the relationship of Humans to Bajorans, or Humans to Cardassians that made great television tension, it was in fact this trinity, this Menage-a-Alien that had possibilities.We only get a Glimpse of these possibilities in this one episode, to explore the full gamut there had to be a new Trek show created for it - Ala Deep Space Nine.I suspected something was up when I saw ""The Wounded"" and a race of horribly dressed aliens with built in spoons in their skulls suddenly and magically appear in the Future History of Trek, complete with a War with the Federation that our own Miles Edward O'Brien had fought on Setlik 3. Suddenly there was an entire War History between the Federation and The Bloody Cardies.But this is our first view of The Bajora, and Ensign Ro Laren is the very first Bajoran we ever get to see, although not the first time we get to see Michelle Forbes on The Next Generation as she was in the 4th season episode ""Half a Life"" and was given some great lines to speak there as well.The Bajora were originally written as Pariah Vagabonds unwelcome in the Galaxy, living on resettlement camps in the Cardassian Sphere of Influence.What we are shown in this story, is not intended to be any fully fleshed out History of The Bajora and it was not supposed to be a complete revelation of the Politics of the Cardassian Union. It is merely a glimpse of some goings on within that sphere and due to a new Treaty the Federation has with the Cardassian Union, the federation is now ""invited"" to ""Help the Cardies"" solve one of their little problems.So as such, we get a great look at the way the Cardassians like to deal. They have their own laws and rules that they religiously adhere to, but their ethics are simply not above-board.So when Ensign Ro is dumped into Picard's lap, the Admiral (Cliff Potts) who had been suckered by The Cardassians did not know what kind of explosive this was- because Picard's Ethics go beyond simply following Federation Rules, he weighs what is right and wrong.And our Resident Bajoran Terrorist ""Orta"" (Jeff Hayenga) spells this out: ""Things are not what they appear"". Orta's group had apparently taken the credit for blowing up a Federation Colony. The only problem is, how could Orta's crappy ships even get to another star system without Warp Drive?The thing to remember here is that only a small resettlement camp is shown, not the Planet of Bajor. And Ro's ""Trunk"" is much different than Kira Neres' - Ro has an inverted 3-point star formation pointing down from between her eyebrows toward a very small section of nose ridges. All through Season 5 of TNG through season 6 and finally the one episode of Season 7 where she appears, this ""Star"" becomes smaller and her nose ridges get larger, in the episode ""Preemptive Strike"" she looks like all of the other Bajorans on Deep Space Nine.But if you really take a look at The Bajora as they are referred to here they are exactly the same as the Bajora(n)s which we meet in the first episodes of Deep Space Nine- Their values are the same, and their plight is the same, and they both want, and do not want help from the United Federation of Planets. And the UFP gets stuck in the middle of Bajor and Cardassia- As a kind of Referee. Originally Picard champions this cause, and he hands the responsibility off to ""The Sisko"" in ""Emissary"" and it takes us another 7 years to learn that it really wasn't Picard who picked The Sisko -It was The Bajoran Prophets.",10

Ros a good character, one that's got ""tough break"" written all over her, and Michelle Forbes plays her with maximum angst. And even though I've never been all that hot on either race (the Cardassians or the Bajorans), this makes for a good political allegory. Not to mention using Picard as a pawn in a deep-cover scheme to arm the rebels in this fight. There's a terrific scene in which the Captain stares down a Cardassian battle cruiser with finesse, leaning into his diplomatic reputation; and even gets the better of his manipulators.And in the end, there's Ro, left to either continue a carer in Starfleet or strike out again on her own.

She is feisty and incorrigible. She has little respect for her uniform but feels working with the Enterprise beats sitting in a prison cell.

4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Ensign Ro (TV Episode 1991)",Bajor was different...,"Having seen DS9 the picture painted of Bajor is completely different. This makes me question why they later came and took this storyline and reworked it into DS9. The ""Bajora"" as they are called have different noses. They do retain the same naming convention of last name first. Their earrings (at least Ensign Roe's) are on the wrong ear. The timeline seems to be correct, the Occupation was 41 years. They speak of the planet Bajor being occupied by the Cardassians in this episode as well, but they claim that the Bajora are an exiled race, not an enslaved one. They paint them as refugees wandering the galaxy looking for a home.Previously I believe it was mentioned that the Federation had an alliance with the Cardassians. I don't see how the Federation would tolerate that kind of tyranny in a friend, but getting to the point, the basis for DS9 is here but it's all over the place. I don't understand why they didn't just make a whole new plan up for DS9, but I can't say I mind.There is no mention of the wormhole, or the prophets.This episode is definitely a little weird to watch after DS9. Still, from a TNG perspective it is a very good episode full of lots of action and twisting plots.Trivia: Ensign Ro (Michelle Forbes) is more recently Admiral Helena Cain of the Battlestar Pegasus in the Battlestar Galatica series.

The Cardassians have been occupying Bajor for over forty years and apparently the rebels think attacking the Federation will encourage them into trying to help find a fair solution. Admiral Kennelly orders the Enterprise to find the rebel leader so they can open negotiations; to help he transfers Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran Star Fleet officer, to the Enterprise. Picard and the senior officers are not pleased with this development as Ensign Ro had to be freed from prison to take part in the mission and her reputation suggests she isn't the sort of officer to get a posting to Star Fleet's flagship. She is a loner but one person decides to be her friend whether she wants one or not; Guinan. Ro immediately proves useful as her knowledge helps them find the rebel leader although she immediately undoes the good work by helping the rebels capture Picard and his away team! It turns out her motives aren't as malicious as they appear; she has been working for Admiral Kennelly but is now conflicted.This is an interesting episode for many reasons; we have the introduction Michelle Forbes as Ensign Ro, the introduction of the Bajorans and their grievances with the Cardassians and most importantly we have a good story. Michelle Forbes does a fine job as Ro Laren; it is nice to have a character who is argumentative and troubled rather than the usual Star Fleet types. Whoopi Goldberg's performance as Guinan is impressive in a subtle way. The idea of having a Star Fleet admiral running an illegal mission within a mission is unusual as all too often Star Fleet is boringly perfect.As well as being a good story this episode is important as it introduces a situation that will form the basis for the spin off series; 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'; there are some changes between this story and that series but the groundwork is set here anybody planning to watch DS9 should certainly watch this first.",9

7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Ensign Ro (TV Episode 1991)",The debut of the always grumpy Ro Laren,"Ro Laren was a series regular for some time until she eventually went rogue in a much later episode. During her time on the show, this Bajoran ensign was often grumpy and argumentative--like many Bajorans were portrayed on the show. This was, no doubt, because Bajor had learned to become ornery because they were embroiled in a nasty war for independence from their Cardassian overlords. In many ways, these people seemed a bit like parallels to the Palestinian/Israeli or British/Irish conflicts (among others). My only complaint is that sometimes Ro's character seemed too much like Tasha Yar--too abrasive to be likable. Fortunately, despite my reservations about the character, this episode is pretty good.The show begins with the Federation and Cardassians coming up with a working relationship, of sorts. The two empires were frequently at odds with each other over the years, but they did seem in agreement that senseless terrorism needs to be eliminated. But, you ALSO need to remember that the Cardassians are a lot like the Romulans--sneaky liars. In light of all this, the Enterprise receives Ensign Laren for a temporary assignment. Her duty is to help the ship establish contact with the various factions and try to work on eliminating the terrorist attacks. But, she is quite ambivalent about this--and her ambivalence makes her a very difficult team player. Can she work through this and become a valued member of the team?

The crew devises a method of sending graviton pulses which seems to stimulate the entity. The female scientist proceeds to send massive graviton pulses which then overloads on the entity and eventually destroys it. The episode's focus was on the female scientist's guilt on leaving her son by himself when he died.

The scenes on the planet were very memorable from the first time I saw this episode when it aired on national television. But, as sometimes happens in Star Trek TNG, unfortunately there's a huge plot hole.When Doctor Mar(sp?)socialized with the crew she was seething with feelings of revenge and hatred for the crystalline entity because it killed her son on Omicron Theta where Data was built. They were aware of her drive to study the crystalline entity after his death and her motivations thereof. The captain first asks Troi if he can trust the Dr. to be impartial, and then later calls the Dr. into his ready room to avoid arguing in front of his crew. Clearly, you wouldn't need a Betazoid to figure out where that woman's obsession was. When she went to destroy the entity with her graviton pulses Deanna Troi, an empathic half-betazoid looks to Picard like a child and says "" I think something is wrong!""

The console is screaming (usually indicating something negative might be occurring), meanwhile Worf stands there off-camera useless while insubordination is occurring on the bridge. Picard and Riker, pleading/ordering her to stop - motionless, Data also pleading, completely clueless as to what to do. Worf couldn't tackle her or even better vaporize her? Deanna couldn't sense? Data couldn't crush her hand and make her tell the code? And then Data and Geordi can't beat an old lady's hastily constructed subroutine program? From a story perspective this episode was a complete failure of th crew. From a writer's perspective it was not very well thought out. I believe this occurs more often in Star Trek because they were willing to accept scripts from many different writers, and didn't pore over them very well before production.They still had control of the ship.

At Data's suggestion they hide in underground caves and only two people are lost, including Riker's date. When the Enterprise gets to the scene the colonists and away team are rescued and a team led by xenobiologist Kila Marr investigate the scene hoping to find clues about the entities actions. She has very personal reasons for studying the entity; it killed her son many years before when it was aided by Data's brother Lore. Not surprisingly because of this she is initially suspicions of Data but as she learns that he was programmed with the memories of the dead colonists, including her son, she grows closer to him. Once the entity is discovered she is shocked to discover that Picard intends to communicate with it rather than trying to destroy it!Star Fleet is famous for its keenness to avoid confrontation but the idea that one would try to communicate with a 'Destroyer of Planets' rather than destroy it seems a bit far-fetched. Picard's comment comparing the entity to a whale devouring cuttlefish was somewhat spurious we might not condemn the whale but you can bet that if the cuttlefish had intelligence they would. The way the story was written we were clearly meant to believe Kila Marr was wrong but I'm sure most viewers will agree with her views.

The lynch mob has a good point because people are dying, but then again, the fractal menace reminds me of V'Ger and even the alien probe from ""The Voyage Home"", so it's not the most vile of creatures.But this is a Moby Dick parallel, and it really comes down to the character of Dr. Kila Marr (Ellen Geer), and Geer does a good job spitting forth the hurt and seething hatred for this thing; and I think it's a nice way of readdressing the entity from episodes past and giving it some sort of closure.7/10",7

And sometimes they just botch it up horribly. This episode shows the worst side of Star Trek, when the characters become pompous, morally superior, and dumb. It kills the believability, because such people could not make it very far in even a fantasy version of our world, and certainly couldn't bear the weight of responsibility for other people's lives successfully. In this episode Captain Picard isn't a morally responsible leader, he's a farcical caricature of one. And because of that, it's just not a worthy entry into Star Trek lore.",3

As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish.

There are no communications, power failures occur all over the ship, trapping the crew in different sections.For example, Picard again must come face to face with his discomfort around children (when they are stuck in a turbolift together, with Picard seriously injured). This is also the episode that Molly is born to Miles and Keiko O'Brien with the help of Worf (since Dr. Crusher is stuck in a cargo bay with Geordi). Data (well, his head only) helps Riker get to Engineering. And, Counselor Troi must take command of the ship for the first time - and if she makes the wrong decision, everyone might perish.A great action episode, highlighting dramatic tension among the various crewmembers.Trivia note: Dr. Crusher tries to recruit Geordi into singing in front of an audience.",

The ship is rocked by what seems to be a collision with something and is damaged. Geordi and Beverly are trapped in a Cargo Bay and have to use some dangerous tactics to stay alive! Poor Picard is trapped with the three kids in the turbolift and is quite unable to cope at first. He eventually wins their friendship and trust. Riker and Data leave Ten Forward to establish control of the ship in Engineering, encountering an energy field on the way. Riker and Data's head reach Engineering. On the Bridge Troi, now in command as she carries the rank of Lieutenant Commander argues with Ensign Ro as the ship is in danger because of a problem in Engineering and Ro believes they should separate the ship, leaving the Stardrive behind. Troi stands firm and orders power be diverted to Engineering. Picard and company escape up the Turboshaft and reach a door. Riker and Data repair the problem in Engineering, much to Ro's surprise. Worf is left with a fish out of water situation and delivers Keiko's baby in one of the series funniest scenes ever.

The ship is broken, the crew is separated throughout the decks and systems go haywire left and right - it's just one crisis piled onto another. And even though there are tense moments, there are also little bits of humor here and there.It works because the characters (and their players) work well together, even outside of routine. Picard's not good with kids, but he's forced to adapt; Worf isn't a doctor, but Keiko's having that baby regardless; and Troi isn't used to a leadership role, but rank forces her to man the bridge (nice use of Ro as her aggressive adviser).

But his ankle is broken and so is the Turbolift.Riker and Data try to get down to Engineering via a maze of Jeffery's Tubes leaving Worf to play Midwife to Keiko!And Crusher and La Forge are sharing the Cargo Bay with...

As someone else has said, this is Murphy's Law in all of it's glory: Everything that can go wrong, does.Troi has a devil and an angel in her head: Miles who is sworn to obey anyone who is in command, and Ro who is an Ensign, being TRAINED for Command, and therefore the one who will present Troi with all of the hard choices. The Hard Choices a person in Command has to make in such a situation. This same scenario is given to Troi in Season 7, Episode 16 ""Thine Own Self"" - And ironically, she does not remember what The First Duty is, as it is revealed to her here like a slap in the face.Picard has to deal with these kids - And despite his fear of Children, he gets a grip on it, giving each of them a rank and some Pips off of his collar. This is the only way he knows how to do it, and it works. That, and singing ""Frere Jacques"" while dismantling a control console and using the Fibre Optic Cable as a safety line as they crawl out of the shaft and up.This is the first and only time the inside of a Turboshaft is shown, and a Turbolift from the outside.

One of them (Jay Gordon) Trained to become an Aviator and Patterson, well he vanished just like Brian Bonsall. I remember at least one contest on the back of a cereal box where the winners would have a role on ST:TNG - And I always wonder, when seeing Children in TNG, if these kids won the role that way?Needless to say after the performance these kids gave as actors and characters, they earned a tour of The Battle Bridge by Picard.",10

Troi is on the bridge and ends up having to take control. Warf is stuck with a pregnant Keiko...who's about ready to give birth! Eventually, of course, they're able to straighten things out and the day is saved.This is a cute but inconsequential episode. Cute because it was nice seeing the Captain with kids, as he's always so uncomfortable around them--but he does manage to bond with them and overcame his awkwardness.

Picard is trapped in a damaged turbo-lift with three frightened young children; he must make them his 'crew' to help them help themselves to safety. On the bridge Counsellor Troi finds herself in charge as she, Ensign Ro and Chief O'Brien must decide what to do when they learn that the warp core confinement field is failing; do the hang around trying to figure a way to get a message to those who can fix it or do they separate the saucer section and save the hundreds of people in that, the most populated, part of the ship. Riker and Data are crawling through ducts to get to engineering, Worf is helping Keiko O'Brien give birth in Ten-Forward, which has been turned into a makeshift sickbay. Finally Geordi and Dr Crusher are in a cargo bay where a plasma fire threatens to cause an explosion! All very dramatic considering it was meant to be a rest day!At first I thought this might be an embarrassing episode; Geordi practicing singing and the captain taking children on a tour of the ship wasn't a promising start thankfully once disaster struck things got interesting. Each of the groups must deal with a different problem; the variety of problems are interesting and in some cases fairly dramatic. The children trapped with Picard were believable scared rather than overly precocious meaning that they were sympathetic rather than annoying. Data's solution to one problem was both inventive and entertaining so much to that I won't post details here! Marina Sirtis does a solid job as Trio; nicely capturing her character's discomfort as she is forced into command and is forced to take a decision that could cost many lives or even lose the ship. With all the drama going on some light relief is provided by Worf acting as a midwife. Overall an entertaining episode that shows several characters acted outside their comfort zones.",8

The crew strikes some phenomenon in space that never gets explained. Then when everything goes out this episode turns into a compilation of decades of bad television plots. First Picard gets the ""Stuck in an elevator"" plot. Then ""Let's deliver a baby"" plot with Keiko and Worf. I don't even know what the heck you call the ""Deanna having control of the bridge"" scenes.. This episode is a complete and utter cheesefest. Captain Picard HATES children. Hates them. He does not have the perfect answer for them, yet in this episode he handles them like a pro granddad. It's weird and contradictory. Every so often in long running shows like these we get some filler, and here is a perfect example. No real story development. Nothing was explained. They didn't show how they got the ship back under control really, they just showed that they had averted disaster. The joke at the end about #1 made me want to vomit.

14,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Disaster (TV Episode 1991)",Missing scene,"I'm a lifelong Star Trek fan. This particular episode bugs me because there is a missing scene on the DVD which I remember seeing on TV. Either on the original airing or the reruns. I'm not sure which.But I clearly remember seeing Riker running down the Enterprise corridors with Data's head under his arm. This scene is missing on the DVD version. One minute we see Riker preparing to remove Data's head after using Data's body to insulate an arcing electrical charge blocking their path in the Jefferies tube. The next time we see them, Riker already has Data's head setting on an engineering panel. The scene in between is completely missing on the DVD and no one seems to have noticed.So this Star Trek episode is another case of disappearing scenes. I cannot understand why they cut the scene of Riker running with Data's head. It was less than 10 seconds long so no reason to cut it for time.My other issue with this episode was Ro's constant ranting that everyone was dead and they should dump the ship and leave without them. Yet, the sensors showed there were sporadic life signs after the solar filament impacts and Troi did say she could sense survivors of whom some were injured... yet they allowed Ro to continue to rant about everyone dead and dumping the ship. Quite frankly, I doubt they could have separated with such extensive damages and power loss... not to mention losing magnetic constriction on the warp core.Then there was Ro's adding power back to the engineering panel on the bridge. As an engineer myself, all that would do would be light up the buttons. It requires signals from the engineering source in order to read any data on the panel or to perform any functions using the buttons. If those panels were dark, that means they were severed from the signal source connection and sticking power on the panel would not restore the signals or functionality.Troi was completely pathetic in this episode. The children had more sense on this episode than she did in her complete stupor of what needed to be done on the bridge. She sensed people alive on the ship but was still allowing Ro to bully her around & claim everyone was dead... fortunately, finally finding the cajones to stand up to Ro at the last minute. This episode just confirmed the fact that Troi has no business being a regular presence on the bridge instead of performing her job as counselor to a ship with over 1000 people. Troi acted like no one could command the ship without her prior approval of their decisions. Rarely ever doing her REAL job of counseling patients except for a few episodes. But she certainly has time to stick her nose into everyone's personal business and pry without any restraint, then gives them her unwanted two cents. And if they fail to comply with her opinion she wants to relieve them of their job. It is like having a Soviet protocol officer breathing down your neck. Crusher is almost as bad with her opinions.I like the episode when the nannites were eating the computer core and the scientist studying the 198 year flashover between dual stars told Troi to ""Turn off her beam into his sole"". It was about time someone threw some cold water on her.Then there was the episode where she lost her powers due to a swarm of space plankton headed toward a cosmic string and she became a snappy, self consumed brat. Riker put her in her place by saying she was basically an aristocrat control freak. When you rewatch the series, keep an eye on some of the things she says. Not to mention that awful, faded purple jumpsuit. It was about time when the temporary Captain's replacement ordered her to wear a regulation uniform.It is clear that Berman and Braga have gone out of their way to destroy Roddenberry's Star Trek.While it was a great idea to focus on the crew interacting personal stories which was what made Star Trek great instead of mindless battles, it was a dumb idea to hire writers who never watched Star Trek. Writers had no business writing for Star Trek if they had never watched it. Braga had no business writing anything. Braga was the one who came up with that dumb Voyager episode where Warp 10 turned them into giant salamanders despite dozens of prior episodes on every Star Trek series where they exceeded warp 10. So this just goes to show he never bothered to watch the series despite writing for over a decade by then.It is Berman and Braga (& JJ Adams) who have destroyed Star Trek with their latest twisted movie versions. Not to mention that awful year long arc of Xindi episodes. It is clear they hate Roddenberry and are going out of their way to destroy everything he created. They waited until Majel died to completely destroy it and show their contempt. After hearing Roddenberry's youngest son doing an interview, it was clear with his Xgen attitude that we could not count on him to protect his father's beloved series either.Berman & Braga's first new version film turned the Enterprise phasers into a Star Wars sound effects toy show which included a tattooed Romulan murderous killer whose opening line on the view screen after mass murdering victims is a singsong ""helloooo"". The destruction of planet Vulcan showed us all just how much they respect Star Trek and the fans. They also forgot it did not have a moon when they destroyed Vulcan.Many of these issues are related to the interviews during the season this episode was written and the beginning of the decline they caused.

Finally, he's grown out of the grinning cherub we'd all come to despise.Ashley Judd also makes her true acting debut in this episode, as Ensign Robin Lefler (although she made a brief appearance in an earlier episode, ""Darmok""). She does a wonderful job, and it's a pity we never see her charming brainy character again.Despite a weak beginning (everyone is *so* busy getting ready for all these scientists coming aboard, yet they have time to throw a surprise party for Wesley), the episode quickly moves into intrigue and romance. Wesley and Robin are a perfect match along the geek-factor, and they develop what is probably the most believable single-episode romance in the entire Trek universe. (I know--Wesley? In a believable romance? On Star Trek? But it's true; credit Asley Judd's fine acting.) When Wesley asks Robin out for coffee, and she says ""No. I'll meet you for dinner instead."" there's not a red-blooded male watching who doesn't know exactly how Wesley feels at that moment.With their friendship established, the two begin investigating the odd behavior of the crew that's being caused by a new game that Riker brought on board from a trip to Risa. Tension builds effectively as they learn more about the game and the danger they are beginning to face.When the crew discovers that Wesley has not yet played the game, they hunt him down, and we really do worry about Wesley during the exciting chase scenes. (I know--Wesley? The character we all wanted to be chopped into Targ food? We care about him? Yes, we do; credit his budding acting skills.) The penultimate scene, when the crew forces Wesley to play the game by holding him in a chair and forcing his eyes open is chilling. Unfortunately, a last-minute Data-saves-the-day scene pops us out of our suspense and reminds us that we are watching a Trek episode after all.",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Game (TV Episode 1991)",Sometimes a Cigar is Just a Cigar,"There is a little of ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" involved in this episode. There are also some very sensual scenes, also pointed out by earlier reviewers. The plot involves the presence of a kind of video game that gains access to the brain. As one plays, he or she is absorbed into the game to the exclusion of duties. They are also absorbed into a collective mentality. The crew, not being dummies, know that Data is an interloper and they proceed to shut him down. The only ones who are aware that things are going to hell are the visiting Wesley Crusher and the beautiful Robin Lefler. They are alone aboard a ship of addicts who are trying to force them into their game. They are under the control of the commander of another ship who has plans to infect the entire sector of the galaxy. Wesley and Robin are able to interpret the medical data through brain scans. Meanwhile, Data is the key. He is the once dangerous force to the drug addled crew. The look on Picard's face when he lies to Wesley says it all. It is obvious that their fearless leader has succumbed to the attack and this really becomes frightening. A really imaginative use of the characters.",9
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Game (TV Episode 1991)","I love this episode, Ashley Judd just steals the show!","At this point Wesley has been off the show for some time now and we've only seen a blip of the beautiful Ashley Judd in the previous episode Darmok, obviously the Stage gate for this episode. Now both come back in thriving passion due to an addictive game that has seemingly taken over the rest of the crew, bottom they are the only ones who know about it in time and can stop it, but can they against the odds?What's interesting to me is that while I love the Star Trek universe as a whole, what I mostly love are very unique or confrontational battle like episodes. So while this episode is unique it hardly has much of a sub plot or battle like feel. So what filled that gap for me was Mainly Ashley Judd as she is just stunningly beautiful as she is today, but here she was in her young twenties and boy was she just as vibrant and talented back then. So the flirtatious aspect of her and Wesley through this building episode did more than carry it for me. It's amazing how much of an open face actress she was back then showing all those emotions and thoughts and you can see looking back why she was born to stardom. I mainly write reviews for movies and seldom TV shows and again while I love the Star Trek universe overall I have to say I really found this episode a gem after all this time... Maybe it's the old man in me coming out over a young, beautiful and talented Ashley, but I enjoyed it very mush. Well done...",10
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Game (TV Episode 1991)",Data is fast when he needs to be...,"... and exceptionally slow when it serves the storyline. Data is fast enough in some episodes to avoid phaser fire a couple of feet away (Season 4 - Episode 6, Legacy) but is slow enough to not protect himself from being shut down by a human. Anyway, that is not the only flaw here. Quick summary: The crew starts distributing a device that gives them pleasure but also takes over their higher brain functions to make them do the bidding of the aliens who gave them the device in the first place. Wesley, with the help of Robin is able to discover that the device has dangerous side-effects and tries to find a solution.And now the rant: Riker is on Risa and he allows an unknown person to put a headband on him with two pointed nodes aimed directly at his eyes. Considering all the stuff that has happened since Season 1, who in their right mind would be so careless especially the first officer of the flagship of a fleet that everyone is envious and jealous of. Well, Riker makes another wrong decision here and leads to this episode. That part could have been handled in a better fashion to make the whole thing more believable. How did Wesley Crusher repair data when Geordi couldn't figure out how to repair data? Not to mention that once Crusher found the small cuts in the wires, how the hell did he repair them?? And man, that stupid off switch in data ticks me off so much when it is used by the writers to move the plot along.When Wesley informs the captain about the problem, the captain is already under influence as shown a few seconds later when he grabs the device off of a table (presumably) to his right without opening any drawer or dipping into a concealed area. How did Wesley miss the device that is towards the right of the captain? Yet he somehow manages to find the tiniest of cuts in data's wires. Ashley Judd looks good. She was quite beautiful when she was young (and still is!), no doubt (and if I may indulge a little bit - she looked great in the scenes where she wore the red/pink dress) but that hardly makes this a 'good' episode. 6 stars is being a bit generous because I am biased towards TNG overall.",6
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Game (TV Episode 1991)",Wesley's back!,"Wesley's been gone a while yet returns, new haircut and all. Ashley Judd comes back for her second episode and her character initiates a romance with Wesley -- I think the actors pulled this off very naturally, nor did it feel stilted at all.What really compels me to give the episode a 10 though is Data's entry at the end. Everything seemed hopeless and I really did not know how they would get out of this one, and then Data steps in and saves the day.Overall a great episode.",10
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Game (TV Episode 1991)",An odd case where the young people are disgusted by all the adults playing videogames!,"When the show begins, you learn that Wesley is on leave from Starfleet Academy and will soon be coming to visit. As for Riker, he's doing what he ALWAYS does--trying to get his groove on with an alien lady. However, instead of doing the nasty, she slips a video game headpiece on his head and instantly Riker is addicted. In fact, he's SO addicted that he brings more of these devices aboard and soon just about everyone is playing 'the game'. So, into this weird environment arrives Wesley and he and his new girlfriend (a very young and adorable Ashley Judd) are alarmed at how much time is being used by players in this game. Additionally, Wesley examines one of these gaming devices and finds out that it is deliberately addictive. But what can these two do---just about everyone aboard is hooked and serving some new overlords!This is a cute turn--seeing two young people who don't want to play videogames and all the adults hooked! The plot is original and clever and worth seeing.",8
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Game (TV Episode 1991)",Addicted,"In the opening scenes Riker is having a good time on Risa when the woman with him introduces him to a new game where every success is rewarded to pleasurable sensations. Once back on the Enterprise he shares it with his friends and soon everybody is playing. It soon becomes clear than it is more than just harmless fun when Dr Crusher deactivates Data; the only being on board certain to be immune from the games effects. Not quite everybody is playing the game; Wesley Crusher, who is on leave from Star Fleet Academy, just wants to spend time with his mother and an attractive young engineer; Ensign Robin Lefler. As his mother and others pressure him to play the game he gets suspicious and starts to investigate how it works... will he and Robin be able to find a way to break everybody of their addiction to the game before they can spread it throughout Star Fleet.This episode was much better than I'd expected; the game itself doesn't look anything special but that is the point it isn't really a game. As it projects an image directly into the eyes of the players it stimulates the brains pleasure centres, giving an almost sexual response, as well as imputing instructions from the aliens who have their own nefarious intentions. The return of Wesley Crusher was another cause for concern although the character seems to have matured while away; Wil Wheaton does a good job portraying his characters fear as more and more of the people he trusts come under the game's influence; the scene where he is finally forced to play the game is particularly tense; I couldn't help being reminded of a famous scene in 'A Clockwork Orange'. Guest star Ashley Judd is likable as Ensign Robin Lefler; it is a pity that she only appears in this episode as she was an interesting character. The final resolution is well handled giving the impression of a defeat just before the alien plot is stopped. Overall a solid episode which was much better than I'd expected.",8
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Game (TV Episode 1991)",A Starship of pod people,"One of my favorite TNG episodes has the Enterprise becoming a captive of a 
subversive alien race which gets the Enterprise crew members addicted to a
three dimensional video game. The only ones not affected are a visiting Wesley
Crusher from Starfleet Academy and Ensign Robin Leffler.Both Wil Wheaton and Ashley Judd would have gotten a bit more romantically
involved if it weren't for the fact that they realize what is going on and spend
the entire episode both running from the familiar friends and family in the
crew and trying to figure out how to counter the addiction to the game which
allow aliens to control the minds of the crew.Wheaton and Judd remind so much of Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter running from the pod people in Invasion Of The Body Snatchers. The parallels
are too obvious to ignore.Poor Wesley Crusher can't even rely on his mother, a frightening prospect for
anyone.Great episode and great homage to Invasion Of The Body Snatchers.",8
10,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Game (TV Episode 1991)",One of the best episodes of STNG,"STNG could be very good, or mediocre and lame. You could never tell! The first couple seasons were very dry and ""politically correct"" but the show improved in the 3rd, 4th and 5th seasons.This 5th season episode (October 1991!) is one of my favorites. It's held up to repeated viewings and I just saw it yesterday evening. For one thing....years before the internet and smartphones, it predicted the obsessive mind control of gaming and devices. I have often thought about this in the years since, and would see games that ""rewarded"" players with little ""atta-boys"" and sparkly images as a ""prize"" and how studies proved these kinds of rewards ""massage"" the pleasure centers of the brain! and I'd think ""damn, Star Trek NG did an episode on this!""Mostly STNG did very little in this vein -- real sci fi, that predicts or explores social phenomena. It was mostly militaristic types of stories. This episode could almost be a stand-alone for a Twilight Zone or Black Mirror-type of show.Even better: it's Ashley Judd's as guest star! and her first professional role ever. What a coup! she is only about 22 or 23 (and looks effectively like her late teens) and she's terrific -- she just commands the screen. (How many other Trek guest stars WENT ON to have major A-list acting careers? I can't think of any!) She's beautiful, not as eye candy but a serious character and romantic interest for Wesley. (It seems implied she will be a ""regular"" but then, dropped like a hot rock -- I imagine she had far better offers than a small recurring role on STNG.) They actually give her a lot of backstory and even some attractive clothing to wear.I normally am in the ""Loathe Wesley Club"" but this is probably the only episode I can stand him in. For starters, he's been gone a while here -- a year I think -- and he's clearly matured. He has a real action part, and a real romance with a charming leading lady. He doesn't come off QUITE as obnoxiously ""genius-y"".It's almost a shame Judd could not have continued, at least for a while, as a major character. Despite many female roles, STNG never really had any one ""breakout"" female star who was memorable or iconic in any way -- like Uhura or even Seven of Nine. I think ""Robin Leffler"" could have been it, probably due to Judd's sheer star power and acting chops ... but it was never meant to be, I guess.Beyond that, enjoy this episode for some real sci fi chops -- interesting allusions to ""Invasion of the Bodysnatchers"" -- real predictive ideas! One of my favorites of this series, despite an awkward ending where everything is wrapped up much too fast and all the characters are sort of ""oh well, they took over our minds easily with a game...no big problem, huh.""",10

Sure enough, if i remember about 10:32 there is a side angle shot of the ship of the adversary that seems to be helping the crew at first. This whole episode was about the pleasure centers on the brain. A game that is better than sex that you want everyone to try out. Everyone is pushing the others to use. NOW are you ready for that time stamp again? You will need to watch as the ship travels from right to left screen. ITS A PENIS!!! Yep, head and all. LMAO! You need to check it out yourself. I know that artists have done this with""the little mermaid"" and some other movies there its animation. This is the first time I have seen it unintentional for a TV series that was a serious show.

12,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Game (TV Episode 1991)","Not the worst, but not that good.","This episode is, frankly, weird. Ashley Judd's guest appearance and the reappearance of Wesley partially make up for what is obviously a narrative solely about gaming addiction. Why Troi doesn't immediately realize that Riker is addicted to the game and alerts Dr. Crusher before anyone else can be affected simply doesn't make sense. The fact that the kids are left to find a solution is also, equally, dumb.",4
13,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Game (TV Episode 1991)",Awkward balance of serious and creepy,"'The Game' has good intentions - mind control, that time-honored trope of scifi - and it's even served up as a classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers tale (how can you go wrong with paranoia?). But there's an inherent silliness to the execution of the game itself that's dissonant with the rest of it. It's easy to suggest brain-washing if the device is tapping into the frontal lobe, but do they really need the implied orgasmic satisfaction? That just makes it all very weird.But if you can get past that, this is a good vehicle for Wesley to save the day . . . and kiss Ashley Judd, which is an undeniable win. I don't actively oppose this episode, and there are some positives (like Crusher getting the upper hand on everyone else), but it's such an oddball game to (very nearly zombify the crew of Starfleet's flagship.6/10",6

And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it.

It also occurred at the time of Gene Roddenberry's death (he died in October 1991.It concerns Spock (played by Leonard Nimoy), now an ambassador, who has seemingly defected over to the Romulan side.

Picard pays a visit to Spock's dying father before arranging to borrow a cloaked Klingon Vessel to take himself and Data, both suitably disguised to Romulus. While Picard and Data are away Riker takes the Enterprise to a Federation facility where old ships are stored to investigate who part of a stored Vulcan ship had appeared in a destroyed Ferengi vessel. Here they learn that ship is missing and somebody is still stealing equipment.The highlight of this episode is the appearance of Leonard Nimoy as Spock; even though he only appears in the episode's final scene it is a treat to fans of the original series who will be looking forward to seeing more of him in the second part of the story. Of course it takes more than a classic guest star to make a good episode and this episode has what it takes; the original revelation that Spock might have defected grabs the viewers' attention and the fast moving events keep it held till the end. The scene between Patrick Stewart and Mark Lenard, as Picard and Spock's father Sarek, was touching as the elderly Vulcan becomes emotional as he talks about his son. References are made to this season's opening episode when we learn that Gowron has been rewriting history about his recent past and isn't too pleased to have Picard turn up however a few nicely veiled threats get Picard the ship he wants.

There is an underground movement on the planet and after rooting out this group, find that Spock is with them in a leadership position. He is hoping to bring about change on Romulus toward peace and is willing to take great risks to do this. The tension in the episode has to do with the fact that one never knows who his enemies are.

2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Unification II (TV Episode 1991)",Can any Romulans be trusted?,"After a brief recap this episode starts where the last finished with Picard meeting Spock; the former is somewhat surprised to be told that he should leave Spock to get on with his unauthorised mission. That mission, as the episode title suggests, is the reunification of the Romulan and Vulcan peoples. He has managed to make contact with a young Proconsul who claims to support reunification but Picard advises that this man has been promoted surprisingly fast so might not be trustworthy. Back on the Enterprise Riker is following the trail of the stolen Vulcan ship.This was a good conclusion to this two part story; early conversations lead us to wonder which if any Romulans can be trusted and as the story progresses we learn that not only are some trying to stop the sort of unification Spock is working for; they wish to use his work as a cover to invade Vulcan! This plot sees a return of Sela, daughter of Tasha Yar to my mind Sala is a potentially more interesting character than her mother; Denise Crosby does a good job in the role. Not surprisingly it is Leonard Nimoy's appearance as Spock that steals the show; he puts in a fine performance as this iconic character. The appearance of Spock leads to an interesting philosophical discussion with Data; the Vulcan who aims to suppress all emotion and the emotionless android who strives to be more human. While this is primarily a dramatic episode there is some humour; seeing Worf singing Klingon opera in a bar was particularly entertaining although I'm pleased he didn't sing for long! The conclusion to the story is satisfying; plots are thwarted and there are signs of hope that young Romulans want a better relationship with the Federation but for the time being the Romulans remain interesting antagonists.",8

He is on Romulus leading a group of peace-seeking rebels. He has been joined by Data and Picard. Spock wishes to play by the rules, but Sera (the daughter of Tasha Yar and a Romulan commander, played by Denise Crosby) has other ideas. Instead of a peace mission going to Vulcan, the Romulans have loaded three ships with warriors to attack Vulcan and start a conflict. To make this a surprise attack they are going to force Spock to make a statement that the Romulans are heading for Vulcan to arrange a peace agreement. Sera tries all she can to force this, but Spock will have none of it, and they are forced to use a hologram. The crew uses great ingenuity from here on. The great stoic Spock hadn't aged so much at this time. Today, Leonard Nimoy seems so old and his voice has betrayed him. There is an incident where we see just how awful the Romulans are (I said in a previous review that they are much like the Soviet Union). Certainly a worthy episode.",8

But I've always felt this episode was a bit of a letdown. Sela is kind of a silly character. Given the timeline of the events that led to her birth, she can't be much older than 20. That's pretty young to have such a prominent position in the Romulan military. And her plan to invade Vulcan seems pretty half baked. Two thousand troops isn't enough to occupy a single large city, let alone a whole planet with millions of inhabitants.There are some nice scenes between Spock, Data and Picard. But all of the stuff with Riker and the alien lounge singer is just goofy. And that final shot of Picard awkwardly grinning through a mind meld is odd, too.Overall it's not a terrible episode.

After all, the way they re-inserted Denise Crosby into the show seemed incredibly contrived and her new character was about as one-dimensional has her old Tasha Yar. She really deserved better than this.As for the episode, it's the second of two episodes and once again it finds Picard and Data on Romulus in disguise as Romulans. They're trying to figure out if the peace overtures some Romulans have made towards Spock are real or yet another plot to harm the Federation.

The computer on that ship would be far better than anything the Enterprise had so there'd be far more capacity in a far smaller space.3) Select an adventure of theirs that worked out OK but had no record of you being involved since that was a different time-line, and decide to get involved so you can steal technology that is more relevant to where you came from than the stuff you stole already. After all, there must be a reason that the ship you stole can't provide schematics on building items from the past (or just replicate them) like if they were banned when peace broke out everywhere.4) Study up enough on All Things Enterprise so that it'd seem like you were looking back at the crew from the future, and when ready, go to that time. This lets you know things like how Data is an android.5) Screw up badly enough to lose your ship, but not enough to screw up what the Enterprise crew was supposed to do. Lack of a future report from this time-line, detailing how you screwed up, ends up being a bad deal for you.6) While sitting in whatever prison-like structure you end up in, think about yourself in another time-line, reading (if you are lucky enough to hit the related time-line) passages about your failure from the newly-created time-line's distant future and deciding that perhaps another adventure would be better to meddle in...",9

And he says he's a future historian from the late 26th century!As the crew struggles to save the planet, Picard and crew are skeptical about Rasmussen's claim that he's from the future. And of course things are never what they seem in Star Trek!Trivia note: Rasmussen notes that Data is the ""Model T"" of androids, with Data correcting him that he's actually the ""Model A"" since he was built second after Lore!

He butters up the crew and tells them that he's here to see THE Enterprise --the one that is such importance to the history of the Federation. The Captain seems to accept this very readily and allows the guy to stay aboard and observe this mission. He also allows the guy to administer questionnaires to the crew and ask them questions. Unfortunately, changing the planet's climate is not easy--and the Captain is worried he'll destroy it in the process. And, unfortunately, this researcher is NOT exactly who he claims to be.Matt Frewer was a good choice to play the time traveler, as he has had a long history of playing goofy characters---and this one is rather goofy.

3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" A Matter of Time (TV Episode 1991)",One of the weaker episodes,"Read this if you already have the synopsis of the episode or better still just watched it. This is my opinion on this particular episode.Why on Earth would the Rassmussen character go through all the bother of pretending to worship historical figures and pretend to know the outcome of the current dilemma when all he wanted were some future technology ""relics"" that they seemed happy to give him anyway?Why wouldn't he simply ask straight away for examples of 'antique' technology and get the hell out of there, instead of stealing things while doing his annoying act of pretending to know all future events?The writing is terrible simply because the protagonist in the episode makes decisions no logical person could possibly make. A clever thief would have limited his contact with the crew, requested 'antiques' and left.Weak, weak, weak!",1
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" A Matter of Time (TV Episode 1991)",Entertaining with flaws,"This was an entertaining episode, but I did have some issues with it.I think Picard was way too welcoming of the time traveler. He allowed him too much access without knowing for sure if he was who he said he was. Also he asked the crew to ""extend him every courtesy"", even though the time traveler's condescending, demanding, in-courteous attitude, made him undeserving of any courtesy. Seeing this run rough-shod over the crew without much resistance took some of the enjoyment away from this episode.Another issue I had was Picard's decision to risk the entire population of the planet (in the many millions), to save the lives of thousands. Unless the odds of destroying the planet were astronomically low (which I don't think they mentioned one way or another), I think this is a bad decision. How can you risk the lives of so many to save so few? If the planet ended being destroyed imagine the guilt Picard would have lived with. I think the planet should have ended up being destroyed which would have exposed what a terrible decision Picard made. But maybe that should be a theme for a different episode.Overall, this episode was about this character who was condescending and obnoxious to the crew, and as the viewer, you couldn't wait to see him get his comeuppance. His comeuppance finally came with a very satisfying line by Data who was held captive in the time traveler's shuttle (until it was realized that stolen phaser he had been threatening Data with had been deactivated): ""I believe the door to your shuttle can be opened from your fingerprints whether you are conscious or not"".",6
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" A Matter of Time (TV Episode 1991)",timeline inconsistency,"As far as I know this is one of the first episodes written by Rick Berman himself. With all the mistakes you think he would have known better. It is after the death of Gene Roddenberry that Berman is now at the helm of Star Trek, and there are some obvious growing pains.When the time traveller historian known as Rasmussen(Max Headroom/Lawnmower Man 2) claims to be from the 26th century( That's 2500-ish) he creates a plot hole. The Star Trek Timeline which was established off of an episode in the 2nd season I believe should put us circa 2367-9. somewhere in there. He claims to have come back nearly 300 years, yet the maximum would be 230 years which is nowhere near 300 years. Apparently math in the distant future is shaky.I realize that back when this was aired there was less common knowledge about volcanism, asteroids, and global warming, but when the Captain has to ask Geordi why volcanic eruptions are bad on Panthera IV it's taking it a little far. Picard should know a hell of a lot more than that about the situation. He does spend his time mapping class M planets after all. How they save the planet is all theoretical and based on technology that doesn't exist(yet) so I cannot say whether that would work or not, but it seems like the work of a terraformer, not a flagship.Furthermore even the slightest change in the past can have the colossal impact on the future. Say Beverly needed that Neural Stimulator in a coming injury, and because she had to have another replicated someone influential dies prematurely. The best course of action for time travelers is to never travel in time in the first place. It's just too risky - they would not, could not interact with such a person or accept them with open arms. Death is the only option.When Rasmussen takes Data into his ship there is a major problem here. Why would the captain allow him to enter a vessel he doesn't fully understand. He would lose control of the situation. They would escort Rasmussen to the brig or some sort of quarters and strip search him with the aid of a tricorder. While inside, rambling on about his plans like any cliché villain he supposedly holds Data under guard of a phazer yet he takes his thumb off the trigger several times, looks away, messes with his ship...all ample opportunities for an android to move with inhuman speed and disarm/disable the guy. The way they disable the devices was a little too convenient.Besides, if he WAS from the past how could he have known ANYTHING about Picard or the crew such as their names or anything at all? Or even that Data was an android? In the 21st century there was no warp coil as they knew it. 2063 is the year Cochrane made his first flight in the Phoenix and made first contact with the Vulcans. In the rest of the 21st century nothing more than a warp probe is launched. In fact during half of this century Earth is wracked in World War III and nuclear winter. Soldiers were addicted to enhancement drugs as is detailed the first time the crew encountered Q, it was a barbaric time. There was no way to tell what the future held. There was no way he could have conducted any sort of travel in space without knowledge of it, no would there be any reason for him to suddenly appear light years from the surface of earth in dead space 300 km from the Starfleet Flagship either. Wouldn't he just be in the future on Earth? A simple quiz about the 22nd century would have proved this guy a fake in 5 seconds. Name 10 alien races that were known in this century. GO. How about questions about the Enterprise. What is the fastest warp factor we can achieve safely, GO! No answer? Shoot him! What if because he never made it back to his time he didn't invent the things that could have theoretically resulted in the invention of starships and therefore damaged the present? What happens to the time machine when it goes back in time, adrift, a derelict for any to find and wreak havoc with.Since there was no record of his existence why didn't they just vaporize him or blow him out of an airlock just for fun? Lock him in a holodeck medieval torture program indefinitely.This whole episode is utter trash that should have never been put into production. It's just another filler episode on the way to bigger better things. There are simply too many of these filler episodes. Rick Berman needs to stick to production because as a writer he is a noob. I realize that at this point he is all alone, and new at it, but he should have planned for Gene's eventual departure at his advanced age long before this. They should have had the entire series written by this point like we do today. Sometimes it feels like the seat-of-the-pants, fly-by-night kind of pulp fiction writings detailed in a certain episode of DS9. :)One more thing ILM makes me mad. The atmosphere of most planets is over 600 miles above the surface granted re-entry isn't noticeable until around 75 miles, the atmosphere is still there! The Enterprise according to ILM just sits right next to solid spheroid planets devoid of topography or water half the time, mere dozens of miles above the surface, and yet denies the natural orbit that is stable and easy to achieve around 250 miles above a planet of Earth's size. The Bussard Ramscoop collectors do collect Deuterium fuel for free at warp speeds, but you would tend to want to save wherever possible. It's called efficiency.

Picard accepts his claim and allows him to talk to the crew and give the crew questionnaires to fill in. He is fascinated with everything he sees; commenting on things that were of particular historical interest. While he is very keen to ask questions he refuses to answer any claiming any knowledge of the future could change it. Counsellor Troi senses that he is hiding something more though. Meanwhile attempts to solve the problem on Penthara IV go seriously wrong threatening the lives of thousands; Geordi offers a solution but calculations must be precise or it could cause a calamity that would kill all twenty million people on the planet; a real dilemma for Picard! He asks Rasmussen what history says he did and what the result was but he refuses to answer claiming that to do so could change the history of his time.This episode has some interesting ideas but it also features a really annoying guest character. Rasmussen is overly extrovert; gushing over every detail he sees and Picard is shockingly accepting of Rasmussen's story even claiming that his credentials check out even though a person from the future can have no credentials! The drama on the planet leads to the usual talk about the moral questions that would arise if one could go back in time and prevent something bad happening we even have that awfully cliché question about whether one would stop Hitler's actions given the opportunity. The twist at the end is quite fun if a little far-fetched much like the episode as a whole if you can get past the plot holes and aren't too irritated by Rasmussen.,7

At no time does he consider the young lad's experience of losing his mother (and his father). Worf is too proud to accept help, seeing himself as a failure for not being the perfect father.

Unfortunately, Worf is about as qualified to parent as he would be teaching ballet--and he has no end of trouble with the child. Mostly it's because the boy has never felt wanted and is a burden to everyone--and Worf never makes this easier because of his own difficulty with emotions (other than anger) and tenderness. Together, they work on it...and by the end there is a glimmer of hope that things will work out for the better.I never was thrilled with Alexander on the show simply because the kid went from an infant to a 6 year-old almost instantly.

The Enterprise has been invited to observe the test and inevitably something goes wrong; the test ship explodes and the wave increases in magnitude as it heads towards the destination planet; it grows to powerful to dissipate as planned and could destroy the planet if the crew of the Enterprise doesn't come up with a plan.In a second plot strand Worf's son Alexander comes aboard the Enterprise; Worf's human adoptive parents had been raising him but found him too difficult and thought he needed to be with his father. He quickly becomes a problem for Worf after he is caught stealing a toy at school then lies about it. Worf gives him a lecture about Klingon honour and he promises to behave. He is soon misbehaving again and Worf considers sending him to a strict Klingon school. He is told to stay in Worf's quarters but goes out and is put in danger when the Enterprise is getting into position to destroy the deadly wave.This episode was somewhat disappointing; the story involving the new propulsion system was fairly light and was mainly there to create a danger at the end of the episode. The story involving Worf and his son is clearly what this episode is really about and unfortunately it is just too soapy. Child characters in 'Star Trek' have a habit of being more annoying than sympathetic and Alexander is no exception. It also raises the question as to why there are any children living on the ship given how often they are sent on dangerous missions; a question nobody on board even seems to consider!

Data and the boy are quite humorous when they match each other's quirks, but this only goes a bit of the way. The episode depends too much on a tight little ending that is just too pat.",6
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Hero Worship (TV Episode 1992)",Counselor Troi's weird methods,"This is nowhere near the worst episode, nor the best. A ship is adrift in space and while the crew figures out what happened as the Enterprise faces the same fate, the lone survivor, a young boy, deals with his loss by ""becoming a robot.""The BoyAs far as child actors go (they're usually annoying on the show) the kid here isn't half bad. He portrays fear and guilt very well. He did not bother me. He acted the robot parts out with a stiffness that's more bad acting than robotic but for this one episode he was okay.DataData has many episodes about finding a companion, making him feel less alone. Brent Spiner is always a fine actor, and he does okay with this mediocre episode. Still, at no point do I fell Data really bonds with the kid. Sure he likes him, Data likes everybody. But a real bond I wouldn't call it.Ahhhh TroiLeave it to Counselor Troi to not only skirt her responsibility as a therapist, leaving it to the least qualified person on board, but actually applauds the child ditching his humanity. Any decent psychologist would snap him out of it before it becomes irreversible; they would confront him with his feelings and discuss his emotions; they would encourage him to interact with other kids his age. They would realize a swift intervention would be preferable, especially with the ship at risk, rather than let the alienation become deeply rooted. Troi does the opposite. Handing an emotionally distressed boy to an emotionally challenged android; seems happy that he no longer answers basic questions normally; and looks on coldly as the boy loses touch with fellow classmates. The only reason this all works is because TNG NEVER allows Troi to be wrong and to show us that she's fallible, as a real person would be. Her human side deeply fails her here, her Betazoid powers falter yet again when they are most needed, and when someone (I think Picard) reasonably asks whether this escapism should be allowed as it seems unhealthy Troi asserts herself without any arguments or proof to back her up that is perfectly normal for a PTSD human to ignore his humanity and embrace an emotionless alter ego.Troi as a characterIt says something about how much I like TNG that I also like Troi despite her many bad points. Here she shows a few of them. I like her the most out of TNG women (but not if you count K'Ehleyr) but she is sometimes very annoying.Most of the time she hunts down unwilling patients in the corridors; she scans people without asking permission; she will publicly embarrass fellow officers rather than respect their privacy (check out ""Loud as a Whisper"", where she forces Worf into confessing something and Picard, as usual, appreciates Troi's blunt mental invasion). Whenever she loses her ability she becomes a cold, uneasy woman no-one really likes. This implies that without having the upper hand because she senses what others can't, she isn't a social or warm person. She's also the worst bridge officer since sliced bread and only passes the test by forcing Riker to give the clue she needs, and only after failing 3 times.Apart from this she either fails at sensing something, shaking her head looking hopeless, or states the obvious. Check out the pilot episode ending, where the entire bridge crew looks on in transfixed marvel and wonder as space jellyfish (yes I said it) emerge and Troi out of nowhere yells ""Sir!"" distracting everybody, ruining the moment, and then saying ""...wonderful"". Come on, we don't need that. I bet everyone was mad at her.ConclusionHero Worship is not a bad episode but the A plot feels like the B plot and therefore you don't get invested in one and forget the other. When we finally see the solution to the ship's problem I had utterly forgotten it had one to begin with. Troi allows a boy to flee his emotions in the least healthy way and by some miracle the boy isn't scarred for life. It's another Data-deals-with-a-pseudo- android-episode and not the best. The boy actor is okay but not great, Data (and Spiner) seem a little lost, Troi shows herself to be a bad counselor, and the ship is in peril part slips so far in the background you tend to forget it. It's a watch once episode. Not bad, far from great, 5/10",5
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Hero Worship (TV Episode 1992)",Data daddy.,"There is some sort of huge black cloud in space (and I HATE episodes involving clouds as they are a DULL enemy indeed). Somehow a Federation ship was destroyed in it and they find a lone survivor--a child named Timothy. However, the kid is naturally traumatized and the kid cannot talk about what happened in order to help them understand what happened. In fact, the boy has adopted an interesting coping mechanism--he's decided to be an android like Data, as Data does not experience pain. So, to avoid the pain of his parents' death, the boy lives in denial and spends a lot of time with Data. Can they eventually learn what destroyed the ship so that the Enterprise, too, doesn't suffer the same fate?It's kind of cute seeing the boy interacting with Data--and Data acting like a surrogate dad. But, the whole cloud thing is pretty dull and the overall episode is middle of the road at best.",6
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Hero Worship (TV Episode 1992)",Data the role model,"The federation research ship Vigo disappeared while investigating a strange dark cluster so the Enterprise is sent to find out what happened. When they find the Vigo it is badly damaged and everybody is dead apart from a young boy. The boy, named Timothy, is only saved because Data's superior strength enables him to lift the heavy beam that is pinning down Timothy. Back on the Enterprise Timothy explains they were attacked by unknown assailants armed with phaser rifles leading to the assumption that a cloaked ship must have been involved and that suggests the attackers were Klingon, Romulan or possibly even the mysterious Breen but none has an obvious motive for such an attack. As the Enterprise searches for the attacking ship Data tries to help Timothy cope and the boy comes to see Data as a role model; as an android he is stronger, smarter and isn't encumbered by human emotions. He then decides that he too will be an android and starts mimicking Data's behaviour and speech patterns. Counsellor Troi suggests that for the time being it might be good to accept this coping mechanism. When the Enterprise enters the dark cluster they start seeing strange sensor echoes and then hit a wave that rocks the ship soon things get worse in ways that mirror what happened on the Vigo; Timothy will have to remember exactly what happened if the Enterprise is to avoid the same fate.This is the second in a row to feature a child character in a major role; thankfully Timothy is far less annoying that Worf's son. Joshua Harris does a good job in the role; he is particularly impressive as he mimics Data's speech patterns and various physical tics, as one might expect Brent Spiner also puts in a fine performance as Data. The idea of how a child might deal with tragedy is covered in an interesting way but the threat is ultimately a bit weak perhaps I was just disappointed that we didn't get an appearance from the Breem!

Though the leader, Tarmin, offers to probe the crew's distant and long-forgotten memories to help them remember, most are reluctant to try.However, Tarmin's son, Jev, violates Counselor Troi's mind and she lapses into a coma. Soon, when they start questioning the cause, Riker falls into a coma too.Can Picard and crew figure out what's going on? An intriguing episode, in the true essence of Star Trek.Trivia note: Doug Wert marks his return as Lt. Cmdr. Jack R. Crusher, Dr. Crusher's late husband (she recalls seeing his dead body which Picard - with hair! - showed her) - he was last seen in the fourth season episode ""Family"". Also Rosalind Chao stars again as Keiko O'Brien. And Troi's love for chocolate is again seen here - this time ordering a hot chocolate drink. She also recalls sharing a romantic meeting with Riker, her ""Imzadi"", but soon it turns into Jev calling her ""Imzadi"" forcing himself on her (this is like in Star Trek: Nemesis when she was violated again by The Reman Viceroy).Furthermore, Rikeris by Troi's side when she is in a coma, recalling how she helped him when he was hurt (this was in the 2nd season closer ""Shades Of Gray"") and he wants to return the favor.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Violations (TV Episode 1992)",A disturbing episode that won't be suitable for all viewers,"The Enterprise is transporting a group of three Ullians; a species of telepaths who use their abilities to investigate old memories as historical research. They demonstrate this by helping Keiko recall a cherished childhood memory that she had forgotten. Other crew members are less keen to come forward to be probed. Later that evening, as she is getting ready for bed, Troi suddenly has a vision of Riker, at first it is romantic and enjoyable but then he starts forcing himself on her; we then see him as Jev, one of the Ullians. Troi is found in a coma. Dr Crusher can't find and reason for her condition; the only medical reason she can think of has other symptoms that Troi isn't showing. The possibility of Ullian involvement is considered but there is no concrete evidence and they explain that while it is possible to enter somebody's thoughts uninvited it is such a serious crime that it hasn't been recorded in centuries. The next night Riker has a similar experience; this time reliving an event where a crew member died due to his orders. He too ends up in a coma. As the investigation continues it becomes apparent that there were similar events on planets previously visited by the Ullians. By now Troi has awakened but has no memories of the events; she consents to a telepathic probe from Jev's father but as she relives the memory she sees the father not the son attacking her.This is possibly the most disturbing episode of any Star Trek series; we have seen plenty of characters die and the crew put in countless dangerous situations but here a crew member is effectively raped. Not only that; because it is telepathic rather than physical she pictures somebody she cares about doing it even though he is entirely innocent. One has to wonder why there are no Federation laws against unauthorised mental probing let alone mental assault given that telepathic species aren't unknown; we are told that the Ullians have severe punishments for the offence but we aren't told what will actually happen to the offender. The story itself is gripping even though there is little doubt about who the attacker was; in fact it was so obvious I initially thought it must be misdirection! The acting was good throughout; Marina Sirtis, in particular, did a fine job looking genuinely disturbed as 'Riker' attacks her. Overall this was a solid episode although the subject matter means it isn't really suitable for younger viewers which is a bit of a problem in a series like this which is usually good entertainment for all the family.",7

Others might find the tackling of this issue objectionable for their own reasons, but I personally found it very well done. Even the flashback sequences are designed to keep the episode within a PG rating, dream like and psychological, not Hitchcock. Also, having both male and female victims brings in awareness that anyone could be a victim of assault.",7

Perhaps the writers thought they could compete with Hitchcock (they can't), but with no dramatic resolutions to the story, the episode even ""violates"" the basic genre of English writing. There is no sense of what happens to the mind rapist after he has been found out. Then there is the pathetic description in this script of a weak and enabling Captain Picard who can't even make a basic decision to do anything at all about the obvious. No accountability is described, no dramatic resolution, no responsibility,and not even some basic skill among the crew as this psychopath marauder goes about his ""rapes.""

Oddly, during their time on the ship, various crew members fall into comas--and they undergo extremely vivid and traumatic brain probings. In one of these, Troi is 'mind raped'. Can the crew figure out exactly what's happening?This episode is one I would caution people about watching. If you've been a victim of sexual assault, seeing the rape sequence could easily be very traumatic--perhaps too traumatic. And, even if you were never a victim, the show is supposed to be entertaining-- and what the heck is entertaining about this?! Because of this, it all seems a bit exploitative and unsavory.

In this episode a trio of aliens comes to probe the minds of Enterprise crew members for historical purposes. A database is being put together by these figures. Keiko is led through a childhood memory, leading to some wonderful experiences. The youngest member of the trio, a leering guy, seems conflicted with his know-it-all father. Shortly after they've finished their session, he walks Troi back to her quarters. After he departs, she begins to experience what seems to be a rape, which culminates in her lapsing into a coma. She sees the face of Riker over her and that transforms into the son, Jev. These comas attack Riker and Crusher after Deanna, each experiencing a scene of intense violence where they seem to be at fault. The captain suspects that their guests have something to do with this, but he must also be diplomatic since there has been no ""physical"" presence, only in minds of the victims.

8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Violations (TV Episode 1992)",I hold Star Trek to a much higher standard than this,"I grew up on Star Trek: The Next Generation. Recently I decided to sit down and watch the entire series from start to finish. For years I have used IMDb as my go to source for ratings and questions about shows and movies. But it wasn't until I watched TNG's episode ""Violations,"" that I felt it was time I made an account to rate a show.SPOILERS BELOW This episode falls far short of Star Trek standards. It's down there with Nemesis, and for the same reason. As a woman, I don't enjoy sitting down to watch, what should be, a fun, entertaining sci-fi show, only to get to watch a female character get raped. Not only do we get to watch Riker of all people force himself on Troi, (in a very drawn out sequence of visions), but we get to see her disturbed reaction to the visions in between the flashes she's having of this ""memory."" The whole episode centers around a species that comes on the ship that have the ability to bring up old memories with the people they interact with. But one member of this species goes well beyond that, essentially mind raping Troi. That's right, her character has this crime committed against her not once, but twice(Nemesis). It's very tacky and distasteful, and it's made worse by the fact that when the crew begins investigating, they are all stricken down and end up in comas. It left me feeling rather irritated and uncomfortable, especially when it was revealed that the offending alien, would be sent to his home world for punishment.Troi basically had to take their word that he would be punished, and the overall crime was kind of glossed over because there was no guarantee that the offender's government wouldn't simply let him go when he reached their home world. But what made it even worse, was that in a future where there are telepathic races, the Federation hasn't developed any kind of laws to protect non-telepathic species of aliens from mental invasions. So essentially, what happened to Troi wasn't even viewed as a crime in the Federation's eyes, even if everyone on board knew that it was.And I haven't even touched on the fact that it sullies the relationship between Troi and Riker a bit. Even if the entire attack portion was the offending alien altering her memory, it looks as if it's Riker, and it's just an insult against the characters and Star Trek in general. There are too many worlds, too many aliens, and too many systems to explore. There was no reason to center an entire episode around a woman getting assaulted by an assailant she was powerless to stop. There are plenty of other shows that air episodes like that. I watch Star Trek for the futuristic possibility it portrays, not the dark problems that plague society today.I think that there's a reason I don't ever recall seeing this episode on TV. The episode is awful, it gives you no real sense of justice, it portrays Star Trek terribly, and it's one of those episodes that are best buried and forgotten.",1

This episode exemplifies, and perfectly too, just what's wrong with it. The idea of a telepathic alien species on the Enterprise was done much better in the original series; here the writers saw fit to turn what might have been a good mystery thriller into an overblown ""rape fantasy turned real""---what the blazes was the matter with them? And the worst of it was that all through the episode, indeed through the entire ""Next Generation"" series, we never saw a Vulcan---except for a couple of guest shots, such as in the fine story ""Sarek""---and what was desperately needed here was a good solid Vulcan troubleshooter who could have resolved the whole situation. The only things I liked were not to be found here---Worf's problems with his kid and Data's cat. And so, I will retire to a quiet corner and do one of Spock's Vulcan meditations to clear my head.

This explanation is just so wrong, and it so strongly contrasts with Data's abilities as an impeccable android that it made this episode below average.",5
13,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Violations (TV Episode 1992)",Such A Missed Opportunity,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***""Violations"" is just what it says on the tin: a series of psychic violations against the crew of the Enterprise, but more importantly a more systematic set of violations against the rules of good drama.I watched this episode when it first aired, and a reviewer whom I admired at the time (but whose name I have since forgotten) said it best: ""There's no suspense here, only rape."" That sticks with me because, having re-watched the episode recently, I can see exactly what he was talking about. From the very beginning - from the very end of the teaser, in fact - we already have a sense that the villain of the piece will be Jev (played with an almost mustache- twirling abandon by Ben Lemon). The last shot of the teaser focuses on him, and the trademarked ""danger"" music swells up. You'd have to be a fool not to guess that something is going to be wrong with this guy.The episode does itself no favors by then featuring Jev in each of the violations that he commits - against Troi, then Riker, then Beverly - and in the least subtle of ways. He takes the place of a particular character in that person's memory, though it's only in Troi's memory that he's actually forcing himself upon the victim in a rapey way. (I'm not trying to be facetious, by the way - the mental violations that Jev commits are clearly meant to be considered a form of rape, though only in Troi's case does that metaphor become all too literal. Twice, even.) There's no build-up of suspense, no possibility given that it COULD be Jev's father Tarmin, as Jev tries to make everyone believe later in the episode. Before he gets all rapey again and gives himself away, of course.And that's really the problem with the entire episode: there's no sense of control for the purpose of dramatic effect. Just like Jev, the episode's writers can't help themselves - this episode is going to be about RAPE, dammit, and forget telling a good story. Instead of subtlety, let's just knock the audience over their collective head with the message, or else it won't get through.Consider how much more interesting and suspenseful this episode could have been had the writers and director gone a different route: having Troi, Riker, and Crusher NOT see Jev's face in their visions, so that we know it's got to be one of the Ulians (which would also have allowed the woman Inad to be one of the suspects, if it had been handled right) but we don't know which one. Only at the end is it revealed that it's Jev - probably because he couldn't control himself, and Troi really IS that damned lovely.But that doesn't excuse his final act of self-revelation, nor the reasons why the producers of this episode didn't handle the story much more carefully. Not giving away the attacker's identity would have done nothing to cheapen the anti-rape subtext - if anything, it would have returned it to the level OF subtext rather than making it so obvious that the episode should carry a trigger warning for those who care about such things. And on top of it all, we'd get a creepy and mysterious story with a strong payoff at the end, rather than a story that's just...creepy.",4

This is partially a commentary on the Biosphere 2 project which was began in 1991 (this episode aired in February 1992), about whether life can be self-sustaining inside an enclosed structure.The Enterprise warns them that a stellar core fragment will pass by their colony on Moab IV, thereby destroying them, but because they are in a biosphere, they are unwilling to leave. The situation becomes more difficult when the leader of the biosphere, Conor, and Troi, become romantically involved, and several of the colonists eventually also want to leave (because now they see more than their biosphere world because of the Enterprise)!A true example where Star Trek and contemporary reality interact.Trivia note: it's noted by Picard that lower band frequencies were commonly used in the last century (200 years before). And, a ""ship in a bottle"" is mentioned here - this is an ongoing motif in the TNG series.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Masterpiece Society (TV Episode 1992)",Interesting,"This is one of the more interesting episodes of Star Trek TNG. Again a (then) current controversial research was brought to light in this episode and its pros and cons were weighed carefully.Enterprise tries to save a planet from imminent destruction by a fragment of a neutron star. In this planet people have been born by selective genetic engineering: blocking out genes with faults and disabilities and creating people for each vocation with the perfect set of traits for that particular vocation. While the team aboard Enterprise try to help this planet the rest of this episode deals with the possible disadvantages of such a genetically engineered society.In this nobody spends any part of their time searching their souls for what they want to do and what they would be good at - since they are designed and born to fill a particular job (artist, doctor, engineer, diplomat etc.). However their technology has not advanced as much as the Federation has in spite of all this. Geordi makes an insightful remark about this saying may be necessity had been the mother of invention in the Federation's case. If you do not struggle with anything you will not be motivated to find something to fix it. Another ironical situation when the technology behind a blind man's visor helps save a planet where a blind man is not genetically accepted is interesting.",

The Enterprise is tasked with monitoring the impact upon a solar system of a stellar core fragment. It scans the system and finds that there are life forms on a supposedly uninhabited planet. Well...After the viewer gets past the snub to physics of having such a stellar fragment emit visible light (how? WAY too small for fusion) the viewer is introduced to the 'colony' of perfect design. I was reminded that this episode came out a year and a half before ""Jurassic Park"" but was hoping for a character, like Data, to remind all concerned that to control for so many variables is impossible, especially over two centuries. The viewer, if an experienced Trekkie, should be waiting for the other shoe to drop, a large boot at that, of hearing a reference to the Eugenics Wars and Khan Noonien Singh. But no...Then, the love story begins, and the all-too-easily anticipated asylum requests begin. The viewer should enjoy this episode if he likes the director's use of close-ups, the likes of which this galaxy has never seen before!",1
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Masterpiece Society (TV Episode 1992)",A perfect society,This TNG story involves the Enterprise monitoring a star fragment that after the star went supernova it sent a fragment hurtling through space and the Enterprise is to monitor its movements.To their surprise they've discovered a human colony on what they thought was a lifeless planet existing in a domed atmosphere. The leader is John Snyder who leads a perfect genetically engineered society with people and lower forms of life down to the microorganisms living in harmony.But that star fragment as it passes by is going to create some real shock waves and that dome may not hold.There are a lot of things to consider in this episode. Nothing truly lives in a vacuum much as these colonists have created one. One of their scientists Dey Young by working with LeVar Burton from the Enterprise realizes how much they've missed in technological advance. In fact the existence of the transport system is a wonder some can't comprehend.As Snyder tries to consider what's best for their society he meets hidebound opposition from Ron Canada who thinks this contact with the Enterprise is subversive in and of itself. Not bothering to consider the Enterprise represents survival in some form.This is a thought provoking story. Even with genetic engineering is a truly perfect society achievable?,6

It's argued that this colony has no right to terminate fetuses with imperfections, because they could develop into people with something to contribute. Perhaps it's meant to only apply to detectable defects (e.g. Down's Syndrome), but it seems to be preaching against terminating pregnancies in general.",
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Masterpiece Society (TV Episode 1992)",Saving a genetically engineered society,"A stellar core fragment is going to pass close to a planet with a small human settlement; it will cause seismic activity that will certainly destroy the populations bio-dome leaving them exposed to the toxic atmosphere. This shouldn't be a problem as the Enterprise could easily transport them to a new world; the problem is they are genetically engineered isolationists who believe and contact with outsiders will ruin their society. Each person is engineered so they will suit their allotted task in life and be happy with that position. They agree to allow three people to beam down to coordinate a plan that might avoid an evacuation. Geordi quickly establishes a rapport with the colonies lead scientist, Hannah Bates, and the pair return to the Enterprise where the latter is astonished to see how science has progressed outside their closed society. Back on the planet Troi has developed a more intimate relationship with Aaron Conor, the colony's administrator. The stellar fragment is deflected but the colony isn't unaffected, having scene what is going on outside their sealed dome, several members have decided they wish to leave; Picard must decide whether or not he should take them even though it would leave the society without key people.The idea of a 'perfect' society created by genetic engineering or selective breeding, where imperfect foetuses are aborted, will inevitably lead to comparisons with the eugenic programmes espoused by the Nazis even though in this case the society appears to work up to a point. Thankfully that comparison isn't directly stated here even though the society is ultimately saved thanks to Geordi; a character who's blindness would mean he wouldn't have had a chance of life there. This more subtle approach lets the viewer make up their own mind about the rights and wrongs of such a society. Guest stars Dey Young and John Snyder are good as Hannah and Aaron; although the speed with which the latter's character got involved with Troi was a little surprising given their attitudes to genetic perfection she isn't even human! The concluding dilemma about whether to allow some colonists to leave was more interesting than the danger from the stellar fragment as its outcome couldn't be guessed. Overall an interesting episode that raised some interesting moral questions without preaching excessively.",7
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Masterpiece Society (TV Episode 1992)",you preserve it..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 05Not the ethical throughout provoking dilemmas, nor the smart innovative concepts, this season is well aware of its audience from now, and the writers willfully fiddles with the characters like puppets and just lets their history and connection with their fans works the charm.The Masterpiece SocietyThe Masterpiece Society is clearly flawed but what's annoying about it, is that it isn't smart enough to even fool you once, this love affair quickly turns into a homesick dilemma as it enters in its latter stages.",
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Masterpiece Society (TV Episode 1992)",A fairly average episode,"I didn't really think this episode was especially good or bad. The concept of a such a selectively bred society should be seen as fairly ridiculous to anyone with half a brain. Only a real handful of people left at the end of the episode, so what would happen if some natural event caused you to lose the same people? The acting was fine, though I found the colony leader to be fairly annoying to watch and listen to. The science is pretty off, such as saying that a neutron star disintegrated, but I get it's more about the story.Overall you won't miss much by skipping ahead on occasion or just entirely skipping the episode.",5

Being intergalactic nice-guys, the Enterprise offers to help the folks living on a colony there. However, inexplicably, the folks on the colony are difficult and only eventually respond to the ship's calls. The reason they were hesitant, is that the colony is some sort of weird eugenics experiment--where children are bred to be 'perfect' and no imperfections are allowed. This reminded me of the Nazi ideals, but the Enterprise showed surprising respect for these jerks. However, contact with these folks ends up changing their society, as some of the members decided it just isn't worth staying on their isolated little enclave.This is an okay episode.

Commander Riker and Ensign Ro become increasingly close and even end up sharing a bed! The puzzlement between the crew was fun to watch and eventually Commander McDuff is found out to be the enemy and his plan is thwarted. Watch Worf, even through his memory loss, obey the Captain!

1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Conundrum (TV Episode 1992)",Very interesting dilemma,"First off, there are plenty of plot holes if one wants to drill into that aspect of this episode. But I found the story interesting and my take on this episode was more about how the crew dealt with the 'conundrum'.**Specific Spoiler** When they were trying to figure out what positions to take, and Worf took over, I found that funny, but also it works from a military view. Worf is instinctively tactical and protective and would be excellent to have in command during an emergency - he was the first to move forward and organize and although his plan was pretty much all about offense and defense it would serve just fine in such a situation and be completely appropriate during a command emergency. It might have been interesting to leave him in command and see how he responded to the less aggressive suggestions and viewpoints from the command team.Only a series that had gone on this long could pull off an episode like this so well. It was very interesting watching the various people fall into their roles by nature - Riker overseeing and directing Ro, who was gung-ho, Geordi getting wrapped up in the computer/technical problems, Picard keeping a distance and trying to formulate an overall view of what was going on before taking any action that might add to the problems. This was very entertaining, but would not have been so if one didn't have a good familiarity with the crew from previous episodes.I gave it a high rating because it was fun to see them find their place and eventually work out the mystery, and I was able to overlook some of the questionable aspects of the situation (such as 'memory wiping' being a good enough weapon to not need the Enterprise in the first place or having the tech to disable Data but not taking over as captain, etc..) All that aside, it was great to watch the crew come together by their very nature and overcoming the problem.",8
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Conundrum (TV Episode 1992)","Despite the Plot Holes, a good, fun Ep","I agree with the previous reviewer in that this sp had numerous plot holes and I even agree with that reviewers list of ""conundrums"" in ""conundrum"": but regardless of these, this episode moves fast and has some interesting interactions in it... Particularly between Ro and Riker.When I first saw this ep during the 5th season of the original run of ST:TNG, I was drawn into it. Now, the Enterprise has superior tech to the Lysians and the Sutters, but it is not too far of a stretch, particularly in the opening scene where the Sutterian (?) ship wipes the memory of not only all of the races on the USS Enterprise, but Data as well. Let me explain why this could be ""Incorrectly regarded as Goofs"". Someone else conjectured, why could not the Sutterian do this to Lysian ships? Or to the Lysian High Command? Maybe those two races are similar, and the method used to selectively wipe the Enterprise ""Aliens"" would not work with the Lysians. I do not think the plot: of a single agent, implanting himself into a command structure that had already existed, to influence them to attack a culture of significantly less technology, is too far of a stretch at all. Because it happened with the US in Vietnam. Except the US learned the hard way, it does not take Technology alone to win wars, as the Vietnamese were experts in using lower tech to kill us and even would take our weapons and use our weapons against us. So, this Sutterian could have implanted himself onto a Federation Vessel just as easily.As much as I hated Macduff's guts when I first saw him, I had to admire his gall. Even Worf has a healthy respect for ""Unmitigated Gall"". Now, the other matter: That Macduff had to 1) Scan the Enterprise 2) Selectively Erase long term memory while leaving learned skills 3) Manufacture an Identity for Himself and Implant himself at a higher rank than Riker 4) actually perform the selective erasure and then beam himself, fully disguised and clothed and RANKED onto the Enterprise Bridge and PLANT the false information into the computer- All in one instant - This is another thing, Incorrectly regarded as a Goof. How do we know, that this all occurred in the time that beam of Green light spread across the Enterprise? I think a better explanation would be that it took an amount of time for the Sutteran to accomplish all these things, and that the Enterprise Crew were held in a state of non-awareness, and when ready, the chronometers were started again.Now, the Sutteran could have stolen a shuttle, or even made himself Captain, although I think that the Crew would not have accepted him in that role. We see that Macduff was wholly ALONE - He did not interact with the other crewmembers as Riker did. It would have been discovered, the crew would have resisted, a scenario like that even happened on STTNG where Picard was replaced, and the crew figured it out and relieved him of command.Now the topmost events in the ep, are Riker's interactions with Ro, cos those characters had an already existing chemistry. I'm glad this was explored in this ep.This was one of my Favourite Eps of the whole series. There was practically no ""dead air"" - It was all action throughout - And if not action, discovery. And the main plothole of the ep, the Sutterans lower tech, despite the power to alter memory, was touched on by Riker in the denouement of the ep.",

Michelle Forbes also returns as Ensign Ro Laren (who with her memory lapse romantically gets involved with a memory lapsed Riker!).

While Macbeth never appeared on Star Trek, MacDuff showed up here. We close viewers of Star Trek notice quickly that this guy shouldn't be here. What the heck is he up to? We find out quickly that he is a war monger. The neat thing is that while the crew didn't know who they were, they maintained their areas of expertise. Worf assumes authority which would be a natural leap, considering self-survival is the first thing they must establish. A things play out, they believe they are at war and have been for a long time. This helps to fuse them into soldiers, although Picard begins to have some doubts. MacDuff eggs people on, trying to convince them they must kill or be killed. Clues slowly surface and once they know their positions on the ship, it helps to define them. Unfortunately, it concludes so abruptly, we don't get to see the pieces fall into place.

5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Conundrum (TV Episode 1992)","A devious plot, that's for sure!","""Conundrum"" is a really cool episode--with a very interesting and very devious plot. The Enterprise comes upon a strange ship. The ship begins scanning the Enterprise and suddenly EVERYONE (including Data) has their memory wiped. The ship is now filled with crew who have no idea who they are and who is in charge. It's interesting how some of the crew change personalities or assume things--such as Ro suddenly NOT being an angry and disagreeable lady and Worf automatically assuming HE is the Captain! But it gets VERY devious when you realize that there is a NEW second in command--a Commander McDuff. And, even more devious is that the computer system has been altered to tell them that they've been at war with the Lysians for years and are to proceed to Lysian space to destroy them!! So, the evil aliens at the beginning of the show are using the Enterprise and its crew to destroy their enemies! Nice folks, huh? So will the Enterprise figure out what's happening before it's too late? This is a terrific episode with one huge problem--why didn't the aliens just make McDuff the Captain?! Then, their evil plan would have gone without a hitch. Still, despite this, the show is a really novel idea and impressed me because of this. Plus, I LIKE devious!!",
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Conundrum (TV Episode 1992)",The crew lose their memories,"Shortly after this episode opens the Enterprise encounters a small alien ship; it doesn't appear to pose any treat so Picard doesn't worry when it starts to scan the Enterprise. Then suddenly the entire crew, including Data, find their memories wiped. They still have their skills but have no idea who they are or why they are there. The computer records are also unavailable at first so they will have to work out who is who. For the most part they guess their roles but there are some exceptions; Worf assumes himself to be the captain and amusingly Data is assumed to be the barman! There is also a new crewman; Commander MacDuff who seems to be one of the senior bridge officers. When they eventually access the computer they discover who everybody is, including MacDuff who is apparently second in command. They also find their orders the Federation has been in a long war with the Lysian's and now the Enterprise is to destroy their command centre. As they head into Lysian space they start to feel something is very wrong; the Lysians are poorly armed and clearly no match for the federation; will they act on these concerns or follow the orders they found in the computer.This was a really good episode with a great mix of drama and humour. The idea of the Enterprise being hijacked in such a way that the crew didn't realise it was interesting. The fact that there are often 'one episode' characters on the bridge means it isn't too obvious that MacDuff is the cuckoo on the nest until we are told he is second in command and there are logical reasons for why certain crew members don't know their true function on the ship; Worf's sash sets him apart from the others and Data was making a drink for Troi when the memory wipe occurred. More amusement comes from the usually argumentative Ensign Ro who thinks she may have been involved with Riker so let's herself into his room for a night of passion! This leads to a priceless scene at the end once they have their memories back. The cast do a great job making the strange situation believable; each character acting almost as they would normally but not quite due to their memory loss; seeing Michelle Forbes as Ensign Ro makes me wish her character makes me wish she was in more episodes. Overall a really good episode with some great ideas; there are some plot holes of course but these aren't too hard to ignore.",9
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Conundrum (TV Episode 1992)",Questions abound,"'Conundrum' is an episode I hadn't seen before and it's greatness is due to its premise; an inventive way to shake things up on a long- running show. The crew suffer amnesia and find themselves at war with an unknown race, at the same time left to guess what positions they hold on the ship. this is how you get Word in the center chair, Picard at the helm, and data tending bar. It also (temporarily) rewrites the book on relationships; Riker shacks up with Ro while his history with Troi is nebulous. The payoff is in the final scene when both women are wise and Riker's in the doghouse. But the episode's an inherent riddle. Why is there no intel on the ship and who's this new guy MacDuff as first officer? Why are they at war with the Lysians, and why does this feel like a dream? It's that morality Picard's struggling with that makes this entertaining. 8/10",8

Guinan is completely missing here and Data briefly serves as a bartender.Still, it's one of the better episodes, a real mystery similar to ""Clues"" but much better than that episode.",
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Conundrum (TV Episode 1992)",Conundrum,"You know, there are a lot of really fascinating episodes sprinkled throughout the series of Star Trek: The Next Generation that might surprise Trek fans when they discover them. I think ""Conundrum"" is one heck of an entertainingly unique episode as it turns the Enterprise crew on its head. Get this for a premise: a ""mind scan"" wipes out the memory of the entire Enterprise crew. No one on board can remember their identity, personal experiences, as if a mental block represses anything that might recall who they are. Not only that, but personal and medical histories are completely removed from the memory banks of the Enterprise's computers. Even worse, computers indicate the Enterprise is caught in a war with a people who have inferior defense and weapon technology, known as the Lysians, their supposed objective to destroy the Lysian Central Command Outpost, only a few days away. The Enterprise encounters a Lysian cruiser with limited shields and weapons capabilities, certainly no match for a galaxy class starship. As the crew grapple with the reasoning behind this war, something doesn't feel right to anyone but Commander MacDuff (Erich Anderson), who just so happens to show up when the Enterprise crew's memory was wiped, with a rank higher than Riker's. That is obviously a red flag, especially when MacDuff starts reinforcing the mission and insisting on the Enterprise's firing upon the weak Lysian cruiser, a ship destroyed way too easily. Meanwhile, Picard asks Crusher to study known techniques that have been used to solve memory wipes in the past.What makes this episode especially cool and intriguing is how the crew deals with not knowing who they are, realizing that they still maintain knowledge of how to run the ship, but unable to recall their identities. Worf, for a little while, assumes command and no one challenges him for the role! Riker and Ensign Ro conduct interviews with crew members, look into certain aspects of Enterprise computer functions, searching for possible problems, as does Geordi who heads to Engineering, soon accompanied by ""bartender"" Data (hilarious scene; how this is pulled off, Data making a certain drink for Troi because he lost a game, is a doozy), as they attempt to correct the block denying access to certain important files. Riker and Ro eventually even become romantically involved! Troi is the one who voices the most concern about this whole war mission and Picard is uneasy as well. What is importantly established here is that despite the erase of who they are, their key abilities are still alive and well. Each member has unique characteristics and personalities that equipped them for their roles on the Enterprise. It is amazing that the race that caused the memory wipe, quite a weapon to use against the enemy, would even need to bother with the Enterpriseif anything; they could just attack the Lysians using this memory wipe weapon. Dwelling on the flaws will cause you to lose sight of what makes the episode so much fun: despite the loss of memory, we follow the crew as they uncover answers to mysteries that have put them in the ""conundrum"", and even though they have lost memories, their humanity and moral compass won't allow them to just eradicate a species without logically looking at the situation from all angles. What I found truly enjoyable was how each character contemplates their possible functions and identities, such as (1) Geordi wonders to Data if there are a whole race of androids or maybe even an android for every starship, (2) Riker is in his living quarters noticing trinkets that describe hobbies of his, and (3) Troi addressing specific feelings for Riker that are undefined yet there.",8

11,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Conundrum (TV Episode 1992)",More Fluff from MacDuff.,"This is one of the cooler episodes in a long time. BUT, this episode has some major plot holes that are just downright embarrassing.One: If the alien ship could wipe their memories, why not do that to their enemies and win the war that way?Two: If you have wiped out all the memories of the crew, and installed one of your own, why not make yourself Captain? The second officer has no control over the crew as long as there is the captain in charge. Why not just work around this and make sure you are in charge to get the mission done your way. Besides, the Captain has to know the least about the operation of the ship than any other rank including ensign. And no one would ever call him on it if he didn't know something. When is the last time you saw Cpt. Picard fire photons, phasers, do a transport, or align the warp coils? Pretty much never. I think he controlled the helm on the Enterprise once before this. In fact this is one of the rare episodes where you see him man another station than the captain's chair. Three: How could an alien race that was 100 years behind them have any understanding of how to wipe the crew's memory, get through their shields, or even run the ship at all? The memory wipe was instant. Which brings me to my next point.Four: In which of the 5 seconds they were stunned did MacDuff become fully dressed in uniform, change the personnel files, and then get into position before they realized what was going on? Doesn't leave a lot of time for pre-mission briefing like studying their files while they are oblivious. Hardly something a technologically inferior race could handle.Five: If you have the crew dead to rights, why not just transport them into space one by one( tell them they are going planet-side) and then take over the ship and its superior technology. It would be an intelligence coup. Besides, if Starfleet never knew it happened they would have no idea where to look for it. Especially amongst the technologically inferior.Six: If a single photon torpedo was all it would take to end their war why didn't they just steal a bunch of those? Maybe a launcher or two. Grab a shuttle and go. You get a shuttle to take apart too. I believe they have phasers on them at least. If nothing else, they have advanced computers, and impulse engines to retro-engineer.Seven: If they could understand Data enough to alter his circuitry wouldn't they be of a higher technological level than 100 years in the past? Eight: Star Trek completely ignores the lessons of the past. Humanity is linear. We build upon the past. Things that have worked for 1000 years will still work in the future. Things like military tactics, commando style raids, intelligence coups, logistics, economy(I love how Picard ""bought"" a totem for Riker on Riza), EVEN THE WAY THE NAVY WORKS. None of this is applied. In the navy, an admiral runs the flagship not a captain. In the navy the flagship is usually a carrier, not a frigate which is a tiny boat used to help defend a carrier. In fact I would label the Enterprise as a cruiser which is much larger than a frigate. A Flagship has a fleet which surrounds it and protects it at all times while it attempts to complete a military mission. In the Star Trek universe, they would have you believe that the Enterprise is the only ship in the universe unless the story calls for more.What the Enterprise is, really, is an ambassador's ship, and this makes about 0 sense from a navy perspective.If I had made TNG I would have made the Enterprise a carrier with fighters a la Battlestar Galactica style. I would have made it a fleet. And Picard would be an Admiral. And there would be a war.Ships don't run around too much in times of peace, other than as displays of power in ports of call. They are made for war. Instead of making humanity in the future a bunch of wussies, we could be more realistic and realize that we were bred to destroy things. Humanity is a war-like race. I know I have seriously digressed but from a Navy standpoint, BSG is a far more accurate view of the future in my opinion. They actually use navy terms and concepts and put them into action.None of this makes any sense. From a completely oblivious standpoint, however, this episode is fun and different. The scene where the alien gets shot with the phaser is just awesome. The sound it makes and the visuals were cool as can be, even to this day.I just wish they had hired a continuity crew to go through and make sure all of this stuff makes sense in fitting into the Star Trek Universe. If you ask me the Next Generation has more plot holes than all the other series combined. There are just WAY too many inconsistencies brought on by a need to write a decent episode, at the cost of the series' integrity. The reason I think this is, is because TNG was written by so many different writers. It feels like a pulp fiction novella series half the time.",7

Crusher is horrified at the idea of using such a risky experimental procedure and instead tells Worf about an alternative that should return him to sixty percent mobility; which isn't enough for him. Riker also has a dilemma; he finds the idea of suicide repellent as Worf could live a productive life but at the same he doesn't want to fail his friend luckily for him there is a way out within Klingon custom that could pressure Worf into trying the dangerous treatment.This is very much an 'issue of the week' episode and it is quite clear who we are meant to see as right and who we are meant to see as wrong. Worf's desire to follow Klingon custom and kill himself is clearly meant to be wrong as it is constantly stressed that he could still live a productive life and if that weren't enough we get to see his son's reaction. Equally Dr Russell's desire to use risky procedures is shown as wrong despite the fact that it is the only way to save Worf from himself; nobody seems to point out that many routine procedures started off as risky experiments. There is also little sense of drama as we know full well that Worf will survive although that may be down to knowing he features in future episodes; it is possible that original viewers may have thought this was a way to write him out of the series.

We're lead to believe that Worf shouldn't commit suicide, because of some moral objection two other characters have (when it's not about their lives). Other reviewers have mentioned ""Half a Life"" and how the message was not to interfere with another culture with a ritual suicide, but here, the exact opposite message is preached. They're right about the contradictory messages between these two episodes.The episode reminds me of the Terri Schiavo case. She was in a persistent vegetative state and as per her positions from before going into a coma, she didn't want to be on prolonged life support, but the conservatives decided to stick their nose in and there was a huge polemic where there didn't need to be.On the other hand, if this episode had focused on the ethics of the specialist using patients as objects of experimentation, it might have had a good message, but in the end, it seems to have been written by a preacher who wanted to push his life-is-sacred dogma even when he's not in church.",4

8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Ethics (TV Episode 1992)",OK episode but too much self-righteous pandering,"The premise of the episode is that Wharf is injured while performing a routine job on the ship. The injury is severe and leaves him basically paralyzed from the neck down. As expected from a Klingon, Wharf decided life is no longer worth living and chooses to perform a Klingon ritual of suicide. Now this is where the story arc diverges into to different stories.The first one revolves around Riker who Wharf has asked to assist him in this ritual do to their friendship. Riker becomes angry and in a conversation with Picard Riker seems to be emotionally unstable due to his anger. The writers obviously had an agenda as they used Riker on 2 different occasions to make self-righteous speeches attacking Wharf for his decision. Picard was used as the foil and showed much more of an ability to keep a level head and not allow his emotions to control his actions. Picard was able to make Riker see that Wharf would not have chosen Riker if not for their friendship and Wharf's trust in Riker. And that while Riker believes Wharf's life can be full from this point on, for all intents and purposes wharf's life is over in wharf's belief system. However, this did not stop Riker from lecturing Wharf with more condescending anger before finally telling Wharf that he would not assist but that Wharf's son should assist due to Klingon tradition.The second story arc involves Dr. Crusher and a Dr. Russell who was brought on board to help with Wharf. Dr. Russell has been doing research in replicating parts of the body/organs and using them to repair bodies. However their has not been any trials on humans yet. Also contributing to the problem is that there is little to no research in Klingon spinal injuries due to the fact Klingons just let their own die if they have such an injury. So basically it turns out that there is only a 34 or less percent chance this procedure would work. From this point on Crusher goes on a self-righteous crusade against Dr. Russell. Crusher has decided that Russell is giving Wharf false hope and not trying to just keep him alive and make his life as comfortable as possible. We are treated to some of Crushers attitude when at the end of the procedure to replace Wharf's spine he goes into cardiac arrest. Crusher orders higher and higher doses of drugs to be injected to revive Wharf. Dr. Russell points out that Crusher will kill him at which point crusher childishly says ""Looks like you've already done a pretty good job of that doctor."" Seriously? Talk about unprofessional behavior. Unable to revive him they call his death and time. a few minutes later wharf begins to revive. apparently it took some time for his body to adjust to the new spine. Wharf is OK but has to go through therapy to walk again. At the end Dr. Russell goes into Crushers office to say goodbye.

Finally after a few questions and Russell saying Crusher cannot admit Russell helped wharf Crusher goes into a self-righteous rant about how Russell gambled and wharf won, but not all Russell's patients are so lucky, referring to an earlier scene where Russell used an experimental drug to try and save a patient. She finally says, ""enjoy your laurels doctor, I'm not sure I could."" So while the story itself was pretty good, the way they used Riker and Crusher to push a philosophical agenda was a quite a put off. Picard did come across much more stable in this episode, as he always does. And Troi was also there to help Wharf's son. I found myself losing a lot of respect for both Riker and Crusher. Crusher came across as more of a preacher than a doctor, as did Riker.",5
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Ethics (TV Episode 1992)",all of your mobility..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 05Not the ethical throughout provoking dilemmas, nor the smart innovative concepts, this season is well aware of its audience from now, and the writers willfully fiddles with the characters like puppets and just lets their history and connection with their fans works the charm.EthicsA higher concept that feeds on Ethics, claims the writer and it is exactly what you get, and even though at times it seems like they are waiting for the clock to struck the hour bell, all of this is still worth the drama it goes through.",

When Soren, a J'Naii pilot, joins Commander Riker in locating the shuttle, a friendship is formed between them and soon they become romantically involved.This is where the conflict arises - because the J'Naii are genderless, what Soren is doing is illegal and she must now be arrested and ""cured"".Another intriguing episode in the true spirit of Star Trek.Trivia note: Riker mentions a new unit of measurement - a millicochrane (named after Zephram Cochrane).

1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Outcast (TV Episode 1992)","At times, EXTREMELY preachy but also ahead of its time.","This episode probably wasn't received well by many when it was first aired in 1992, as it addresses homosexuality and inter-sex beings-- topics that were rarely talked about on American TV in the early 90s. Because of this, it was rather groundbreaking. The only serious problem with the show is that at times, especially near the end.Riker, the intergalactic playboy, is working with a person from Genai. Soren is from a planet where everyone is androgynous--and she is quite curious about human sexuality. She and Riker talk about this quite a bit during their mission together and you eventually learn that Soren is unusual for one of the Genai, she has sexual urges towards males. However, she MUST keep it a secret, as on her planet inter-sex is the only option. And, she is attracted to Riker...and vice-versa. What's going to happen if anyone on Genai learns about Soren's 'perversion'?The show had a lot of good points and the relationship between Riker and Soren was very interesting. My only complaint is that the show was incredibly unsubtle and preachy near the end--with Riker speechifying instead of uttering dialog. Still, it's well worth seeing.",7
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Outcast (TV Episode 1992)",In the spirit of the original show,"About a month after reviewing many of the original Star Trek shows from the 1960s, seeing many for the first time in more than 20 years, I watched this episode for only the second time ever - the first time since it was shown originally. I cannot understand all the hatred for this episode by other reviewers here on IMDb: it's as preachy and unrealistic as those original Star Trek episodes, and like the original, presents a social issue we are actually dealing with right now in a barely-veiled way. The episode is obviously talking about homosexuality rather than an androgynous and asexual race, and now, almost 15 years after it premiered, it's just as powerful to see Soren using so many of the same arguments that people have had to use for same-sex relationships and marriage equality. Another reviewer said that he doesn't understand why it's a bad thing that Soren is ""reprogrammed"", because at the end, she is glad she's been ""cured."" Ridiculous! Go watch the Twilight Zone episode ""Number 12 Looks Just Like You"" - she's also really happy at the end after she's been ""reprogrammed."" Do you think that's also a happy ending?!This episode is rarely shown anymore, and I have wondered why. Perhaps because of fear that some people will misinterpret as an attack on people who are transgendered or asexual? I'd like to give people more credit than that - surely we can appreciate this pioneering episode for its original intentions in the time it was made.",9
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Outcast (TV Episode 1992)",A noble attempt that failed,"SPOILERS AHEAD: In this episode, the ""Enterprise"" ends up at a planet where the inhabitants are androgynous. Commander Riker works with one of them, Soren, and they end up falling in love. Problem: these aliens are forbidden to express sexual desires inclined to only one gender (Soren tends towards female behavior), so she is ""tried"" and taken away for psychological reprogramming when their relationship is discovered.The episode is famous, of course, for trying to take on the way gay people are treated in our culture, much as the original ""Star Trek"" took on issues such as the Vietnam War and racism. A big plus is that, up until the trial, the performances are solid and the writing is very good. As someone else here said, Soren's self-defense speech is rather heavy handed, perhaps making the point a bit too obviously.However, my biggest problem is with what happens after Soren is taken away. Forbidden from the planet, Riker decides to disregard his Starfleet training and orders so that he can sneak down to the planet and rescue his new love. He also manages to convince the usually by-the-book Klingon Lt. Worf to go along with his plan. This is TOTALLY out of character for both Riker and Worf. This really rings falsely against the way both characters had been developed throughout the course of the series. The writer, Jeri Taylor, really should have known better. She decided to make the Big Social Statement at the expense of Riker and Worf. As a result, Jonathan Frakes gives an unconvincing performance during the last quarter of the episode, totally ruining it for me. The ending, of course, is predictable.It's good that a television show tries for something other than mindless entertainment. But it can't be done with plot contrivances which go against the grain of the show's premise or its characters, which is what happens here. Certainly not one of the worst moments for ""TNG"", but far from its best.",4
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Outcast (TV Episode 1992)",Everyone misses the most interesting thing,"OK, let's get the basics out of the way first. This is definitely a flawed episode. It is supposed to be an allegory, but it comes off as unsubtle, heavy-handed, and preachy. Even so, the allegory is not a bad one. In this way it has much in common with the original series episode about the half-black, half-white people.From a plot perspective, the big problem is, as many have pointed out, that it makes no sense for Riker to be so quickly and completely consumed by this androgynous person. Someone else made a very good case showing how they are completely not his type. But even aside from that, even if we allow that he was, for whatever reason, attracted, it is still someone he has known for a very short time, and it makes no sense for him to risk his whole career over it, when usually he's not exactly Mr. Commitment. Hell, he never even married Deanna, the closest thing that could be called the love of his life! But I disagree with the notion that it was also out of character for Worf to join him. I can see Worf joining him. Let's face it, as much as Worf is loyal to Star Fleet and the Federation, you have to admit, he has a pretty dull life by Klingon standards. Here was a chance to go on an exciting, dangerous mission, *and* he could justify it by Klingon honor and values (standing by a friend)! Not so far-fetched that he would seize the opportunity.But I think a number of people have missed the point in complaining that the episode somehow copped out. That it should have had a male play the love interest, or addressed homosexuality more directly. People, it's an *allegory*! It's NOT a story about homosexuality or transsexuality or any of that. It's a story with broad philosophical implications that can then *be applied* back to issues like homosexuality or transsexuality. Are you people *so* concrete-bound that you think it has to have *actual* homosexuality* in it to be of any value? Had they cast the love interest with a male actor, it would have made zero sense. First, this was supposed to be an androgynous character who none-the-less identified as a female. So why on *earth* would you cast such a person with a male? Second, it's hard enough, as it is, to believe that Riker would be so attracted to such an androgynous, even if slightly female, person. There's no WAY he would have been attracted to an androgynous slightly male person, unless one is prepared to suddenly, out of the blue, declare that, oh, by the way, Riker is and has always been bi. Now I'm not saying that a person like Riker couldn't be bi. But for four and a half years there had been absolutely no hint of anything remotely like this (and there never would be again for the rest of the series. Or movies). That would simply have been *bad writing*. You don't radically alter a central character for the sake of one week's episode.But what I find remarkable is that nobody has discussed what I consider to be the most interesting aspect of the story: the ending. Through the whole thing, we are all comfortable, complacently entrenched in the opinion that government depicted is a horrible authoritarian tyranny. When they assert a benevolent intent, that their intervention really does make the targeted subjects happier, we scoff. But in the end, it seems there's something in what they claim: our protagonist-cum-victim seems to very sincerely be happy and grateful for their transformation. And this raises a really *interesting* philosophical question: does the end justify the means in such cases? Is it OK for the state to deny personal choice if it really will be to the citizen's benefit? Are there, or could there be cases where the state really does know what's best for you, better than you do yourself? Personally, I think the answer is 'no', but the story here makes you at least question and reflect. You can't simply dismiss it. I think it is unfortunate that the episode does not explore this issue more.",5

As an asexual person who falls on the transgender spectrum, this episode seemed to really appeal to me. I loved that the episode focused on a transgender individual in such a strict society (and my biases were rooting for her the whole time.) Yes, there were bits and pieces that could have been done much better, but at the time it was created this episode was pretty good and risky. The ending, with one day of brainwashing fully swiping away her true identity, hit me pretty hard, though. I hope someday this society evolves past their barbaric ways.",7
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Outcast (TV Episode 1992)",Riker falls for a genderless alien,"The Enterprise has been called to help a species known as the J'naii. One of their shuttle craft has vanished and investigations suggest that it has entered a pocket of null space. If so it will have lost power and it is only a matter of time before life support fails as well. Riker works with Soren, one of the J'naii to come up with a solution. The J'naii are a genderless species and Soren is curious about what it is like to have a specific gender. It gradually emerges that not all J'naii are exactly genderless; some feel more inclined to be one gender than the other and those are considered deviants; Soren inclines to being female and has developed feelings for Riker and he has feelings for her. Things go smoothly unlit their relationship is discovered and Soren is sentenced to be 'cured'.This episode is clearly meant as a metaphor for how many in society view homosexuality; and not a particularly subtle one at that. The story is interesting and clearly ahead of its time given how attitudes have changed since the episode was made. Viewing it now though it doesn't appear as daring as it once would have; the J'naii may be genderless but it is obvious that Soren is played by a woman; perhaps having Riker fall for a genderless character played by a somewhat androgynous male would have been going too far in the early '90s; that isn't the biggest problem though; that is saved for the end the fact that Soren was 'cured' didn't fit at all well with the episodes otherwise progressive ideas. Despite those faults I thought it was an interesting episode with some fascinating ideas. This was helped by fine performances from Jonathan Frakes and Melinda Culea as Riker and Soren; they had a good chemistry and I believed in their relationship even though they hadn't known each other long. The plot about the lost shuttle is decent enough but is clearly just a device to bring Riker and Soren together.",7

For one, I don't understand why Riker always kisses every thing that moves. I guess he is somehow related to Kirk. I don't understand how Riker fell in love so quickly with the he/she/it or hesheit (I made that up) - enough to jeopardize the prime directive and his career. Moreover, Picard is not even a 'little' phased that his first officer who is all of a sudden thinking of breaking the highest, most important rule of Star Fleet?And why the hell did Worf join in? That part makes no sense at all (actually, the whole episode makes no sense). Riker's loss of character was not warranted or built-up in any way. Picard's lack of interest in his first officer's sudden loss of control and disregard for rules was also out of character for the captain and destroyed what little the episode had going.Oh and Geordi has a beard.",3
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Outcast (TV Episode 1992)",Required viewing for those dealing with at risk LGBT youth,One of the best TNG episodes ever done and it ought to be required viewing for young audiences and those who deal with at risk youth. Sad that the ones who need the lessons from this story will never see it.The Enterprise is helping out a race that has developed into androgyny over time on a rescue mission. But in working with Melinda Culea she says that in their culture there are those who start showing specific gender traits. For them it can be a hard life and the planet culture says that conversion therapy back to androgyny is the law.The prime directive places a burden on Jonathan Frakes who has reciprocated some romantic feelings that Culea has tossed in his direction. It's an internal cultural matter. It weighs heavy on Riker's soul.With every country in the world now dealing with sexual orientation and gender identity and expression issues this episode is a great example of looking at the issue through the other end of Alice's looking glass. Don't miss this one.,9
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Outcast (TV Episode 1992)",Disturbing Ep,"Yow! Well I'm NOT changing my rating. This is basically a BAD episode. Oh, I get what Jeri Taylor was trying to say, but Riker is not the Crew member to do this thing.One of the weakest TNG Eps ever. Mainly, because Riker would NOT go for Melinda Culea even out of the alien makeup and allegedly ""androgynous"" aspect of said aliens. She not only is not his type, she is WAY not his type. Especially since Riker likes WOMEN, and Culea is playing a Sexless Alien. But I get the statement about Alternate Lifestyle, having lived on Castro Street for several years as a straight, and learning how to accept people's choices.Riker repeatedly shows his preference for ""Sultry"" dark haired females: Epitomized by Carolyn McCormick as ""Minuet"" in the First Season Ep ""11001001"" - This is Riker's Ultimate ""Dream Girl"" - If she were real, Riker would have had her. But As she was not real, Riker commonly is attracted to women who are similar, namely Counselor Troi, and sometimes Ensign Ro. Through the series, we've seen Riker parade a large amount of women through 10-Forward, and at one time he even has romantic Banter with Guinan (But only for Wesley Crusher's benefit). I honestly think he would not have been interested in Culea's character. And Ironically, she plays a similar role in Chris Carter's ""MillenniuM"", as a woman with Lupus who has a crush on Frank Black.Therefore, it was not only wholly and completely out of character for Riker to not only fall for this person, but that Riker was determined to leave STARFLEET for said baggage, Riker would never have done this, not with his Aspirations of becoming Captain, attained only in Star Trek X: Nemesis.Now, I see no problem with Riker wanting to experiment with a race that could be either male or female, but to end his CAREER for her/him/it? Would never happen.Now Jeri Taylor had a good idea with this story, although it was unbelievable with Riker playing the Love Interest, it may have worked with ""Broccoli""/Dwight Schultz - Or Geordi, even. Giving this a ""5"" because it is still a TNG Ep, and had some good things in it.",5
10,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Outcast (TV Episode 1992)",The complete cop-out,"I haven't been so disappointed in a Star Trek for a long time.This episode is a complete cop-out. it would have been interesting to study a genderless society. But of course, the episode just goes to demonstrate the exact contrary of the premise: there can never be a REAL genderless society according to Star trek. OF COURSE in the end they're all either male or female, and OF COURSE the one Jnail they encounter is very interested in genders and wants to be one of them...(apparently they've never met a gendered society... oh wait actually they have! so why the questions?). On the other hand of course, no crewman from the Enterprise is remotely interested in the lack of gender. As usual, the ""aliens"" are aliens, while the humans aren't really alien to the aliens (because you know, they're the ones who are NORMAL). I'm not even speaking of the fact that apparently no one on the Star Trek team is aware of the difference between ""gay"" and ""transgender"". Apparently the idea was to make something about gay people - without featuring ANYTHING vaguely gay of course, which is why Soren is obviously a girl. But in the end, that show is about gender identity, nothing else. And apparently it absolutely impossible to be something else than either male or female in the entire universe. Which is not only stupid but boring.But it also reveals a larger problem in Star Trek - as much as I love this show - the inability to stick to its own premise: ST pretends to explore different types of societies but usually ends up being incapable to exploring the idea of REALLY different cultures. The Vulcans are supposed to be emotionless, except that we see them struggling with their emotions 90% of the time. The Jnail are supposedly genderless except they actually have genders that they repress and any genderlessness is naturally born out of a dictatorship etc...True difference is difficult. It's hard to understand, confusing and it's what brings about conflicts. Star Trek is all talk (Picard, Janeway, ... always profess having to abide by the difference in cultures) but is no walk (the races ""imagined"" most often end up reinforcing whatever status quo the White Straight Western World holds dear at the time the episode is created). This episode (and many others!) could have been so much more!",1
11,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Outcast (TV Episode 1992)","An ambitious episode, but flaws diminish its overall impact","In my opinion, science fiction/fantasy is at its best when it offers an insight into the human condition. For Star Trek, this is no different as many of my favorite episodes and movies embody this to their core...by focusing on the characters and the aspects that made me as a viewer interested in their stories/arcs. This especially holds true when episodes focused more heavily on societal topics of interest. Next Generation's Season 5 episode ""The Outcast"" definitely aims to fit that mold, touching on the subject of LGBT relations. However, while the episode holds moments of note given the subject, it also presents the parameters of its premise in ways which detract from being truly memorable.A significant part of this comes from the setting focus itself. Much of the interaction regarding the conflict concerning the character of Soren and their/her attraction to First Officer Will Riker takes place among the crew of the Enterprise-D rather than the J'naii, the species of non-gender expressive individuals which the episode focuses on (which is a..weird choice considering that a species that has moved beyond focusing on gender shouldn't care about such categories, but maybe I'm missing something here). As a result, we are given more attention to what crew members like Riker and Beverly have to say about gender relations rather than the J'naii themselves. Cue the traditional comments of women being ""pretty, looking for protection"" while men are looking for ""strong or demur woman""...which provides the image of a Federation that doesn't consider the presence of LGBT individuals among their ranks. Such a thing is truly off-putting given where the episode is clearly aiming to go with its allegory. Such a thing might have been helped more with a focus directed on the J'naii, offering more of a critique of their discriminatory view of gender expression (again, a strange set-up given what I stated previously). That was more effectively put forth in ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"" in the Original Series of Star Trek, which focused on the subject of racial discrimination, and put more of a focus on the characters of Lokai and Bele and their intolerance for each other's differences as a center. As a result, when the time for the scene of moral attention arrives, put forth through a speech by Soren at their/her trial, it comes across more as an attempt rather than an embrace of its logic....which shouldn't be the case if a show decides to go with a more preachy, heavy-handed approach like this (which is opposite of the more subtle approach, like DS9's ""Rejoined"", which works out much better as a result) It doesn't help that the J'naii are overall soulless in their appearance or dictations, which compounds any measure of connecting to how they operate as a culture....to say nothing of how the ending makes no sense, as no longer identifying as female due to ""re-education"" by the J'naii doesn't mean Soren couldn't still love Riker (and of course the touchy subject of ""conversion therapy""). Yet another aspect that works against the allegory of the episode.I could get into other issues, such as the mischaracterization of Worf or how Soren is cast (I see no reason why they couldn't have just presented her as still genderless, yet falling for Riker...which could have allowed for more of a focus on the J'naii's ideas concerning gender expression), but I feel such a focus would be at risk of becoming nitpicky. For its flaws, the fact that Riker is cast as the crew member involved was a true boon...not just for the attempt of broadening the stakes of the episode, but also what it meant for me as a bisexual man. For someone like Riker, an individual that was portrayed on the show typically as a ladies man and a man of men, to be willing to enter into a relationship with an individual of a genderless culture and be willing to stake his entire career over it was truly impactful...not just by showing another dimension of Riker's character that the show didn't further explore (the typical result of single episodes) but also for how impressionable it was to a young man who had heard many cultural stereotypes over how LGBT men were not truly such. I definitely give the show's development team credit for embracing such a set-up, even if the focus of the episode diminished it...especially with the relationship between Riker and Soren itself lacking in chemistry.Overall, I give ""Outcast"" credit due to it being a part of Star Trek working to embrace a prosperous future that embraces peaceful differences of expression. If only it did that more clearly.",7
12,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Outcast (TV Episode 1992)",Poorly Crafted Episode/Riker Can't Keep His Pants On,"This works initially because the androgynous race is really interesting. I do take issue with the fact that this race is so clueless about conventional male/female roles. Most of the galaxy is probably made up of flora and fauna that function this way. Obviously, there is a mystery as to how this all works and the young Jenaii (Coren) is curious. This person eventually admits that the female side has established dominance. Riker begins to find ""her"" fascinating. It is explained to him how dangerous it is to admit that you gravitate one way or the other. Of course, Riker falls in love, letting his lust overcome his reason, endangering the person he now loves. Many Star Trek TNG episodes find Riker stomping around like a little boy, not getting his way. He has pushed the envelope on more than one occasion, ignoring PIcard's advice about the prime directive. There is a trial where Coren makes an impassioned speech about individual rights. She finishes and instead of making an impression, she is carted away to be ""fixed."" Riker tries to take the blame in one of his silly pathetic speeches, but he is ignored. The point is that he never used reasoning to look at the big picture of this world. He is responsible for taking away any chance that things could eventually change. So much erratic, improper behavior really diminishes this episode.",5

And it has its problems, particularly in the last few scenes, but I liked this because it was a love story. Riker falls for a member of an androgynous race (one who later proclaims her own femininity) and Frakes really sells it here; her importance to Will and his desperation to intervene when her superiors disapprove. And that's where it really has an effect. 7/10",7
14,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Outcast (TV Episode 1992)",Disappointing,"As others have said, this episode manages to be both preachy at times and a bit of a cop-out. And Soren was clearly hard to follow because she ... speaks ... so ... quickly, of course! At least one of Soren's monologues was long, not subtle at all, and had soporific effects.I am not sure how Riker could fall in love so quickly, and it seems unlikely that he and Worf would risk so much to attempt a rescue, being against the Prime Directive for starters and targeting someone whom Riker met only recently. Why is this love interest different from his others, in that it is apparently true love this time? Because it moves along the main (heavy-handed) story.That Riker was too late to stop the brainwashing was predictable. The technical subplot was a bit unrealistic as well; not sure why the Enterprise would sent its second in command on such a risky shuttle mission. I realize that Riker goes on many risky missions over the course of the show, but that doesn't mean that it makes sense. Apparently, in this case, it was necessary to move the main plot along as Riker apparently has limited time to fall in love!",4

But the questions asked by the character Soren during her trial in which she admits being female with urges from relationships with men are so similar to what LGBTQ people are forced by the majority heterosexual population today, and even more so when it first premiered. I am heterosexual, married, and a career military officer, but I am an LGBTQ ally. This show was one of a series of events that caused me to reevaluate how I thought of LGBTQ people and helped me become a better friend to my LGBTQ friends and relatives. The sad thing is that Soren's people reverse her progress and force her into what today would be called LGBTQ Conversion Therapy, something that is discredited and slowly but surely being outlawed in the United States.

It was swept under the rug or ignored, possibly because these writers thought it too controversial. It would have been a much better episode if sexuality had been dealt with in a more straightforward way. It's almost as if they wanted to do a show with this subject matter and were too frightened to actually follow through with what they started. You do not have to be a bleeding heart liberal to at least acknowledge different views on sexuality, but this was avoided, for some reason.As for Ryker not being able to keep his pants on, I find other episodes, even within this Season 5, where other Enterprise crew members, both male and female, can't keep their pants on either. I am not sure this episode really stood out because of this. Ryker always ""falls in love"" too easily.Skip this episode.

4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Cause and Effect (TV Episode 1992)",Typical Brannon Braga TNG Ep.,"On of his best actually - Despite my grief with Braga over destroying the Enterprise D ""Just Because it Didn't Fit well onto a 16:9 Widescreen Format""- and some of his other writing mistakes, he DID write a number of great STTNG eps. He never should have been elevated to Producer status. back when the Beimler/Manning team was producing the series, the show quality jumped to a high degree. Later, was was simply Berman/Braga and they drove the Trek universe into the ground. But this ep was made right before that happened - Braga was simply the story editor at this time, the series was enjoying it's highest peak at this point.Time Travel has been used in Trek since TOS. As a matter of fact, if some Trek ep got backed into a corner, they would always write some kind of Time anomaly to ""fix"" it.Regardless of this overuse of Time in the Trek 'Verse, this episode explores a unique idea: The idea of a Temporal Causality Loop - And so the Enterprise is stuck in a short loop of Time and are doomed to live it over, forever and ever, unless they can figure it out.There are some interesting things here: As Dr Crusher is attending her plants, she is humming a musical phrase, which subtly changes each time she sings it in each subsequent loop. And no matter what she does, she cannot seem to prevent a glass of wine from being knocked over - Even with foreknowledge of the accident. And due to this, we ask ourselves, will the Crew be able to actually MAKE a different choice, when the ""time"" comes? I think there was a DS9 or Babylon 5 ep that parodies this ep - actually it was a Stargate SG1 episode, ""Window of Opportunity"" which parodied this. But this ep came first. It is a rather disturbing episode, and there are subtle themes that change, some of them in small ways, but always, the events of the timeline always occur at the exact same time.And so this Ep deals with ""Foreknowledge and Predestination"", or Predestination vs Determinism.",10

Instead we see Dr Crusher, Data, Rika and Worf playing poker; it seems like another game but after winning Crusher states that she had a feeling Riker was bluffing; nothing abnormal though. She is then called away to treat Geordi and this time there is a stronger feeling of déjà vu. More strange events occur until the Enterprise encounters a space-time rift; moments later another ship emerges and despite using the tractor beam to deflect it they collide and the Enterprise explodes. We then return to the poker game only this time it isn't just Dr Crusher who has a feeling of déjà vu. The events play over and over; each time a little more is remembered but the end result is the same; they will have to find a way to send a message back in time to avoid the collision.This is a gripping episode that had me hooked from the moment it became clear that the destruction of the Enterprise wasn't a simulation. While we see the events several times they are sufficiently different that they don't seem overly repetitive. Details of what is happening emerge gradually; for example the voices Crusher hears and the reason Geordi was feeling unwell. The ultimate reason they are able to escape does seem a little far-fetched and it is a little surprising that they can remember the order cards are drawn in their game but can't recall what action led to the crash; still these are minor quibbles that one thinks about after watching rather than major problems.",8

Everything ends with Picard screaming, ""Abandon ship!"" Now everything goes back to the opening with the ship on its exploratory mission and everything happens again. Eventually, the poker players begin to feel like they know things, including the cards that will be dealt. Crusher knows she will be called to sick bay but can't explain why. She also knows ahead of time that Jordi will be there. Picard is reading a book, but believes he has read the first few chapters before. Crusher, at one point, records the voices and Data is able to hear Picard's screams to abandon ship. They must plot a strategy because they are sure they are in a time loop.

After a while, various crew-members (Dr. Crusher, mostly) feels the deja vu and try to sort things out. One reason why this episode is so effective is the writing; the repetition works because you want these people to put the pieces together and save the ship. The other is Frakes' direction, and he spices things up with different camera angles. But it's not as simple as just saving the day. What's causing the destruction is another ship having the same problem (captained by Kelsey Grammar in a nice bit role), except that while the Enterprise has been trapped for 17 days, they've been missing for 80 years(!).

However, on the way, the crew learns that Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton, in his second guest starring appearance after ""The Game"") and his squadron were involved in an accident where a cadet was killed.Trivia note: Robert Duncan McNeill plays Cadet First Class Nicholas Locarno (he will soon be a regular on Star Trek: Voyager).

1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The First Duty (TV Episode 1992)",Missed by so much,"This had the potential to be a great episode. They squandered the opportunity in favor of a ""feel good"" resolution in a fashion that has become well known in Star Trek fan circles. The set up is good, the dialogue and the mystery are plausible. I liked it, maybe loved it, up til maybe 3/4 through. But then... they pulled their punch. They set up some truly wrenching decisions for Wesley and his friends, but never deliver any real price for making the hard choices. Finally, Wesley is in an adult world where he is not just the helpful boy wonder. He's adrift, with no clear guidance on what to do. In fact, some of that past has put him here. He's so accustomed to being an overachiever that it bites him badly here, and he needs guidance. Consequences for his actions, negative ones, are at hand and right in front of him. And then ... they aren't. He suffers some personal anguish and embarrassment, maybe, but no more. He comes down a few pegs in the eyes of his mother and Picard. Then everyone goes back to work. In short, the writers forgot the story was set in a serious legal and military situation and decided to save a beloved character instead. They treated negligence, insubordination, and manslaughter like schoolboy infractions. He killed a fellow student, so he had to repeat some courses and everyone would know. Boo Hoo. This wasn't (merely) cheating - a man was DEAD due to willful disobedience. If THAT isn't a near capital honors violation, what would be? Wesley had violated a known standing order, knowingly put himself and others at risk of their lives, got someone killed as a result, then lied about it repeatedly. His punishment is to spend another year at one of the finest schools in the Federation? He should have been facing jail time. Expulsion should have been the least of his worries. Pathetic.",5
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The First Duty (TV Episode 1992)",No clear solution,"I love episodes like this where there is no obviously correct solution. (Some of the original series were like this, where Kirk will violate the prime directive for the ""good"" of a society that was doing alright as it was.)And conflicting loyalties. Do we follow the rules or try to cause the least harm?Picard and Wesley are usually presented in the series as being without fault. To see them weaker created an episode I was thinking about days later.** Warning: Minor spoilers belowRight after Wesley's predicament is laid out, a conversation with the Academy elder (the gardener) reveals that Picard had done something that was worthy of expulsion. The elder had protected Picard to some extent; the writers leave ambiguity as to whether it was defense (if he was a gardener then, it couldn't have been much) or a full cover up.This small scene sets the focus for the episode, and (for me) sets up Picard to be a hypocrite later as he gives Wesley a sermon about duty to truth. (Others take the focus to be the statement ""made sure you listened to yourself"", which is just as valid, but less interesting.) Was Picard's ""doing what was right"" protect his fellows?Wesley's character too is impinged as we learn he has done something banned by the Academy, something unnecessary and risky that has in the past caused others to lose their lives.The Corrupter"" (and what I remember of ""Miller's Crossing"") are films I loved with a similar theme. Cops in a completely corrupt environment. If they take out the bad guy another will rise. Do they try to make an incremental improvement though they will become corrupt themselves?",9
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The First Duty (TV Episode 1992)",The Secret Origin of Thomas Eugene Paris,"This is another Episode that bothered me, but not because it was a bad episode.It is because, for the first time in Next Generation, Wesley Crusher is shown to be simply Human, and is put into a spot where he has to decide, ""Do I keep my mouth shut and support my Leader Tom Paris... Er, I mean 'Nick Locarno'... and Picard will never trust me again in this lifetime, or do I tell the TRUTH right from the start?"" I think this episode, despite my personal discomfort watching it, hits at the core of what Star Trek is all about. Our FIRST DUTY is to The Truth, however painful it might be to tell it, regardless of our feelings toward our crew mates and class mates, we MUST tell the Truth. That does not mean that there are not some times to withhold truth, that's called basic ""tact"" - But there are times to tell it right away. This idea even rises out of our TV sets and DVD players or SmartPhones, whatever we are using to watch this series, into our real lives. I think many of us might have had something similar happen to us. That is what makes this an episode to not pan or pass on.I can accept Ensign/Cadet Crusher being ambivalent about this, he had developed a pattern of successes on The Enterprise that was leading toward an opportunity for command, which at this point in the series, was what the character wanted.And we finally get to meet ""Boothby"" for the first time, portrayed by the great Ray Walston of ""South Pacific"", ""Kiss Me Stupid"", and ""My Favorite Martian"". And it is Boothby who states it: ""Nick Locarno is leader, mentor, best friend and even surrogate father to those kids - He would do anything for them and they would do anything to support him, even if it requires jumping off a cliff"".This type of Cadet/Leader is even mirrored in the Deep Space Nine episode ""Valiant"" where a personality much like Locarno had been put in charge of a Defiant-Class Starship. ""Captain"" Tim Watters might have been the same to his ""Red Squad"" cadets as Locarno was to his ""Nova Squadron"" - But that DS9 episode shows the worst case scenario. Here, Picard is able to intervene before it gets to that point.Locarno's ""Nova Squadron"" was not as large as Watter's Red Squad, so we get to see more of each member as they have to decide if they are going to tell the Truth or not. And they all would have lied to save their skins, had not Picard confronted Crusher.And Picard knew how to Fine-Tune Crusher to get him to comply, by dangling Crusher's own values over a precipice. We know that what Picard thinks is what concerns Wesley the most, and therein lies the answer.Look for Shannon Fill to reprise Ensign Sito Jaxa in the Season 7 episode ""Lower Decks"" along with Jeri Taylor's son Alex Engberg as ""Taurik"" - Who may be Vorick's identical twin brother from Voyager. I only started understanding recently why they can't use these names - Tom Paris was supposed to be Locarno and Vorick was supposed to be Taurik - But they would have had to pay Jeri Taylor or Ronald D Moore for every episode those characters appear in. It's an unfortunate truth about TV shows and why characters get their names changed occasionally.",10
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The First Duty (TV Episode 1992)",Lies and dishonour,"As the Enterprise heads back to Earth so Picard can give a speech a Star Fleet Academy they receive news that Wesley Crusher has been involved in a serious accident. He got away with a few repairable injuries but another cadet lost his life. As the inquiry gets underway the cadets explain how they were flying in a five ship formation when the dead cadet's shuttle came out of position causing a collision that the others were lucky to survive. To help get to the bottom of what happened Picard runs a parallel investigation aboard the enterprise and it isn't long before it becomes clear that there are flaws in the cadets' evidence. Finding the truth won't be easy though; the group is tight knit and led by Nicholas Locarno, a cadet who is highly respected by the others in the squadron. Ultimately there is no cast iron proof but all the evidence suggests that the cadets have been lying to cover up the fact they were attempting manoeuvre that is so dangerous it has been banned for a century.This is a very interesting episode; in the past Star Fleet officers have been portrayed as noble pursuers of the truth; there may have been the occasional bad egg but no major character would get involved would lie to protect their own position. Here though it soon becomes clear that Wesley is involved in one of the worst lies possible; he seems willing to let a dead friend take the blame for the accident to protect the rest of the group. Wil Wheaton has certainly matured in the role as he portrays this conflicted character. This episode is notable for introducing Robert Duncan McNeill to the Star Trek universe; here he plays Locarno, a character not that dissimilar to the character Tom Paris he plays in 'Star Trek: Voyager'. We also get to meet Boothby, the Academy gardener and old friend of Picard for the first time. As the story progresses it nicely portrays the conflict between loyalty to one's group and one duty to tell the truth no matter what the personal costs and this leads to the episodes one real flaw; the costs seem surprisingly mild given that the squadron lied to an inquiry about an event so serious that it left one of them dead.

But back in season 4, in The Wounded, he ignores the truth about the Cardasians preparing to go to war and instead let's another Starfleet officer see his career go down in flames. He made a big speech about he didn't back up Captain Maxwell's claims because he wanted to avoid a war.

He and a group of cadets were involved in an accident where one of their team's members was killed and one of the dominant members of the group, Nick (Robert Duncan McNeill) pressures Wesley and the rest to lie to the board of inquiry. Why? What are they hiding? Wesley isn't forthcoming about why...so it's up to Picard to figure out what REALLY happened.This episode makes Wesley look pretty bad. While he ultimately does do the right thing, he is a lying weasel during much of the show and you really don't like or respect him in this one. Because of this, the show is a bit of a letdown. However, it is interesting and worth seeing.By the way, Robert Duncan McNeill later was a regular on ""Star Trek: Voyager"".

Something has gone dreadfully wrong and young cadet has paid with his life. Picard is on his way to deliver the commencement address at the Starfleet Academy. Wesley Crusher was part of an intergalactic Blue Angels kind of synchronized flight crew. He is led by the man who would later be Ensign Paris on ""Voyager."" That character is a bit of a loose cannon as well, but the arrogance of the leader as he lies at the inquest shows the worst part of peer pressure. Wesley falls for the guy's line but is filled with guilt. The reason for the death is that this pilot was in over his head; he shouldn't have been asked to do what he did. It takes everything Picard can do to get his Wunderkind to finally fess up for his actions. When he finally does, it's after a string of lies and coverups by him and his colleagues. Apparently, the sentence is to force him to repeat a year at the Academy. The whole group should have been expelled, considering the severity of the result of their actions. Totally out of character, Locarno takes the entire responsibility on himself and tries to exonerate the rest. This may have worked initially, but once they tried to cover things up, that should have been it. The rules for entrance into this Academy are probably as stringent as it is possible and they have betrayed everyone. It just fizzles so badly at the end. I suppose they thought they might need Wesley's character at some future time.",5

jackpot at the Academy. His flying squad is the subject of an investigation
involving the death of one of its members.The dead cadet is the son of a StarFleet officer Ed Lauter much like Wil Wheaton
is the son of a man who was killed on active duty. But there is a wall of silence
like in our police forces today and in this case it is enforced by the leader of
Wheaton's squadron Robert Duncan McNeill.No doubt McNeill's performance here led to his being cast as Tom Paris in the
Star Trek Voyager. Paris is something of a bad boy though nowhere as reckless as his character here.Ray Walston appears as groundskeeper Boothby sort of a father confessor to
the cadets. He has an important scene with Patrick Stewart who values his
opinion and his counsel. Imagine his character decades earlier as Lionel
Barrymore's in Navy Blue And Gold and you have some idea of Walston's
relationship to the cadets.The key scene is Stewart and Wheaton who reminds him of his duty and how
he's letting all on the Enterprise down who invested hopes and dreams in him.Do you doubt Wesley Crusher does the right thing?",8

This was atypical of his previous Mary Sue behavior and realistic that he was very influenced by Picard's sure opinion.There are no right or wrong things to do in this episode, it was a moral dilemma. And it was shown beautifully.It was an absolute disappointment when Wesley disrupted the closing of the case and came out with the truth, but the climax where nobody glorifies him for coming out, and that it is seen as a bad thing by his peers, and he has to pay for it, makes up for it.

This is all about Wesley; his guilt, self-doubt and ultimately his reconciliation with the truth during a hearing over a flight accident. I do like that this has him painted in an unsavory light and there's an effort here to show him struggling against expectation and peer pressure. His implied father/son relationship with the Captain is truly put to the test here (resulting in one of the great - and wrathful - Picard speeches).There's a ray of hope in the end, but with serious restrictions.Yeah, I'd say this episode has grown on me.7/10",7

As Locarno said, all Wesley had to do was lie and it would just be their word against Picard's. Sure, Wesley would have felt guilt, but it would have subsided and it wouldn't have meant ruining Locarno's career (not to mention the incident being on the permanent records of the rest of the squadron). The rest of the squadron was able to avoid expulsion merely because Locarno pleaded for it, making him loyal, unlike the perfidious Wesley.If there wasn't a reason to dislike the goody-two-shoes Wesley in the previous episodes, there certainly is now.",

She immediately inserts herself in the crew's business, particularly when it comes to her daughter. Two things are going on prior to the wedding. Alexander is experiencing anger with his authoritarian father, Worf, who sets down rules and expects them to be followed to the letter. Also, after breaking up an asteroid before it does significant damage to a planet, some of the residue finds its way on ship and begins to combine with structural metals, turning them into a syrupy goop. It turns out that the guy set to marry Lwaxana is a boorish, puffed up, self centered jerk. He has a man with him who is his chief of protocol. He is prissy and full of himself also and doesn't buy into this wedding. Anyway, as Troi tries to council Alexander, her mother keeps butting in (actually, offering much better advice). Troi has all the jargon that we hear from counselors today. Her mother is much more about using what it takes to deal with life. This is more of a lightweight episode although the stuff affecting the ship is quite serious.",7
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Cost of Living (TV Episode 1992)","Luwaxana and Alexander, two unlikely cronies","And this episode had me in stitches as it had Worf and Troi and Third Minister Campio in convulsions and knots.Worf is having difficulties getting Alexander to start taking life seriously, therein lies the problem. Where Worf is great at planning Battle Tactics or Photon Torpedo configurations, he cannot handle one small Klingon/Human Boy, he never expected to have to. And he would not have had to, had Kehy'Ler lived. But Alexander is Worf's responsibility now, and where they both hurt from the loss of Keyh'Ler, the have to learn how to take solace in each other. But it is difficult, Worf is such a Party-Pooper. Even Guinan says so, she's seen other Klingons laugh, just not Worf.So this episode is important for that developing story of Worf and Alexander- Luwaxana just happens to show up right when Alexander needs her the most.And I have to admit something also, I also did not like the Luwaxana character that much - Until this episode.I had to realize, this was Gene's wife, who had been part of this show ever since she was the original ""Number One"" in the first Star Trek Pilot ""The Cage"". So - WHY was she driving me nuts in every Next Generation episode? I think it was because, she was not acting, she was playing herself. And that was it. I am honored to have communicated to her in several emails in the 90's, when I was discussing her ""Earth: Final Conflict"" show that she created from one of Gene's old ideas. Luwaxana is who Majel is, so once I accepted that, I was able to accept Troi's eccentric but talented Mother. Even when she showed up chasing Odo on Deep Space 9.This episode has Luwaxana times three, pulling out all of the stops. The wackiness and audacity of commandeering the Enterprise D to hold her Wedding to a Stuffed-Shirt nobility figure Tony Jay (""The Supreme Being"" from 'Time Bandits') as Third Minister Campio, which was obnoxious enough! She had nothing in common with that guy, no disrespect to his position intended! But then she steps right in and commandeers Alexander. And that they both had fun despite Worf and Campio's interference, or even our interference.Meanwhile, there is some Conundrum-Goop eating the electrical components of the ship, that adds a bit of tension.But what makes it is the final scene, where Luwaxana shows up in the ""traditional"" Betazoid ""garb"" for weddings.

This isn't necessarily a complaint, though, as these shows are also rather fun...as there really is no one like Lwaxana!The show begins with Worf and Alexander working out their troubled relationship with the help of Counselor Troi. Worf is bossy and cold and Alexander isn't very obedient. However, their progress in counseling is lost when Lwaxana shows up--and she practically kidnaps the boy--taking him off on her holodeck adventures. At the same time, Lwaxana is SUPPOSED to be preparing for a wedding to a very dull man--one who is nothing like the free-spirited Lwaxana. Are Lwaxana's and Alexander's stories really THAT different?This one is played just for laughs. It's got a few and I did enjoy the final scene with Worf, Deanna, Lwaxana and Alexander.

Instead we see two interlinked character stories; in the first Worf is having difficulties with his son Alexander and is getting advice from Counsellor Troi and in the second Troi's mother, Lwaxana is aboard the Enterprise preparing to marry a man she has never met. The stories collide when Lwaxana takes it upon herself to help Alexander. Needless to say neither Worf nor Lwaxana's daughter are impressed. When we are introduced to Lwaxana's fiancé it becomes instantly clear that he is her polar opposite. When the danger first hinted at in the opening scene comes to notice we learn that it is a 'space parasite' that eats a certain metal which features in many of the Enterprise's vital systems. It will be touch and go whether there can return to the mineral rich asteroid belt before it is too late.This is a fairly light weight episode; the metal eating parasites which threatens the ship is very much secondary to Lwaxana and Alexander's stories. Whether you enjoy this story will of course depend on what we think of these two very different characters; I tend to find the free-spirited Lwaxana entertaining but in the past Alexander has just been annoying. Early on I feared he would continue to be annoying but thankfully once he started hanging around with Lwaxana he became far more entertaining. The scenes where they relax on the holodeck were particularly fun. Lwaxana's upcoming wedding provided some entertainment too; her fiancé was clearly wrong for her which provided good comedy as he was surprised by her lack of protocol and is utterly horrified by her decision to eschew the wedding dress of his people for the nakedness of her own race's marriage custom! Majel Barrett does a great job as Lwaxana; a real force of nature. When the parasites become apparent there is some drama although I doubt anybody will think the problem won't be resolved.

I had some idea of what the story was about from the IMDb synopsis but still it way exceeded my expectation. The story is typical until the very end where there is a surprising and tragic twist.. when Picard realized how his moments of kindness had unwittingly doomed another person to live out the rest of her life in tragic consequence.This might just become one of the few Star Trek TV episodes that will stay with me for a very long time.

1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Perfect Mate (TV Episode 1992)",Kamala's fate has echoes of Sita?,"Anyone interested in this ""tragic"" aspect of the Kamala character doing her duty should read the Ramayana and ponder over Sita's fate. We see that Kamala happily goes to her fate, though it seems to us sad for her and Picard. Once she has bonded ""accidentally"" with Picard, who is a man whose highest principle is his duty, she can then fulfill her duty also, knowing she can do it regardless of whether she is personally happy. I am reminded of the way Sita embraces her Dharma (duty) in the Indian epic the Ramayana. Sita represents so much more than the single episode Star Trek character Kamala: Sita loves Rama totally and follows him into exile in the forest, gladly proving her honor once she is freed from the demon Ravana, and so on, yet in the final episode she is swallowed up again by her Mother Earth, after denying a romantic ""happily ever after"" ending. The Ramayana is one of the greatest epics of all time, anywhere, and one wonders if the writers of this STNG episode had Sita in mind. It is rare to find contemporary female characters who encompass so much understanding, who are with men, but also have their own agency. With such a denouement in this STNG episode, one senses that the Kamala character hints at a female agency that is strong and independent, while still apparently fulfilling a role subservient to males.",9
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Perfect Mate (TV Episode 1992)",Excellent Episode Featuring the Complexities of Picard,"A ""metamorph,"" who is someone groomed from childhood to serve a purpose, arrives on the Enterprise.

Two Ferengi nincompoops trying to kidnap her. knocking over her stasis chamber, forcing her to involve herself with the crew before she is really ready. She has the incredible ability to bond with men by being whatever they want her to be. It's very sexy and a bit dangerous. Riker is immediately taken in (surprise, surprise) but manages to keep his distance. Even Worf growls when she growls at him. Picard, doing everything he can to avoid interaction with her, becomes her soul-mate. He has such character and purpose that he is able to overcome his baser instincts and resist her. Still, they have encounters where he tries to let her know that as a sentient being, she should have rights. She tells him that this is her reason for existence. The scenes between the two of them are wonderful, tension abounding. Sadly, the guy she is to hook up with is a self-centered bureaucrat with no sentimentality or joyfulness. The Ferengi, in their efforts to do business with the escort/negotiator, almost kill him, and Picard must carry on the encounter with the two forces.

3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Perfect Mate (TV Episode 1992)",Can Picard resist the 'perfect' woman?,"Once again the Enterprise is involved in the end of a conflict; this time by transporting Ambassador Briam, representative of the Kryotion people, and his gift to a formal meeting with the representative from Valt Minor. It should be a routine but along the way the Enterprise rescues a pair of Ferengi not realising their situation was engineered to get them aboard the Enterprise to steal the ambassador's gift. Their plan fails but it does lead to the gift becoming unboxed. This leads to a dilemma for Picard as the gift is in fact a woman. She is Kamala, a very rare metamorph. Metaporth's have an empathic ability to detect men's desires and respond to them; they are also highly alluring making it hard for men not to throw themselves at her. When the ambassador is injured Picard must fill in and this means spending a long time with Kamala and the more he tries to avoid giving into her attractions the more fascinated she becomes with him.This might not be an action packed episode but it is an interesting story nonetheless. With the arrival of the two Ferengis I thought we were going to get a more light-hearted episode but once Kamala appears things get more serious. There is the inevitable discussion of the rights and wrongs of transporting a sentient being to be given as a gift; even if that being has no objection and even sees it as their purpose in life. Kamala's allure leads to some fun moments as she affects Riker, a group of miners and even Worf. However it is her scenes with Picard that are most interesting as he strives to ignore her charms. All this leads up to an ending that isn't exactly happy but it is the right resolution to my mind even if it isn't quite what most viewers will want. Famke Janssen does a solid job as Kamala and Patrick Stewart is on top form in their scenes together. Overall a solid character driven episode.",8
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Perfect Mate (TV Episode 1992)",Turned out a lot more interesting than I expected,"I apologize in advance that this will not so much be a review of this episode, as it is my opinion of what is wrong with the way many seem to be watching and rating TV shows and movies nowadays.As for the episode itself, it was better than I expected from the single-sentence summary I read before watching it. The story has a tragic aspect to it, because it involves a woman who was specifically raised with the sole purpose of being nothing but a gift, to be handed over during the signing of a peace treaty. The story ends with a rather unexpected twist that makes it all the more tragic. What makes the episode particularly nice, is that it gives us a more personal look into Picard's personage than we're generally used to. Despite the serious subject matter, there are quite a bit of humorous scenes to lighten it up. Highly recommended.Now, as I stated before, my only expectations of this episode were based on a single sentence that summarizes the plot. For the rest I know I am watching an early nineties show with a mid-sized budget and a tight schedule. I am fully aware it is not as refined as present-day shows written by people who studied all the flaws in all older shows in televised history. Therefore I do not expect the same rigor. There was a particular moment in this episode where I thought: ""boy, that is some poor security for a 24th-century space ship."" However, it was obvious that this part of the story was completely secondary to the main subject, therefore I immediately ignored it under suspension of disbelief. When going through the other reviews however, I find another recent one that completely disses the entire episode just because of that exact same shortcut in the plot.Yes, a Ferengi simply walking into a cargo bay that was earlier on explicitly requested to have increased security, is sloppy writing. But no, this does not break the entire episode as the reviewer insinuates. Maybe if this episode would have been released today this would be unacceptable, but it is 24 years old. If you're going to apply present-day expectations to something from a quarter century ago, it may be better not to watch it at all.This is not the first time I bump into a review like that. Even beyond TV and movie reviews I notice this same kind of behavior being on the march: creating completely unreasonable expectations based on either incomplete information or inappropriate frames-of-reference, or both; and then being extremely disappointed when those expectations are not perfectly met. That is one sure way to be disappointed with pretty much everything. If you want to go back to enjoying things, make minimal assumptions about them. Take things for what they are, not what you thought them to be based on whatever rigid models or misleading advertisements (like movie trailers, which I avoid if I can). Of course, whoever wants to turn themselves into a complete sourpuss, is free to ignore this advice, but I would appreciate it if one would not try to spread this kind of acidity across the world.",9

To makes this work, you need an actress of magnetic attraction (the alluring Famke Janssen, check). . . as well as that Starfleet office who's duty-bound to resist her appeal. This is a Picard episode if ever there was one, and it's a great character study that focuses on the man and not the Prime Directive-citing Captain we're used to.

There had always been someone around to educate her in something.Having a mate like this would demand a man like Picard to make drastic changes in his life. He would always have to bring her along on his travels or settle down and pursuing a career. With at spouse as beautiful and devoted as Kamala this would at first seem tempting, but what happens when there's nothing more for Kamala to learn from Picard. It's hard to believe a woman like her would settle down in a relationship. The character of Kamala might be designed in a way so this scenario never occurs and explain the bonding theme, but she does say that she's still an empath and will be able to give the ambassador the happiness thats part of deal between the two parts in the conflict even though she says she has fallen for Picard. Again i wonder if she says this because it's the truth or because it's precisely what she knows Pichard wants to hear.I think Picard, being an intelligent and self controlled man, realizes the eneveteable doom a relationship with Kamala represents. While he's tempted by the incredible beauty of Kamala and her apparent promise of a long and happy life should he choose her, he also somehow knows that he can never be satisfied with a spouse that does not bring anything new to the relationship.In my time i have meet a couple of women with this exact personality. An almost perfect ability to adapt to whatever group of people they were in. Like the character of Kamala this ability always freaked me out. I don't remember i have ever come across a movie that described this ability as loving and loyal to the woman as this episode of Star Trek does. It's by far the best i have seen./Svend Erik",10

They run the security of the ship, a quasi-military ship, with less rigor than a college frat party. I know that in this instance it moved the plot along that they let a couple of Ferengi loose on the ship, but the sloppiness of it really spoils the rest of the episode. They could have accomplished the same effect in a different way if they had thought about the plot for another twenty minutes, but that seems too much to ask.

But Kamala was most unusual, able to get a rise even out of Worf who is usually immune to women. She was probably frustrated by Data, but so is everyone else so that's nothing new. Thanks to Data, who tries to protect her from the attentions of Three Miners who try to turn her into a Party Girl. One Growl from Worf and they run. Too Bad. But it was interesting to see the depiction of a woman whose personality changes according to the men she is around, we just WISH there were a real woman that was like this. But I'll bet there are women who would not mind a man who could do it too. But the concept is a form of cheating, negating the work it takes to achieve a real relationship. Oh, we'd LIKE it to be as easy as she makes it seem. But it is not.Unforeseen Circumstances put her side by side with Picard, who is also usually immune to women. But as boring as he tries to be, he fails. Too late! It could have only been Picard. If it had been anyone else, Riker, she would have called the whole ceremony off and continued the war that was started by a woman like her in the first place. Or Kirk! What if it had been Kirk, the Dolman of Elaas was nothing compared to Kamala! We see Max Grodénchik as yet another Ferengi, but not ""Rom"" yet. And of course, the Ferengi's nosy snooping cause a lot of problems for Picard: as usual.The resolution of this tale is the only way it could have happened, but the only other one who knows it is Ambassador Briam (Tim O'Connor), who was chosen for one reason: He was 200 years old!

I thought the plot was good and so was the acting. Some scenes were predictable but if you watch a TV series for a few years, you're usually able to do that. While watching this episode I found myself wondering have I grown up to the point where I have forgotten how children can view adults and our adult rules. I find it amusing that the alien energy force decided to take the form of a little girl (Isabella) and although she has the power to become invisible, tamper with the starship's navigation and control systems, she still did not understand human adult behavior. I think there are big lessons here. One can be intelligent but not sophisticated. One can be skilled technically but still lack maturity. Another lesson is, humans are complex. We can not rightly judge a person by merely watching them. We need to interact with them. We need to pay more attention to our children. Oftentimes, they are telling us the truth.

Read on)","One of the original ideas - and one of the dumbest, and, mercifully, mostly ignored - was the crew of the Enterprise, would have their families. LOVE BOAT in space.Roddenberry realized quickly, this was not an 'entertaining' idea to continually follow, and, after it's initial season, the idea was mostly relegated to the back burner.Except here.There are very few children who can ACT. What most of them do, is look 'cute,' and, in this episode, that's what we're handed. IMAGINARY FRIEND - is one of the few episodes that follows a moppet aboard ENTERPRISE, and, her 'invisible' friend.As I said, there are very few children who can act. Such names as Patty McCormack, Billy Mumy come to mind, but, not here. It's following the other form of kid 'acting,' - cute, wooden, 'lispy-talk,' and, while I've a low tolerance for 'cute,' in general, it makes trying to stomach it - for an hour, is almost unbearable.This annoyance is the major focus of this episode. The 'story's really a 'fish out of water' tale, with Clara's 'invisible' friend becoming an alien, who can't understand why 'humans' (more accurately, adults') can be so 'mean' to kids.This would play much better as an ABC After-School special, but, it is so myopic, and its script, so hit-over-the-head-with-a-hammer type, that, it's barely watchable.Years ago, another sci-fi show, the often mocked LOST IN SPACE (shut up!) did a GREAT episode (it was the first season, before it became so campy, so ridiculous), about a chlld's loneliness.That episode, MY FRIEND, MR. NOBODY, was a wonderfully acted, and scripted (!) variation of this idea, where Penny Robinson feels neglected, and, spends her time with Mr. Nobody.Like this STAR TREK episode, the adults did not believe Mr. Nobody was anything more than a child's imagination, but, it soon became apparent, he was real, and, as here, he also is angered at how the others treat Penny.Angela Cartwright was a much better actress, than this girl, but, additionally, the ending of that episode was so beautifully handled, that, even now, it still stands out.As for this episode, of STTNG...it was a throw-away then, and that's where it should stay.",

She eats with her friend and talks with her to the point her father calls in Troi to intervene. So when some force (as usual, a kind of Tinkerbell of light, enters the ship, it takes on the role of her friend. Apparently, she is visible to anyone who happens to be around when she shows up, but the bad, mean Enterprise crew forgets what it is like to be a child. This ""child"" proves to be a bad seed and has designs on the engineering section. She becomes furious, threatening the lives of the crew. She is annoyed that the little girl, Clara, can't do whatever she wants. She is domineering and pushy and possessive, yet she decides to punish them. She is part of a force in the nebula that is investigating the worthiness of the crew. Are all of them merely children, shortsighted and selfish.

It seems he's worried that she has some imaginary friend, but Troi assures him that this is normal and he should just go with it! However, a bit later, the girl's friend comes to life for real--and this 'friend' is a bit of a jerk. In fact, when Clara goes off to play by herself later, the friend informs Clara that she's going to killer her along with the rest of the people on the ship! Some friend!So why is this one so bad?

Then, shortly after entering a nebula, a small glowing ball of energy enters the ship, approaches Clara and suddenly becomes Isabella. Clara is a little surprised but not too perturbed that she can now see Isabella. Soon Clara starts getting into trouble as Isabella encourages her to go to parts of the ship where children aren't allowed; each time they are in an area with other people Isabella disappears. Wanting to avoid trouble Clara starts doing things away from Isabella and this leads to unpleasant threats.Like many child centred episodes this one is a bit of a disappointment; the final message of the episode is that adults set rules about what children can do to protect them but if that is the case why are they allowed to live on a star ship that encounters danger on such a regular basis?! Even though Shay Astar is suitably creepy as Isabella she isn't really scary and Clara seems far too ready to accept that her imaginary friend just became real. The threat from the other entities in the nebula is perhaps appropriately nebulous there was little real sense of danger even after Isabella told Clara that they would kill everybody on board.

Disconnected from the Borg, this one, which has been named Hugh, starts developing an individual identity and emotions.At the same time, Picard and crew devise a plan to introduce a virus into Hugh to spread to the others in the collective, thereby shutting them down permanently (a plan that is used in the end episode of Star Trek: Voyager).

Of course this has been the case in many episodes but this particular one takes it one step further.The acting in this episode was somewhat better then usual as well, there were more feelings there than usually displayed by characters like Laforge for example. And Jonathan del Arco did really good playing the lost Borg (Very good considering how bad guest actors there are in many other episodes).Finally the greatest reason to why i liked this episode so much was because of the greater question. Is a individual that always been controlled by something greater than himself still an individual? It's kind of poetical just as the title ""I, Borg"".",9

5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" I Borg (TV Episode 1992)",A Horrible Idea,"Of all the characters on this series, the one I find the most tiresome is Beverly Crusher. She has this thing about the sacredness of life, which is fine, but she is also willing to allow something that has killed billions of life forms and wiped out whole civilizations, including a close encounter with earth, to come on board. The syrupy way this whole thing unfolds, with characters whose families and friends have been assimilated by these things falling lovingly for this menace, drove me crazy. Disagree with the idea of destroying the collective, but don't embrace this horror. On numerous occasions, Beverly has used her own prejudices and views to push people around, including Picard (who really disappoints me when she is around). Anyway, I'm getting all upset (I guess this is only a fictional series) so I shouldn't get so passionate, but it does portend to speak for a compassionate world, putting aside the foibles of previous civilizations. I'm waiting for Beverly to come on board and say, ""Oh, I think the Romulans are really a good hearted people"" as they fire on the enterprise. This Borg is bringing with it a huge threat to all living things, where they will continue, bee-like, at the center of the galaxy, with nothing left around them.",6

Bringing this kid on-board the ship ignites the debate among the crew: use him to implant a virus into the collective or help resuscitate the human trapped within? And I can see both sides. The horrors these automatons have wreaked are still fresh in the crew's memories; but physicians have an innate desire to heal, so Dr. Crusher has a point. In the end, everyone )after vigorous struggle) comes around and sees Hugh as a chance to inject some individuality into the hive. And that's what makes this a great episode; the ray of hope emerging from bitter spite. In some ways, it's a classic tale of disarming hardened perceptions and adds substance to a cleaver (albeit one- dimensional) foe. Above all, it's an episode that leaves a lasting impression.8/10",8
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" I Borg (TV Episode 1992)",A chance to eliminate the Borg,"When the Enterprise responds to a signal they suspect might be a distress signal the crew is presented with a dilemma; the signal is coming from an injured Borg. There are those who believe it should be killed on the spot, Dr Crusher believes that it is her duty to heal any injured being and Picard who sees this as an opportunity to eliminate the Borg. Picard believes that by repairing this one drone and installing a virus the entire collective would soon be eliminated and thus end the greatest threat that humanity has faced. The Borg is brought back aboard the Enterprise and clearly is uncomfortable as it is cut off from the collective. While working on the Borg Geordi starts to talk to it and notices a growing sense of individuality and questions the captain's plans; is the drone, who has been given the name Hugh, merely part of the collective or is he an individual with rights? Perhaps these changes will affect the Borg in a way that won't require their elimination.This is an interesting episode which raises the question of what it is acceptable to do in war; in this case is it acceptable to eliminate the Borg in their entirety. They aren't like ordinary enemies as there are no civilians and as a collective they can be viewed as a single parasite which is a threat to the galaxy. Of course it isn't quite as simple as that as we see a sense of individuality develop in Hugh and of course it would be a shame to get rid of one of Star Trek's most menacing villains. Guest star Jonathan Del Arco puts in a fine performance as Hugh and Whoopi Goldberg is great as Guinan; it was nice to see her character having more to do than offering words of advice as she fences with Picard and explaining her views on the Borg. Overall a really good episode which shows there doesn't need to be an immediate threat to provide an interesting episode.",9

I plan to watch the others but they may not have as much interest without my favorite star trek team. All this aside, I love this episode. Easily one of my favorites.

9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" I Borg (TV Episode 1992)",A goof of this episode,"This comment is to be considered a goof of the episode since there were not any others mentioned I think this one does merit a mention since the Borg are considered a collective and speak as a group and consider themselves all as one and not individuals.Just before Geordi and Dr.Crusher give the Borg a name he asks them ""Do I have a name?"" which is so clearly and easily recognizable of being improper Borg terminology I find it interesting they overlooked it.Properly spoken, the Borg would have naturally said ""Do We have a name?"" but the episode was left as is and distributed with what I consider to be a rather large slip-up in proper format of a recurring alien character(s) such as the Borg.",7
10,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" I Borg (TV Episode 1992)",Special Interesting info on the Borg,"The ""Borg"" idea was inspired by studying the real life character by the name of Broden Borg who always tries to get everyone around him to assimilate with what Broden wants them to do. Resistance is futile ! The Captain of the Enterprise tried to get Data to erase the ""Broden Borg"" from the memory banks but couldn't leading to the plasma conducts becoming blocked. Troy believed the only way to remove the ""Broden Borg"" from the Enterprise was to place the ""Broden Borg"" on top of the warp coils, but the ""Broden Borg"" was too strong ranting and raving about it's own self worthiness resulting in Data blowing a circuit. Most Trekies don't realize that the ""Broden Borg"" is far more dangerous than the ""Borg"" on their own. 9 out of 10 for this one.",9

0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Next Phase (TV Episode 1992)",One of my personal favourites.,"One of my personal favourites. You may think why, well I just think there's something special bout it. I mean sure the technical stuff hardly make any sense, but who cares. Also it brings us slighter into the mind of Ro Laren, a character we don't see to much of. Also it's funny what a good duo her and Geordi can be, since he most of the time is in ""Data episodes"".The special effects also impressed me much the first time I saw this episode. I mean Star Ttrek have tried something similar before, but it has never looked so good. It looks incredibly real, and except for one slip off, the episodes effects are almost flawless, and pretty good even by todays standards.I love the tension that is build up in this episode. With the Romilans plans, and the ""you know who"" guy ( I don't like to spoil thing) just makes this and incredible exiting episode. And since Tasha dies, we all feel that main characters dying aren't that unfeasible, so were always slightly worried about what will happen next.It is just an exiting episode, with a great ending (I don't get Geordi's joke though)and great special effects. This is what Star Trek is for me, good character relations, and a weird problem to be solved within a time limit. It's just plane fun to watch. I give this episode a 9/10.",9
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Next Phase (TV Episode 1992)",Is there life after death?,"ST:TNG:124 - ""The Next Phase"" (Stardate: 45854.2) - this is the 24th episode of the 5th season of Star Trek: The Next Generation.This episode is one of my very favorites of the entire TNG run, and of all Star Trek itself. It deals with the issue of ""is there life after death?"", ""what is death?"", ""what does death really mean?"" - and in my opinion, in a very scientifically plausible way.After the Enterprise responds to a Romulan distress signal, Geordi and Ro Laren (another appearance by Michelle Forbes) are pronounced dead when they try to transport back to the ship but don't re-materialize (though they actually do).When Geordi and Ro re-materialize on the Enterprise and realize no one can see/hear them, and they can go even through walls, they assume they are dead. But soon, they get hints - including slight changes to the ""real"" environment ""alerting"" others to their presence (as a ""ghost"" might do). And not only this, they soon realize that there's a ""dead"" Romulan among them too!But are they really dead? If not, what happened to them and can they change back in time? Watch this exciting episode to see!The visual effects in this episode are exemplary, especially during the chase ""through"" the Enterprise!Trivia note: the Bajoran Death Chant is over 2 hours long. And we see Riker playing his trombone again.Also, this episode stars Susanna Thompson as Inmate Jaya (she will later have a claim to fame as one of the Borg Queens in Star Trek: Voyager).",
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Next Phase (TV Episode 1992)",Are Ro and Geordi really dead?,"After responding to a distress call an away team beams over to a Romulan ship and set about helping them fix their engines. One part can't be fixed so Geordi and Ro are ordered to take it back to the enterprise for replication. Something goes wrong with the teleportation process and they fail to materialise; shortly afterwards they are declared dead. We then see that they are indeed aboard the Enterprise but nobody can see them and they can even walk through walls and people are they ghosts or is there a scientific reason? Ro believes the former even though she didn't previously believe in an afterlife but Geordi believes differently and thinks they should set about investigating. Not surprisingly the latter proves to be true and they learn that they have become cloaked due to an experimental Romulan device they also learn that the Romulans have sabotaged the Enterprise so that it will explode if it goes to warp so they will have to find out how to warm the others quickly. If that wasn't enough there is also a cloaked Romulan and he can see them. While this is going on the rest of the crew are making preparations for Ro and Geordi's funeral.This is one of my favourite episodes of TNG; we get good villains in the form of Romulans who are pretending to be friendly, a technological malfunction that has put two crew members in an unusual situation and some enjoyable conversations as people dwell on beliefs concerning death. It was nice to see Ro (a personal favourite) and Geordi take centre stage; both Michelle Forbes and LeVar Burton are on great form here. The story provides multiple threats which are nicely resolved I especially liked how the cloaked Romulan meets his end. Surprisingly it is never mentioned that Geordi and Ro face starvation if they don't find a way to decloak; the creators clearly hadn't forgotten the possibility though as the prologue features Geordi eating a lot and commenting that he hadn't eaten for two days. Overall a top quality episode.",9

The crew seem grateful but soon a serious problem becomes apparent when the transporter malfunctions--making several folks disappear. They are assumed to be dead but Ro and Geordi are actually 'out of phase'. In other words, they are alive and no one can see them. Well, the crew starts mourning for their lost comrades...during which time Ro and Geordi can walk through walls and see and hear everyone. Surprisingly, they learn that the Romulans have tampered with the Enterprise's engines--and it will blow up when they engage the warp drive! Can they possibly warn their crewmates and also return to normal?The best thing about this episode are the cool special effects. Seeing folks running through things is pretty nifty and the story is exciting and weird (in a good way). Well worth seeing.",8
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Next Phase (TV Episode 1992)",Too many logical failures,"I don't understand the high rating of this episode. Why do the floors support the phased/cloaked people? Why can Ro touch her control panel and not put her hand through it? Why did it take so long to figure out nobody could see her and why did she take on such a passive roll, at first? How did the Romulan become phased and cloaked? How could he have been sitting in his seat without passing through it? Of course, the problem was solved by magic gobbledygook technology. The obligatory ""5 seconds to total destruction"" scenes ensue.There are so many breakdowns in logic in the episode, so it is impossible to take the theological discussions seriously",4
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Next Phase (TV Episode 1992)","Interesting, but ultimately disappointing","Other people have pointed out the convenient factor that the floor can support them, but they can go through walls and equipment. That crossed my mind, but I guess I can deal with it. What seemed odd to me was the fact that they would not deal with the treachery by the Romulans that would've caused their deaths and they also did not discuss the technology that the Romulans were working on that would make people invisible and able to pass through objects. Both of these issues seem pretty damned important, but they just totally drop them at the end with no resolution whatsoever.",5
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Next Phase (TV Episode 1992)",Please Keep the Theological Stuff Out of This. They Weren't Dead!,"This is a very good episode. It has those nasty Romulans who can't back off, even when kindness is given to them. Their ship has been severely damaged and the Enterprise comes to the rescue. They rebuild their engine and get their ship up and going. In the process, Ro and LaForge are beamed back to the ship with an engine part, but in the process they are shoved into some sort of netherworld, able to move around the ship but unseen by the crew. After a period of time with no trace of them, the crew jumps to the conclusion that they are dead. This is really fast, considering the thoroughness that they usually take. By the way, they are not dead! This is not a religious experience! It's a transporter malfunction, brought on by the Romulans who are experimenting with another of their evil devices. After the Enterprise has done everything to show good faith, the scientists on board have planted something in the Enterprise that will destroy it when it goes to warp drive. Data is the key because of his tireless analysis of the ship. Geordi and Ro are really cute as sort of combatants and friends as they try to figure a way to be seen on board the ship. The crew deals with the ""deaths"" of the two which is touching and shows another side of them. Ro and Riker don't really get along and there is a overt tension throughout. It's a really good episode.",9

0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Inner Light (TV Episode 1992)",Everyone's favorite TNG,"Ask any Star Trek TNG fan to list their five favorite episodes and The Inner Light will make almost every list. Rightfully so. This is one of the best episodes in Star Trek lore. Maybe the best  and built on a good story. Other reviews have described the plot of Picard living another lifetime in 20 minutes while mentally tethered to an alien probe. It is poignant, touching, beautiful, painful. What strikes me is the unseen epilogue.Think about it. How can a person resume one life after experiencing another? From Picard's standpoint, he lived about 30  40 real years as someone else, only to be dropped back into his Starfleet life in an instant. Can he even remember how to be Captain after that long? Can he remember procedures and technical details and even the names of people he hasn't seen in decades? How painful his grief must be to have lost his wife years before, then his children. He outlived them all, and nobody else he encounters has any memory of them. In fact, it never really happened at all. Where is a support group for this? Recovering from a Borg assimilation seems almost pedestrian by comparison. He has lost a family, a world and a life. He is further tasked with honoring the wishes of a dead civilization that longed to be remembered. One wonders how a man as private as Picard will be able to tell of these people and share his pain and deal with his grief.In all likelihood, he would handle this mostly in private. Maybe he would pull out the old flute  the only tangible reminder of his other life  and play it in the quiet of his own quarters. Great idea. The simple little melody is incredibly poignant as it speaks in just a few notes of the loss he must feel. It seems most viewers feel that loss as well. This viewer certainly did  the almost tangible sadness has made the tears well up some at the end. Kudos for a great episode.",10
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Inner Light (TV Episode 1992)",The Wife,"I have heard many comments, all true I might add, about how great the cast in this one was.However,I think the wife really sold it and the entire show makes it because she plays it so well. In a few of the scenes she is simply radiant.I think this wonderful actress may have surpassed her own abilities with this script. I think most actors that are fortunate to find work find that one role where it all just comes together.This episode should have cleaned up at any awards show. Too bad no one was looking. How is it possible that anyone watched this and didn't think it worthy of an award?Someday maybe Hollywood will get it. While the technical stuff is all fine and good, only a good story can be made into a great movie or episode. And this story was really good.",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Inner Light (TV Episode 1992)",To heck with Romeo & Juliet...this teaches true love...,"I cannot watch this episode without a box of tissues. I can cry on cue now without even thinking about it.There are layers upon layers of depth to this tale. We learn about love and sacrifice and the desire to keep the memory of people alive.I get sucked in at how Eline loves Picard absolutely despite his failings, and how he learns to love her unconditionally and give himself into the moment. When she's dying and says to him ""Put away your shoes."" I absolutely lose it. She handles her dying with dignity wanting to be alone with her husband letting him know exactly what he means to her. He learns that having children can be life altering. And yet, that's how we continue on is through our children. He loves how he teaches his daughter to love science and his son to love art.The acting in this was superb. The actors really gave themselves over into the characters that were richly developed in the script. I also like how they left you feeling a bit raw at the end with the haunting melody playing as the ship flew on. I could feel Picard's pain as he watched her die, as he looked at his grandson knowing the planet was dying.My husband and I once sat there and tried to figure out which of the ST:TNG episodes were really sci fi and which were ""Romeo and Juliet in outer space"" (Thank you Philip K. Dick for that quote). I don't feel this one was truly sci fi. Nor is it a morality play. It's an intense story of how we as people live our lives and hope that we make a difference somehow. And it's one of our favorites. Thank you, Morgan Gendel, for an amazing story, and thank you to all of the actors for trusting the tale and making it come alive.",
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Inner Light (TV Episode 1992)",Just an echo of everyone else's comments !,"The best episode of TNG ever.

Getting a lump in my throat just thinking about it ! I agree with the overall opinions of others the episode and Patrick Stewart should have received an Emmy. I have seen some of his Shakespearian roles and the character he portrays here is as close to, if not as good as some of the roles he has played on stage. As a matter of fact, there are times throughout the scenes on the planet, it seems as though they are acting out the roles on a stage, rather than on a TV set. The entire cast of the people on the planet deserve credit for their efforts and acting abilities.",10
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Inner Light (TV Episode 1992)",I can't watch this episode without crying.,"This beautiful, profound episode gets me every time I watch it. It hits me on so many levels. Having had 2 wives die unexpectedly, the first from cancer and the second during childbirth, and living with the memory of the love that we shared, this episode stirs up emotion in me that I just cannot contain. From another ST:TNG episode there is a line that says something about death being that point in which one exists only in the memories of others. But it is not an end. The reappearance of Eline and Batai near the conclusion and the final scene with Picard and the flute reaffirm this in a marvelous and inspiring way, and resonates with me in ways that make me feel both sad and joyous at the same time.The way the Resikans preserve their memories and lives through Picard is one of the most touching, deep, and profound stories that has ever been told in any genre and through any media. And the fact that it has this impact on me (and obviously others considering the comments posted here) makes me feel alive and energized.For anyone who has not seen ""The Inner Light,"" you must do so. Buy it. Rent it. Catch it in reruns, but do not miss it. Let it wash over you and if it makes you weep, then let the tears flow. You will be a better person for it.",10
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Inner Light (TV Episode 1992)",One Of The Next Generation's Best,"I will admit that I am not a die-hard Star Trek fan. I am more of casual fan who watches the show occasionally and nabs the occasional DVD. In fact before watching this on the recently released ""Alternate Realities"" DVD box set, I really don't think I had seen this episode before. I say that with regret because out of the many episodes of The Next Generation I have seen, I would have no issue with calling this one of the best i have seen if not the best.For one thing there's the performance of Patrick Stewart. Stewart gets to step out of his role of Jean-Luc Picard to play Kamin, a simple man living in simple world. Stewart portrays first Picard then to Kamin and the truth is that if it wasn't for the occasional scenes on the Enterprise the transition would be complete because even though Stewart plays both roles they are completely different people. It's a fantastic performance to say the least and a true shame that Stewart wasn't even nominated for an Emmy for this performance. Around Stewart is a terrific supporting cast. There the villagers made up of Richard Riehle and Scott Jaeck in speaking roles who both do well. Then there's Kammin's family including Jennifer Nash as his daughter Meribor and Patrick Stewart's own son Daniel Stewart as Batai. The true standout though of the supporting cast is Margot Rose as Kamin's wife Eline. Like Stewart, it is a shame that Rose wasn't even nominated for an Emmy Award because she gives an excellent performance.Yet behind all the excellent performances there lies the script. Writers Morgan Gendel and Peter Allan Fields created a story that while set on another planet is more of a human drama then it is a science fiction story. True it has science fiction elements all in it (it wouldn't be Star Trek without them) but these two writers in this script reveal a basic truth about science fiction: a science fiction story is only as compelling as the human story within it. The Inner Light be lack space battles but it has more then enough heart to make up for it and is all the better for it.From the performance of Patrick Stewart to the supporting cast and the script, The Inner Light is a first rate episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. That is because, that while it may be lacking in the seemingly prerequisite space battles and aliens, it has a fascinating human drama playing out not beneath it all but at the forefront of it all. In fact, The Inner Light is all the better for it. If you want to see what makes a great science fiction story see this episode.",9
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Inner Light (TV Episode 1992)",comparing Inner light with City On The Edge Of Forever,"I feel certain that the writers of Inner Light intended a comparison with The City On The Edge Of Forever, and it's good to see it recognized by Star Trek affictionados, and reviewers here.The premise of how Picard enters this alternative life, is not particularly strong, any more than how Kirk and Spock enter their's in search of McCoy, but it doesn't matter because what then follows is totally believable and totally absorbing. We are allowed to lose ourselves completely in the non-Federation story line and the Enterprise and its crew are sensibly left almost completely out of it. In Inner Light we see the Enterprise only as a reminder of where Picard should be, but for the rest of the time we enter his world and alternate life as fully as he does. Giving the painfully private Picard an entire family is genius. He was the only man in TNG that could have been chosen by the Probe. And it ends like waking from a blissful, though heart-renderingly sad dream. Brilliant acting, stupendous writing and totally absorbing, it puts Inner Light up there with Time Squared and Darmok as the best TNG episodes for me. and yeah, I cry when I watch it too.",
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Inner Light (TV Episode 1992)",A Masterful Episode,"This episode, in my mind, has always been the absolute best of the series. Stewart really got the opportunity to show what he can do. The writing is exceptional as well.The relationship Picard builds with Eline is very believable and you get the sense that he has really experienced many years as a husband and father. The characters, especially his family, all have a great deal of depth and it's easy to build an emotional attachment to them all.This episode shows what can be done with really good Sci Fi. It's not about the technology. It's about the story.",10
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Inner Light (TV Episode 1992)","A Touching, Moving Story","This is, hands down, my favourite TNG episode, and I have seen all of them, some numerous times. I had the opportunity to see this again today, and felt compelled to comment on it. Perhaps it is because I am aging (60-something), and now a grandfather, and seeing my life so rapidly slipping by me. My theory of the perception of the passage of time is that your perception of the length of of any finite period of time is in inverse proportion to the amount of life experience you have. If you are 10, one year is 10% of your life -- a long time. When you are 50, one year is 2% of your life. It seems to pass 5 times as quickly as when you were 10. So, my life is passing quickly, as Picard's did in this story. Maybe that's why I relate to it so readily.Then there is the acting. Eline is beautifully and skilfully portrayed. I almost fell for her myself. She is sweet, loving, kind and gentle. Yet she challenges Kamin when she should, and he listens to her. When she returns at the end, my throat tightens up with emotion. She also is beautiful without being flashy (I hope you know what I mean).Batai is a great friend. Perhaps because I have found very few really good friends in my life, I find the relationship of Kamin with Batai as appealing. It is touching when Kamin and Eline name their second child after Batai. It is even more touching when he also returns at the end.Kamin's daughter Meribor is a delight. I have two daughters, and see parts of both of them in her. She seems so natural for the part. When she says ""I love you father""... it gets me every time.The only slightly disappointing point is that the aging makeup for Kamin got less believable as the show progressed. At the end it was difficult to continue to suspend belief.Patrick Stewart deserved acclaim for this portrayal. The scene at the end, when he exclaims ""Oh, it's me -- it's me that it finds"" when he realizes that the probe is destined to contact him -- is so believable. And his reaction to the crew when he returns to the Enterprise seems just right. Finally, as he clutches his flute to his chest, I can almost feel his character's angst at having loved and lost, and the depth of the plethora of emotions that would necessarily encompass someone who had experienced something like this.I am saving this one on tape. It is so poignant and touching that I simply must see it again from time to time, to touch some of those thoughts that are too often submerged in my own life.",10
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Inner Light (TV Episode 1992)",Damn Good Episode,"Toddhavista (review above me) must be smoking CRACK !!!! That was possibly the best episode of Star Trek TNG ever! It's primarily focus is Patrick (Jean-Luc Piccard) and how he lives an entire lifetime (within 1/2 hour) on a planet that's been extinct 1000 years, due to a supernova. Rather than focus on some new technology, it brings home the point that life is for living, in the now, not later! It's, if nothing else, an episode in the style of the original Star Trek, where social commentary was veiled with SCI-FI Metaphor. I remember it vividly and was pleased to see it again, recently on the SciFi channel! The music, especially the flute melody is haunting. Definitely NOT a holodeck episode (like toddhavista says).",10

It must be something that I hold dear that it links with; maybe the idea that as humans we have such a short time on this earth and the best we can hope for is to be remembered, and remembered fondly.
We should all hope for such a beautiful journey through life, to cherish the ones we love and to be cherished, and to be gifted that experience, especially for a character such as Picard who's devotions are so often selfless, to have that experience of having a life with such shared experiences gifting him the guilty pleasures of familial love at an intimate level, is a beautiful thing.",10

12,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Inner Light (TV Episode 1992)",The Best Trek Ever,"It's been almost twenty years now since I first saw ""The Inner Light,"" and I still think it's the best episode of any Star Trek series. The writing, acting and direction are nothing short of brilliant. I was sitting there on 8 Sep 1966 for the premiere of what we now call Trek Classic, and I have never seen them do better than ""The Inner Light."" Hence, it gets a perfect 10 from me. Whoever called it TNG's ""City on the Edge of Forever"" was not mistaken, although I think the edge for ""best ever episode"" goes to ""The Inner Light.""It seems odd, really, that the best episodes of Classic and TNG are more or less Star Trek in name only. The Trekkish trappings are all there at the top and bottom of both episodes, but in the middle we get a wonderful story about these characters, who in each case are far removed from their normal time, place and circumstance.What an achievement this episode was. Writing about this has made me miss the series all over again.",10
13,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Inner Light (TV Episode 1992)","Best writing, best acting come together","My greatest joy in watching this series, after discovering the actors for the first time in Season 1, was in watching the writers challenge the actors to show their talents. 42-minute episodes in continuing series are difficult circumstances for an individual actor to shine, especially when the series depends so heavily on the strength of the ensemble.""The Inner Light"" is right up there with ""City on the Edge of Forever"" from TOS for that rare blend of writing and acting that is necessary to be recognized by peers and given an award. Every character in the story, every development as well, was true to the series core (and not just to the Star Trek universe). The culture of the Kataanians was nuanced, evoking its differences efficiently (something that's very hard to do in the limited time given). I was particularly taken by the use of language, with such phrases as ""go carefully"" and ""happy day"", familiar for meaning and context, very different by comparison to what the viewer is used to hearing.I can imagine the shuddering going on around the ""holodeck episode"" syndrome, and in large part I can sympathize with it. I would urge the viewer to give ""The Inner Light"" a break, though, because this story stands alone in every respect, and makes best use of the plot device.I'm 50 years old. I've seen four TV shows that brought tears to my eyes. This one stands at the top of that list, because the first time I saw it I cried as well. No higher accolade can I offer.Her part was small, though very important to the story, but I'd like to give special mention to Jennifer Nash as Meribor. She was an equal partner with Patrick Stewart in every scene they shared, which was every scene she appeared in. I could well imagine Meribor in command of a starship one day, if it wasn't clear that she was already dead and gone for a thousand years. Truly her father's daughter in the story.I had to stop short of giving this a 10 out of 10. The aging effect, particularly for Picard, was distracting towards the end and not very believable. I would have hoped they'd spend a little more of their budget and get his transformation right (something TOS seemed able to do successfully with a lot less money). The face became rigid for both Picard and Eline. The actors might as well have been doing voice over at couple of spots, for all they could emote through the prosthetics.",9

It sucked me in and spit me out into another dimension of reality. I have seen life differently every since. This episode reflects the eastern philosophy that this life experience is really a dream and not reality at all. To live a lifetime in 25 minutes rings a strangely familiar chord. Think about it. Dreams seem like they transpire over a much longer period time than they really do, maybe just a few minutes. You awake to find yourself somewhat displaced. My bet is that when you end this life experience, the Inner Light will be your reality. I challenge you to see this life as a Lucid Dream, and actively participate in its outcome.

I had my guard up before this episode. This episode was simply amazing and could be worthy of the ""One of television finest hours"" mantra. The music at the end stays with you.

It is by far the best episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" but I also think it's the best show of any of the hundreds of episodes of any of the Star Trek shows...it's THAT good.The show begins with a probe nearing the Enterprise. Suddenly, a beam shoots onto the bridge and hits Picard. In the next scene, Picard awakens on a planet--one he's never seen and never heard of. When he tries to talk about his life on the Enterprise, no one seems to believe or understand--to them, he is just a member of their community and always has been. And, through the course of the show, Picard's new persona lives, loves and grows old in this new world. What happens next I won't say...you just have to see this one.It's hard to put into words what's so great about this one.

Congratulations on being my first.This is the best Star Trek episode ever. An actor is a master when he can make you forget he's acting. That happened for me with so many of the characters in this episode.The idea is a trick of the mind. What is important is that these long dead people will go on in one of the greatest human minds set into fiction. The character, a beloved one for many years, is inexorably affected by this experience, which he felt as real - not as a holodeck simulation which he could dismiss as fictional.

It is touching on so many levels of feelings that I cannot even begin to analyze which part I love the most and I am sure everyone who has watched this piece of art will agree:For me, the mere tought of space is always bound to give me goosebumps and feelings of sadness... Because I always think about how many worlds and civilizations may have been out there that have vanished maybe tenthousand years ago; wiped away by a meteor impact or a supernova.And this episode just takes all these feelings and transforms them into a solid, almost theatrical performance of great actors. Captain Jean-Luc Picard is forced into the life that is not his own and even his character developement inside this episode - from trying to escape from the ""dream"" to accepting it and living his life there to the fullest - would be enough for a thrilling experience. But this episode goes much deeper: As we see Picard falling in love with ""his"" wife, having children, growing old and becoming a person so much different then what we would ever think of him, a feeling of sadness and melancholy emerges as we begin to comprehend that the planet he is living on is dying and the civilization about to become extinct.Seeing his children rise from infants to adults, falling in love, starting careers and having children of their on with Picard becoming an old man is a great example of showing the ""circle of life"" inside a movie and combined with the approaching end of his civilization, this episode delivers a 45min long ode to life and its beauty.This is by far my most favorite episode of Star Trek, maybe even of all TV-shows and to be honest I think this would have made a great movie... 10/10 any time of the day.",10

The mystery depends when the waves are traced to Devidia II. There, they encounter what seems like human life forms that are a fraction of a second out of phase.Then, Data is transported via the Devidian's time distortion portal to 1890s San Francisco, where he (as a Frenchmen, and getting money through poker) meets Mark Twain, and more incredibly, Guinan (played by Whoopi Goldberg)!Trivia note: Data speaks French! And Worf says a rare ""Beam me up"".",

I've heard recordings of Mark Twain impersonators who knew him in his lifetime, and I've seen the rare footage Edison did of him, this marries the two. So we can literally SEE Mark Twain speak and walk and it is just done SO well, even compared to Hal Holbrook's great work.In fact, I believe this episode happened. These two episode are so well written, and the concept is so odd, that I have to ask, which alternate universe did it come from? It's not the usual Time Travel gimmickry. As usual my formula for great Time episodes are when it's accidental, and I would say Data stumbling from Dividia II in the 24th Century to Market Street in 1893 San Fransisco is one great bumble.And he does not lose a beat, he immediately picks up a newspaper and starts getting his bearings - AND a Poker Game with Gul Dukat (Marc Alaimo) and Mr Mott in human form, who says ""Go to Blazes"" to Joe Fallinghawk, the other card shark.But what is of great importance here is Guinan's role in this, we finally get some great background of the character, and to see her with Mark Twain and Data just tickles me.These Dividia II Aliens were so strange, so bizarre, and what they were doing so Insidious that my skin crawled. And that ""Ophidian""... Shudder.Data has to inspect his own 500-year old head, which is another creepy thing.

3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Time's Arrow (TV Episode 1992)",I guess I will see you again in about 500 years. And I will see you in a few minutes.,"This episode was the fifth season ending ""cliffhanger"" episode and was a better one for the series finale, in my opinion. It deals with the discovery of Lt. Commander Data's severed head inside an underground cavern area in San Francisco during an excavation in 24th Century Earth. This discovery introduces the aspect of death to the android and that he doesn't have an infinite life span after all. The underground cavern emits very rare wave transmissions that could only originate from outside of Earth, so the crew becomes involved in a mystery in trying to connect the discovery of Data's head to the wave's source. They discover that aliens are using a device that allows them to go back to Earth's past and that allows them to hunt for their required energy source (which happens to be human neural energy). The Enterprise crew enters the time distortion portal in order to stop the aliens from continuing to extract the neural energy from the San Francisco populace of the 1880s. The theme of time travel has been covered in many science fiction movies and often times, there are gaping logic flaws or illogical plot twists. In this episode, there is a good plot flow and no gaping logic flaws. The only thing that does appear to be a bit flawed is when Data first appears in the 1880s San Francisco streets after entering the time distortion field. As he walks around, none of the people out in the streets take notice of him even though he looks totally different then they do (apparel and skin texture). Other than this part of the episode, this was definitely one of the better one in the series and with the ""Inner Light"" episode that immediately preceded it, this series reached its peak at the end of Season 5.",9
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Time's Arrow (TV Episode 1992)",The mystery of Data's head,"The Enterprise is called back to Earth following a shocking discovery in a cavern under San Francisco. The artefact, which has been there since the 1890's is Data's head! Data is unperturbed by this; in fact quite the opposite; he sees the fact that he will die one day as a comfort as it means he is more 'human'. Some evidence in the cavern suggests that there is a link to the planet Devidia II; they head there and find that there is a temporal distortion there. Picard wants to keep Data safe on the ship but evidence suggesting the presence of phase-shifted aliens necessitates his visit to the site. He moves out of phase and follows 'two aliens carrying a snake' then vanishes when he reappears he is in 1890s San Francisco. Here he sets about building a device to detect the aliens but is distracted when he sees a newspaper featuring a familiar face: Guinan. Meanwhile back on the Enterprise the crew work to build a phase shifting device so they can investigate what happened to Data and Guinan informs Picard that this is one away mission he must take part in; if he doesn't they may never meet.This, the first episode of a two part story, gets off to a great start with the discovery of Data's head. This immediately sets up a mystery; how did it end up in the cavern and just as importantly how much time does Data have before he meets his unavoidable fate? Unsurprisingly the answer to the latter question is not that long as that is what this story is about. When we learn what the aliens Data followed are doing it is clear that they are suitably creepy yet not too much is given away. As well as the drama we have some great characters; Whoopi Goldberg is great as Guinan; I must say I prefer the restrained performance she gives here to her more comic performances although there is a hint of that when she meets Data in the 1890s. We also learn more about her character; most notably that she is very old. Guest characters are also fun; most notably Jerry Hardin portrayal of Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain) and Michael Aron's Jack London. As this is the first part of two there is little in the way of resolution but the finale sets things up nicely for part two.",8

Eventually, the crew gets down to the business of why that head was there and the time travel aspect is where things begin to stall. Data in the 1890s, especially. Guinan's presence there seems a bit forced, although Mark Twain's scenery chewing is an amusement. Tightened up, this could've been a good episode; but a cliffhanger?6/10",6
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Time's Arrow (TV Episode 1992)",Season Five,"The second half of Season Four of Star Trek: The Next Generation really amped up the political aspect of its episodes (conflicts, wars, hard-hitting material, etc.), eschewing the light-hearted or more one-off fare that mostly populated subsequent seasons. That political bent carries over into the first third or so of this season, but is gradually phased out again in a return to more imaginative material. Personally, I think this show thrives on the high-concept plots and character development rather than the ""political stuff"", so I welcomed the shift back. Suffice it to say, however, that there is a little bit for everyone in this season.Some thoughts on Season Five...-The ""big episodes"" of this season never did much for me. ""Redemption"", where Worf gets the limelight, kicks off the season on an odd note. Not longer after, ""Unification"" teases the return of Leonard Nimoy as Ambassador Spock, yet the concept just fizzles out over the span of two episodes. The season finale, ""Time's Arrow"", is also pretty weak. You can't build an entire arc premise around ""Data's head found under San Francisco"". So, I really felt that every time the show tried to ""go big"" this season, it didn't deliver (at least for me).
-Fortunately, there are enough episodes ""in between"" that are engaging and develop the characters without some political bent making things so serious. ""Conundrum"" is a classic mystery, ""Disaster"" offers some of the best bits of any TNG episode (Worf delivering a baby, Picard interacting with children), and Ethics sees Worf go through a crisis of the highest order with his son now by his side. These are the types of episodes that TNG thrives upon...interesting plots and then letting the characters interact with each other.
-A new character (Ensign Ro) is introduced. While I liked the concept of a fresh face, Ro is almost made too patently unlikeable to ever really work (at least so far). She isn't a terrible addition, by any means, but the idea works better than the execution to this point.
-The last spate of episodes this season are pure gold. ""Cause & Effect"" is high-concept at its best (Enterprise caught in a time loop), ""I Borg"" brings back everyone's favorite baddies, ""The Next Phase"" examines a fascinating concept, and then there's ""The Inner Light""....easily the best performance from Stewart's Picard on the show to this point. If able, I would bump the star rating of this Fifth Season up to 4.5 based on the quality of the close-out episodes alone.Overall, then, I thought that Season Five of TNG started off a bit stodgy/stale (much like Season Four ended), but then made a conscious effort to get back to (IMHO) what the show does best. Thus, as the season progresses, we are given episodes were different characters interact with each other and plots worthy of such an imaginative show.Beginning to end, this is probably the best season of the show so far in its run. The ""bad"" episodes aren't terrible (more like overcooked or stodgy), while the good episodes are all-time classics. Nothing to shy away from here...the third consecutive solid season in a row for TNG.",9

As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 05Not the ethical throughout provoking dilemmas, nor the smart innovative concepts, this season is well aware of its audience from now, and the writers willfully fiddles with the characters like puppets and just lets their history and connection with their fans works the charm.Time's Arrow Part IOnce again, this two part act that is weaved out in order to keep the audience hooked at the end of the season and wolfish for more, is actually better at endorsing itself than proving its ideologies, these missions are clearly not going as anticipated.",

With Picard infested with a Borg assimilation, the Enterprise must fight the Borg in general and the Borg with Picard's personality and strategic knowledge. Riker must make decisions that are original and unpredictable to counter the intelligence and adaptability of the Borg. It stretches the entire crew because the mind of Picard is such a private thing; he is a complex being with amazing adaptability as his career with the flagship Enterprise is obvious to the world. The Borg are approaching Earth and the future of the seminal planet of the Federation is at stake. Many of the Federation ships were destroyed in the huge battle where Picard was captured (the Enterprise survived by coming late to the dance). The conclusion to this episode is excellent. It creates a set of possibilities for future conflicts with the Borg as they bully their way. We also have the unanswered questions about what will become of Picard. Set aside time to watch the two episodes together. Excellent television.",10
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Best of Both Worlds: Part II (TV Episode 1990)",Star Trek: The Next Generation - Best of Both Worlds Part II,"I remember waiting with such anticipation for the second part of Star Trek: The Next Generation's ""Best of Both Worlds"". I recall those goosebumps left when *Captain* Riker (Jonathan Frakes) uttered those three immortal words, ""Mr. WorfFire."" Seeing Picard ""part of the Borg collective"", ""assimilated"" with his humanity raped of him, was such a bone-chilling visual. Equally bone-chilling is what the Borg do to the Federation ships which engaged them at Wolf 359the Enterprise, after getting repairs done when an attempt to destroy the Borg cube failed, finally arrive to witness all the wreckage left behind. There was some interesting content in this episode with absent Picard (Patrick Stewart) like Captain Riker deciding with some serious thought not to promote Data (Brent Spiner) in favor of Borg expert (and Lieutenant) Shelby (Elizabeth Dennehy) as his ""#1"" and a really nice scene which has Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) giving Riker a pep talk regarding ""letting go of Picard"" and embracing the role he has now.In my revisit to the series as an older adult in my late 30s, I have more of an appreciation for the little ""chat"" scenes featuring the likes of Whoopi and others. You get plenty of officer / on-the-job jargon (techno-babble) that gives the show its intellectual merit, but ultimately it is about seeing someone you love and respect abducted, forced against his will into a relationship with an enemy, and knowing that the adversary has taken his brilliance and knowledge in order to harm the very ones he has served to protect.As Shelby says at the end, through Riker's own genius (using the separated saucer to fire anti-matter beams as a distracting measure so he could have Data and Worf fly in a shuttlecraft to abduct Locutus (the Borg name for Picard)) he was able to outwit an enemy with superior technology and weaponry despite their having Picard's strategic intelligence in the fold, and could have his fair choice of many a command. That has always been a bone of contention with Riker having to constantly defend his decision to serve under Picard: many of us might can relate if we could get a promotion yet enjoy working for someone superior to us due to what was still left for us to learn.Data ""hooked"" to Locutus in the hopes that they can gain information needed to find vulnerabilities in the Borg, processing it all, with Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) monitoring his life signs, and Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) using her telepath ability to sense when Picard might be returning from the fog of the assimilation certainly add suspense already whipped up by what Riker and Shelby are trying to strategically accomplish as the Borg cube uses a beam to cut into the Enterprise hull along with trying to tractor beam to grab hold to the ship. Returning Picard mentioning ""sleep"" to Data and how this will be used to counteract the Borg's decision to assimilate him into their collective as Locutus is the ultimate irony. But how does Picard ever truly heal from what the Borg did to him, with this rape leaving behind the whole awful experience, including the destruction of officers at Wolf 359 led by a man he knew since he was a freshman at Starfleet? Superior storytelling and the chance to see Riker in the role of Captain, not only rescuing Picard but being in charge of the Enterprise that led to the defeat of the Borg before they could threaten Earth. The show was still just getting started! Seeing Picard with a look of severe discomfort, certainly feeling the chill of what the Borg's work on him caused towards those he couldn't save will be addresses in the powerful episode, ""Family.""",9
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Best of Both Worlds: Part II (TV Episode 1990)",Massacre at Wolf 39,"I can't watch the second half of ""The Best of Both worlds"" without thinking of the long-term effects of Captain Picard's enslavement by the Bog (i.e. ""First Contact"") and that final scene bears far more emotional weight . His scars from those implants run terribly deep, and the Locutus scenes are actually more heartbreaking than they are shocking.As a whole, given that this is the payoff of a months-long cliffhanger ending, I think the writers did a tremendous job. Starfleet's under attack, Picard's life hangs in the balance, and the stakes are sky-high. Despite the big action and the images of adrift starships, this is a surprisingly low-key way to finish the story. But far from boring.8/10",8

Of course Dr. Crusher and Data can ""deborg"" him and that almost serves as an anti-climax.

Picard, reeling from the effects of being invaded by the Borg, goes on holiday to visit his brother at his vineyard. There is little love between the brothers. Robert (Row-Bear) has stayed close to the soil, growing grapes and producing wine, while Jean-Luc has been exploring the stars. Robert, the older brother, has been in the shadow of his brother his whole life and is full of resentment. Even though they have not seen each other for years, the tension between them can be cut with a knife. His brother comes off initially as petty and small minded. He also accuses Jean-Luc of trying to corrupt their son. The thing that is going on, however, is that the Captain is damaged. He has never felt out of control before and his experiences in the previous episode are on his sleeve. There is a wonderful scene which I won't spoil.Other subplots have to do with Worf's adoptive parents showing up on the Enterprise. It's the old Klingon tussle with his roots. His parents are impressive, especially his father, a very well known engineer. They are, however, humans, and Worf feels they are a bit too showy. It's a neat subplot.Also, Beverly Crusher hands Wesley a recording his father made for him. She has picked up a storage box that contained his effects, including his uniform. He, of course, died early. There are some scenes in this episode that will make it hard to keep a dry eye. What a great beginning to this season.",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Family (TV Episode 1990)",Meet the Picards!,"After watching The Best Of Both Worlds I really believed Next Gen could not get better than this. Then I saw this episode and had to pinch myself as it was one of the best episodes of Star Trek as a whole, that I've ever seen. This is actually part three of the previous two parter and is about Jean Luc's exorcism from the demons of his experience as part of the Borg collective. The guest cast in this was first rate and Jeremy Kemp was fantastic as the brother with a grudge to Jean Luc. Worf's foster parents gave a golden performance and really brought a warmth and new softer side not often seen in Worf. In the Picard home we see Robert and Jean Luc squabbling and it eventually comes to blows then laughter at their absurdity of being two men fighting like schoolchildren! Jean Luc's laughter quickly turn to tears as the events of his experience overcome him. Robert makes it clear that Jean Luc needed that release and the two get to singing and drinking together. Worf eventually confronts his parents and tells them that he does care and he's glad to have them aboard. They make it clear the he is their son and that they love him and would be proud of him no matter what he'd done, in one of the episode's most touching scenes. Back at the Picard's Jean Luc says farewell and he says goodbye in turn to Rene then Marie, Robert hands Jean Luc a bottle of Château Picard and tells Jean Luc to try and not drink it alone. The two brothers then face each other for a brief moment, watch these two actors for a powerful scene as they look at each other as two brothers who have nearly lost a lifetime together and finding it again, who then embrace, and Jean Luc walks away. Back on the Enterprise Worf's parents are departing and Worf asks his Mom to send him some rokeg blood pie! When Jean Luc meets Worf and family he is delighted and asks Sergei did he have the full tour of the ship, he replies that there's still a few areas because of the repairs, he is quickly bustled into the transporter room by his wife to depart, Jean Luc walks away with a smile being far more repaired than the ship itself.",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Family (TV Episode 1990)",All in the family,"'Family' is one of my favorite TNG episodes; partly because it's deceptively uneventful, but mostly because it's a brilliant human drama. The acting is impressive from everyone involved, but especially Patrick Stewart. This shore leave story feels entirely necessary after the dust settles from 'The Best of Both Worlds' and Picard takes this opportunity to reconnect with his roots. A contentious sibling relationship is something we can all relate to, but Robert is the presence Picard needs to finally come to terms with what he was forced to do: ""You don't know, Robert. You don't know... They took everything I was. They used me to kill and to destroy and I couldn't stop them!""This is a show-stopping scene and renews the explorer in Picard. And that restless sense of adventure doesn't stop with his generation.It's an amazingly cathartic episode.10/10",10
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Family (TV Episode 1990)",Definitely One Of The Strongest Episodes,"This story was PERFECTLY timed for a release after the Borg crisis. It reminded us of humans' and klingons' superiority over the Borg in the form of three dimensional, sentient beings who aren't under the thrall of collectivized thinking. It also connected us even further into Worf and Picard's backgrounds. Patrick Stewart delivered a convincing and passionate note of closure (until ""First Contact"") about his traumatic Borg experience, which his character needed desperately and is probably why he visited his family in the first place.Every every actor who was involved with this episode delivered well, including the guest actors who played Worf and Picard's relatives.It's definitely a great start to season four.",9
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Family (TV Episode 1990)",Star Trek: The Next Generation - Family,"""Family"" is a very personal film to me. While the subplot with Wesley Crusher is of such significance to me, the ""Picard returning home to France to salvage old wounds still bleeding just a bit"" part is certainly a major reason the episode retains such a measure of value, with this power that resonates because of what just previously happened to the Captain in ""The Best of Both Worlds"".In ""Family"" Picard's past will be open to us, as will his emotional wounds still gushing internally yet truly shared externally. Picard's brother, a wine grower, taking his father's place on the farm kept in the family for generations, still harbors ill will, resentment, and jealousy towards Jean Luc; mainly displeased with how he left behind such a shadow, brother Robert (Jeremy Kemp) considers him too arrogant, absent humility, and ""too good"" for the farm and little village of his youth. This is Picard's chance to right the ship and better his relationship with a brother he hasn't seen in 20 years (he hadn't visited the home of his youth in this span of time), but ""Family"" is also a chance to explore the Borg's rape of the Captain. Such violation gave Patrick Stewart an opportunity to expose emotions laid bare, with a vulnerability rarely shown at such a scale; Picard spends a lot of time distanced and withdrawn, until he finally admits it all in a confessional to a brother needing to see his ""humanity"". That muddy scuffle in the wine thickets is a chance to see just how damaged a person can be when violated as Picard just breaks open for Robert who is honest in that the Captain will have no choice but to live with what Locutus of Borg did to innocent life. That tension between brothers, with a charming Samantha Eggar as Robert's wife, Marie, trying to smooth matters over and offering a kindness Picard so desperately needs, provides plenty of emotional fireworks. Robert and Marie's son has dreams of being a starship captain, bonding with Picard while he's visiting. There's a beautiful closing scene where the kid is looking out into the stars that perhaps paralleled Jean Luc's own experience as a child. Sadly, as we learn later, this dream won't come true.Also a marvelous subplot features Theodore Bikel and Georgia Brown as Worf's delightful human parents: unflappable, proud, and awestruck by their son's achievements and the Enterprise itself, taking advantage of the shore leave and the starship's docking at an orbit of Earth while under repairs after their war with the Borg, these two just want to see their son and spend time with him. Bikel, of course, is so amazed at the ship and wants to see every inch of it, fascinated by its inner workings because he was once an officer (now retired, of course, but still he's curious and interested), with Brown always so gushing with joy, sometimes embarrassing to Worf (he asks them to possibly ""be more restrained""). A smaller but just as valuable subplot has Dr. Crusher going through her husband's things from Earth kept in a box for the right time, finding an ""introduction"" to her son from him, wondering if she should allow Wesley to finally see it (she feels uncertain because he's just coming to terms with his father's absence). Because I lost my father at such a young age, this was especially potent to me. Wesley seeing his father, the message directed to him right after birth, and the father talking as if he would have plenty of time to direct other messages to his son: this allows a son to see his father and accept that while he never would have time with him, he would know what this man really felt and the look on his face while speaking this to his son. Ultimately, this is about Picard coming to grips with a contentious past regarding his brother that needed settling and to no longer avoid the agony beset upon him by the Borg experience.",10
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Family (TV Episode 1990)",You gotta see this one.,"This episode picks up after the giant Armageddon-like battle with the Borg. Now, things are calm and it's a time to regroup, relax and take stock. And, for Picard and Worf, it's a time to reconnect with family now that they are just outside the Earth. And, there's a minor plot involving Wesley viewing a message left to him by his father--a father who was killed in action long ago.As for Worf, he's embarrassed by his human adoptive parents. While nice folks, the always stolid and gruff Worf doesn't know how to act in front of the crew and he's obviously uncomfortable. And, in Picard's case, he heads back to his ancestral home in France--and his homecoming is awkward, as his relationship with his brother is estranged. It seems that the brother wanted Jean-Luc to remain home and run the family estate--whereas Jean-Luc wanted the adventure of space travel. All this gives Worf and Picard a chance to think through where they've come in life and where they are headed.This is a wonderful follow-up episode to the great two-parter that preceded it. Great because it explored the frailty of two important characters and did it in a way that seemed real and quite touching. Exceptionally well acted and among the very best shows in the series.",10

The reason he called Data here is because he has a last gift for him - an emotion chip (which will not be integrated into him until Star Trek: Generations).However, also beckoned by the signal Dr. Soong sent out is Lore (whom we last so in the 1st season episode ""Datalore""). And of course, this is where things go wrong.This episode marks Brent Spiner's strongest performance in the series (and perhaps the movies too) because he plays THREE characters - Data, Lore, Dr. Soong and manages to make each different and unique, thereby making US believe these 3 are interacting with each other. Brilliant to say the least.Trivia note: Data still can't whistle the song from the pilot episode ""Encounter At Farpoint"".",

The episode begins with a tragic episode where a child has played a practical joke on his brother and put his life in danger. He has to get to a star base to get medical attention. While the Enterprise makes its way to the star base, Data suddenly goes out of control. He jams up all the systems on the Enterprise including creating force fields throughout the ship. He sends that ship at Warp 9 to some unknown destination. The crew can't do a thing and don't even know where they are. The access codes were compromised which puts a damper on almost everything. At some point, the ship comes to a stop and Data beams down to the surface. In a house on an unnamed planet is Data's creator, Dr. Soong (played by Spiner) who is the cause of all this deception. He has decided that before he dies, he will implant a tiny emotion chip in his creation. Unfortunately, who should show up but Data's ""brother"" Lore. He preceded Data and was a bit of a failure, having actually precipitated the ""death"" of Soong (or so people thought) by betraying him to the Crystalline entity. The action at the house is wonderfully engaging. Once again, an episode to set up future conflicts, but also to explain the whole story of Data and Lore.",9

The crew is helpless to stop him as he isolates them from control of the ship and they can only wait to see where he takes them. Eventually, Data lands on a distant planet--and finds his maker, Dr. Soong. Apparently, Dr. Soong had activated a homing mechanism which forces him to return-- and with all due haste. However, there's a bit of a surprise with this homecoming, as soon Lor also arrives! There, the three talk about old times and Data learns the truth about his creation.All three major roles in the show are played by Brent Spiner--and they make up almost all the show. This is an interesting sort of experiment, though when I read the IMDb trivia, it indicated that they had considered Keye Luke for the role of Dr. Soong--and this would have been really interesting! Still, despite a teeny, tiny bit of overacting as Dr. Soong, Spiner did a nice job in this odd and demanding triple role. As for me, I am just happy that Lor returned, as he was a wonderful villain--and there's sure to be more of his evil shenanigans in upcoming episodes.",9

But something is REALLY odd about one of the teens--he's NOT a Talerian but a human. How he got to be with the Talerians is initially a mystery, but soon they learn through DNA tests that his family was wiped out by Talerians and the young boy was raised thinking he was a Talerian. The task is now to bring him back to his extended human family, but clearly he's too militant and too damaged to possibly be returned at this time. But, oddly, he will listen to no one but Captain Picard. So, the Captain is given a task he surely hates--to be the surrogate father to a very annoying and difficult young man. And, given that the Captain has almost no paternal instincts at all, this is indeed a HUGE problem! An even bigger problem develops when the Talariens arrive and demand to get the boy back...or else.This episode touches on many contemporary issues, such as child soldiers (a serious problem in some African conflicts), post-traumatic stress disorder and adoption difficulties. And, it touches on the BIG issue...that Picard hates dealing with children--though he really wasn't that bad with this initial effort.

With the two civilizations at peace, nothing would prevent him from keeping a foot in both worlds.

Soon, it's not only people that are disappearing around Dr. Crusher but the Enterprise itself! This episode also marks the return of Eric Menyuk as The Traveler (we last saw him 3 years ago in the first season episode ""Where No One Has Gone Before"") and the mention again of Dr. Selar.Trivia note: the Enterprise has 1014 people onboard including Dr. Quaice.

How is it possible to distinguish if it is you that's mad or all the people around you? Beverly has to face a situation difficult (and nearly impossible) to cope with. She's feeling totally sane but her behavior creates serious doubt in all the crew-mates around her... what makes her think they are crazy... in the end it turns out that not the inner but the outer space has been altered by a warp drive experiment carried out by Wesley. So she is completely sane as are the others but it is not her reality but some kind of alternate universe constantly shrinking as Wesley's ""Warp Bubble"" collapses...Gates McFadden's acting abilities are definitely put to the limit by this one and she isn't always able to deliver the necessary credibility of a woman close to breaking down and even on the edge of losing faith to herself due to changes in her outside reality. Although she's trying hard... and maybe that's the point. One can feel her trying and that's a step behind what would have been needed here...

4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Remember Me (TV Episode 1990)",An interesting story that loss appeal in production.,"This episode was actually a nice story but lost some interest in finally production. One of the crew, just so happen to be Doctor Crusher, thinks that she is losing her mind when people that she knows keeps vanishing from the ship. The rub is that Doctor Crusher is the only one that notices anything is wrong. The rest of the crew acts normally and believes that the Doctor is delirious. The situation with Doctor Crusher gets so bad that near the end, the entire Enterprise consist of the good doctor and Captain Picard. It seems to be that an experiment that Wesley was working-on could be behind the missing crew members.With an intelligent story line, this episode should have been an exciting trip though a confused mind but the script left us even more baffled than Doctor Crusher. When reviewing what made the show less interesting, it seems to fall right in the lap of Gates McFadden. For a person that is experiencing the disappearance of everything she knows, she put little emotion into her problem other than talking to herself. And it was strange when Doctor Crusher goes the entire episode and figures out the solution to her problem all by herself while the rest of the cast needs someone called a 'Traveler'.This was not a poor episode but such a nice story it should have been better. With a little more imagination in the script and a different ending, this could have been one of the better episodes in the collection.

For all of their hard work and risk, once she is brought back to reality she seems only appreciative that she is no longer alone.Interestingly, once Beverly is brought back to reality, her son Wesley lies physically depleted on the console unable to move from the exhaustive effort he expended on her behalf, but Beverly, in a subtle nod to hypergamy, moves first to the arms of the commanding Picard, leaving her depleted son to recover himself and walk himself over to her.It's a remarkable and prescient episode from the 1990s.",

8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Remember Me (TV Episode 1990)",Star Trek: The Next Generation - Remember Me,"I totally understand the general conceit that ""Remember Me"" is deeply flawed with a rather confusing reasoning behind why Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden, given a showcase episode) is trapped on an alternate Enterprise where officers she knows are vanishing with the remaining crew not remembering them. There's the script invention of a warp bubble caused by Wesley (Wil Wheaton) during an experiment in Engineering, which annoyed Geordi (LeVar Burton) to no end. How does Crusher get to Engineering and find herself trapped in that bubble? Well, she greets an old mentor named Dr. Dalen Quaice (Bill Erwin), and the two have a conversation about his losing his wife and friends to old age, ""unloading his emotional baggage"" to a friendly ear willing to listen. Losing your friends resonates to the point that Beverly goes to visit her son who is tinkering with a warp experiment, creating a bubble that conveniently ""nabs her"" and her alone. So at the moment she is nabbed, her thoughts create the alternate Enterprise and the emotional state whips up the gradual loss of all the officers and crew, particularly those she works alongside and loves. The sci-fi story cooked up for Dr. Crusher--all of that ""Bunny Lake is Missing"" / ""The Lady Vanishes"" madness where you know that person or people exist while others tell you they don't, along with the warp bubble device to set up the action for the central character -- is an excuse for McFadden to get her own episode with almost all the focus on her. When I first watched ""Remember Me"", it was a hit with me. Unlike some other Next Gen Trekkies, I love the Dr. Crusher character. Of course, I liked Pulaski, as well, so there you go. Still, McFadden's upset reactions to what is happening, all that frustration and bewilderment as Picard tells her he doesn't know Riker or Data and that only two people have ever been needed to operate the Enterprise (!), it is palpable with me. Easily the best moment, to me, is when Beverly urges Wesley to follow her to Picard to talk about the warp ""malfunction"", and when they get around a corner he's gone. I found that eerie. I also thought the emptied Enterprise with Beverly on her own was also quite effective. Picard arising on the Bridge with no one else on board, and then as she is about to admit her feelings for him (I always wished the writers would eventually capitalize on the potential for romance), just turning her face away momentarily, looking up to see that he's no longer therethat sinking feeling is sold by McFadden, with the feeling conveyed saying, ""What do I do now?"" I thoroughly enjoyed her ""talking it out"" on the Bridge, the battles with the computer (her confusing the computer with the ""gotcha"" question it couldn't answer was fantastic), reaching the inevitable answer as to why the ""vortex"" kept emerging in parts of the ship she encountered, and the ""aha"" moment where Engineering is realized as the area of the ship she needed to be. This episode was an example of the Next Gen giving to the secondary cast membersa show, particularly a great one as this was, had the longevity that afforded the opportunity for every cast member to get some episodes centered around them. The plot could be picked apart so easily and scrutinized to the hilt, for which I would agree that ""Remember Me"" will always be welcomed by some (mainly those that love McFadden and the Crusher character) and not by others (those who just don't like neither). Major failure: the inclusion of The Traveler (Eric Menyuk) with little to work with, seemingly part of the story to further emphasize Wesley's ""specialness"" and come to the rescue, but deserved of something far more substantial. The Traveler is the kind of character meant for a grandiose story, not showing up to get Wesley to summon the ability to bring together time and space to save his mom in the waning minutes of an episode which doesn't even explain where he goes after its over.",7

This would be disconcerting enough, but those who remain have no memory of the disappeared.

She is talent-free. She is an embarrassment. Her inability to act and perform was so pronounced that producers fired her from the show. Gates McFadden was fired because she was terrible.Is that clear enough or do you need to re-read the above paragraph a few dozen times?

In fact, there is an homage at the beginning of the episode with Picard saying in the captain's log that they ""bypassed Camus II"" to go to their emergency mission on Turkana IV. Camus II was featured in the last (79th) episode of the Original Series - ""Turnabout Intruder"".Also, this episode delves more into Tasha Yar's past, since Turkana IV is the planet she grew up on. We meet her sister, Ishara Yar, who isn't what she seems.Trivia note: you see the poker game again.

At the end of the episode she admitted she should've listened to the captain and beamed up at the beginning. Apparently she learned no lesson that stuck.I get in this era of longform storytelling the lack of continuity of TNG is even more frustrating than it was during its initial run.The best part of this episode is Beth Toussaint's compelling performance and it's a shame that they had to throw her away so quickly rather than make her a recurring character .",5

She is brought on board the Enterprise and joins them in rescue efforts to save the two men trapped below the planet. The leaders of the alliance give an ultimatum and the Enterprise must act. Ishara Yar masterfully gains the trust of the crew and is given great latitude in the rescue operation. During this time she is very critical of her sister. Data informs her of Tasha's great character and bravery. It seems the war on the planet excludes any sisterly affection and Ishara felt that Tasha took off rather than fight.

However, when the away team lands to retrieve them, some of the folks had apparently been taken prisoner by one of the planet's crazy factions. These factions are like giant gangs--gangs which have been fighting and destroying the planet for decades. Can the Enterprise trust one of these nasty brutes (who also claims to be Tasha Yar's sister) or is she just an awful jerk like the rest of them? Regardless, it will be tough on Data, as he's grown close to her.Whenever Tasha Yar and her rape planet are mentioned, I groan.

With the present Klingon leader near death, two factions are vying for leadership of the Empire. Gowran, and Duras. When Kimpec, the leader, reveals he was poisoned, Picard rightly suspects treachery and is asked to be Arbiter Of succession by Kimpec. Picard is aghast that such a request be put before him but quickly accepts when Kimpec points out how necessary it is that it must be an outsider. When Keylehr becomes suspicious of Worf's silence regarding his recent excommunication from the Empire she does some investigating and is murdered shortly thereafter by Duras. Worf takes the boy and tells him to look upon death and always remember. He then goes aboard Duras's ship and kills him. Picard later gives Worf a dressing down and places a reprimand on his record. Just after this Worf informs Keylehr's son he's sending him to live with Worf's human parents. Alexander then asks is Worf his father, Worf finally concedes and says yes.

Some internet critics claimed in those reviews that she was overacting, which is nonsense. If any actress can cause you to believe that a female Klingon-- even a half-human Klingon-- is sexy then it's an outstanding performance. She adds the right amount of fiery temper and sex appeal to the role.The story is never boring.

It's as if the writer picked up a book on how to write a dramatic story and then followed every guideline in that book: Put them in a bad situation (we're going to crash on a desert moon!), then make it worse (we have no water!); let them find what they need (a fountain of water!), but don't let them have it (it's protected by a forcefield!). It's the same with the garbage scow: Riker's captain is missing but he needs to save the planet; they need to destroy the barge but an asteroid belt is in the way; they need 30 minutes to tow it through the asteroid belt but radiation will reach lethal doses in 20 minutes. Such dramatic structures can work when well constructed, but in this episode they are built entirely on pretense.--There is no reason someone as poorly-trained as Wesley would go on the mission with the Captain; perhaps if the inhabitants were cherub-faced uber geeks, but they're not, they're miners.--There is no reason for the miners to pick up the Captain, since the Enterprise has its own shuttles.--Geordi does a safety inspection on the shuttle, then the thing immediately begins to fall apart! Geordi is not that incompetent.--As for the radioactive garbage scow, the only immediate threat is to get it out of the planet's orbit. Send it on any course away from the planet, go find the Captain, and then come back and destroy it.--If they absolutely needed to destroy the scow before finding the captain, no one on board the Enterprise seems to remember that they can fly in 3 dimensions! It's an asteroid BELT. Toss the barge out of the orbital plane on a curved trajectory to the sun! Sheesh! --The Enterprise clears the asteroid belt with 5 seconds left before LETHAL radiation exposure; at this point every viewer is rolling their eyes at the contrivances; maybe some characters' hair falling out, with that near-lethal exposure, would have made it less painful to watch.--And then of course Wesley saves the day, but this time they don't even bother to explain how. He just says, ""I think I figured it out"" and we see him pushing some buttons on his tricorder and then the forcefield clears from the fountain.The directing is just as bad.--At the beginning, when Wesley learns he's going to the Academy, he almost smacks shoulder to shoulder with Picard, and Picard has to step aside to let Wesley pass! Captains on their ships step aside for no one, and I doubt we're to believe that Wesley is suddenly dominant over Picard.--When the shuttle crashes, they leave an arrow to tell searchers where they went, and then they proceed to walk away in a direction that doesn't follow the arrow! --Picard pushes Wesley out of the way of falling rocks, then stops and actually looks up at the rocks before they fall onto him.--When the search party finally finds Picard and Wesley, Dr. Crusher gently wakes Wesley, then they have a hug, and *then* she finally checks if he's OK with her tricorder.All of this artifice is just so we can have a touching moment between Picard and Wesley. But we learn nothing new: Wesley has always worked hard to make Picard proud, and Picard loves Wesley as a son. The only good scene in the episode is when Picard declares how much he envies Wesley going to the Academy and beginning his adventures.",1

Wesley, as usual, comes up with some 'techno-babble' way to deactivate the force-field, thereby saving himself and an injured Picard until the Enterprise eventually finds and rescues them (for most of the episode, they've been dealing with a radioactive garbage scowl that's threatening to poison a planet - so we get a nice little environmental message here as well). Question: Why does this fountain have a force-field around it? It's a deserted moon, no life, no sign of life, except for a big protected drinking fountain. Why would anyone put that there??? Who did put it there???? Even if it was put there by someone else to have a safe water supply, it begs the question - if they left that moon, and planned to return (therefore they have space travel ability) why not just bring water with you when you return?? Also, the amount of water coming from this fountain would indicated a huge underground water source - on a desert moon. The entire concept is absurd. And why wouldn't they just use their phasers a few feet way to dig another path to this underground water source? Why play games with this absurd force-field, that for some reason, has already killed one person? The problem here is, it was created by the writers as a plot device to give Wes something to do, be the hero, and stretch out the story. Usually TNG explains things like this. But here, they all just shrug their shoulders, beam everyone up to the ship and fly away. STUPID.",

So, again, Picard and Wesley take a ship together (as they did in the 2nd season episode ""Samaritan Snare"" - which Wesley also recounts to Picard) so that he can transfer to a vessel that'll take him to the Academy. However, the ship soon experiences a malfunction which causes an emergency landing on a desert planet that barely supports life.It'll take Wesley's skills to save them for their predicament before the Enterprise can return from their mission ""hauling radioactive garbage"".Trivia note: Picard mentions Boothby the groundskeeper to Wesley (a figure that'll be finally seen in ""The First Duty"" played by Ray Walston).",

Like Mark Hamill's newfound appreciation for his Luke Skywalker character, during the last couple of decades he has changed his tune and is proud of his work on the show-- and he should be proud of it.But he probably hates this episode. I noticed that his acting is shaky throughout it. Like most of the people who watched this episode, he probably never bought into its script. Hence, we saw... THAT performance. Who WOULD appreciate this script? A previous reviewer, ""SnydleyDownDeep,"" laid out all of its flaws well. It has too many forced plot devices and inconsistent character actions, and it's just clichéd.I will award three stars to it just because I want to honor a cool guy who played a good role.

5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Final Mission (TV Episode 1990)",Read the other comment about MTS3K,"I am a huge fan of the ST Universe. I love the show and the high standard they usually keep with not having too many plot holes.And then I saw this episode and thought "" what the heck happened here?!"" I agree 100% about viewing this episode like a Mystery Science Theater 3000 show because it is very poorly written and directed. It is quite possibly the most plot-hole-filled episode in all of Star Trek History.Everything the other guy said is 100% true but he missed some crucial plot holes. It's OK, there were so many to keep up with. Mine may bear a little explanation before we begin for clarity. So here we go.Inertia. The Enterprise overcomes inertia with inertial dampeners. A derelict garbage scow would not have active dampeners so it would suffer from inertia, thus how it got to the planet in the first place. At some point somewhere something pushed this garbage scow up to speed, and we assume its trajectory was altered as it ricocheted through myriad gravity wells.I present you my 5 additional plot holes: First, once you have something in tractor if you let go it will continue to go without you any more. Why not go full impulse, grab the thing real quick, fling it forward and release it at a much higher velocity? And there is the slingshot gravity technique. They give coordinates in 3 dimensions and they fly in 2 on Star Trek. Some of this is ILM's fault because it's hard to hang a model vertically right? Second, I have seen them tow starships in warp before in other shows and in other episodes.Third, If it's that easy to send junk into the sun, why didn't the people who made the scow in the first place just fly backwards at the sun, and then stop real quick with the back open, thus letting the garbage free without losing your ship? Fourth, If the Enterprise can't get near the thing, who originally could to sit on the bridge and fly the thing? Fifth, To be a captain you must own a starship or vessel or some type. A captain is a leader of men, yet he had no one under his command. Driving a shuttle, he's more like a pilot, or at best an owner/operator. Calling a guy like that captain would be like a navy captain calling a truck driver captain. Apparently this guy's character was as flat as a board and he only existed as a protagonist, and someone to hate on. Obviously his title was either fashioned by himself (we assume) or the actors were too kind to say anything about this obvious oversight.This episode was written by Kacey Arnold-Ince who consequently has never written anything before or since. If I was an actor on the set I would have said ""write me out of this garbage, I want a personal day"". It feels like the writer wrote this script on a napkin just before filming because they lost the original OR Wil Wheaton said he wanted to leave the show so they wanted to change it real quick and threw away this theoretical original and better episode.Apparently the editors and usual team of crackshots didn't get a chance to shred this script before it was sent to the director.",1
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Final Mission (TV Episode 1990)","Yes, It Is That Bad!","I finished watching this and was astonished at how silly it was. Then I started second guessing things because the recent episodes have been so good. Now, after reading other commentaries, my suspicions have been confirmed. This is a sophomoric plot with enough idiocy to fill its own book. I won't go over all the problems. The two most basic to me are Wesley and Picard being picked up by some ne'er-do-well captain of a rickety shuttle. I suppose the Enterprise shuttles were leased, and they didn't want to put any more miles on them. Then we have the ridiculous scow, floating around in orbit. Unless, I lost all my knowledge of physics, when you reach a point where the gravitational pull is unable to sustain itself, the object floats away. This should have happened a few minutes after the tractor beam got hold of the big piece of junk. I won't even go into the tawdry junk that goes on after the crash. It is embarrassingly syrupy and precious and so unlike something that would represent Picard in this series. Perhaps the script was the prize winner in a junior high creative writing contest.",3

On the negative side, Picard and the shuttle's captain* are also there and they might die as well because the place is a gigantic desert and they have very little water. Too bad it's not the 24th century where they could EASILY find them...no, wait, it IS the 24th century. So, no worries.I noticed that there is a lot of hate directed towards this episode- - with extremely negative reviews here on IMDb. Are they merited? Well, not completely. Some of the 'mistakes' listed seem very nitpicky-- but there clearly ARE some mistakes due to sloppy writing. And, the bromance going on between Picard and Wesley in the cave is kind of nice to watch. Otherwise, the episode is slightly below average but at least of merit since it signals the end of Wesley as a series regular.*Why were Picard and Wesley being transported on a piece of crap shuttle that is just days away from the scrap heap instead of on an Enterprise shuttle or some other Federation ship? This really made no sense. Also, the Captain of the shuttle is among the dumbest and least competent characters I've ever seen on the show...yet the pair ride with him?!

on one rickety old spaceship piloted by miner Nick Tate. On an Enterprise shuttlecraft I doubt they would have crashed on an uninhabited moon.Meanwhile under Jonathan Frakes command they go to the aid of a planet that
leader Kim Hamilton says is being bombarded with radiation. It's an old garbage scow of a spaceship that wandered into their planet's atmosphere and
is leaking radioactive waste. The Enterprise fixes the problem and sends the
scow on its intended destination.At that point Will Ryker hears of Picard and Wesley's disappearance. All I will

But this is principally a farewell to Wesley Crusher and to that end, it's not half bad. Marooned on a desert moon, he finally gets the heart-to- heart with Picard that he needs (and really, after the father drama in 'Family', it was due). He's never been my favorite character, but if you're going to ship him off to the academy,l this is a pretty good send-off.

That this episode was so forgettable, even though I had seen it at least once earlier, thereby having a scintilla of drama in the ending (did they beam up directly from the cave, or were they able to ambulate out?

The captain and Wesley land on a planet that apparently has an atmosphere that contains sufficient oxygen to support human life. Free oxygen cannot exist in an atmosphere unless it is continuously replenished some how. The only known way to put elemental oxygen into an atmosphere is by photosynthesis. The planet they land on looks like Mars, a dry desert with no apparent life. Oxygen is a highly reactive substance. It will react with almost anything it comes in contact with. If photosynthesis ceased all the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere would be gone in a very short period of time. In fact, before photosynthetic organisms evolved, there was no free oxygen in the atmosphere. In order to make this episode believable they should have put some living things there that could produce oxygen by some mechanism. I agree with the other reviewers. This was not a well done or well constructed episode.",4
13,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Final Mission (TV Episode 1990)",the pressure constant..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 04This fourth act of the series lives up to the expectations on terms of bringing out new vivid concepts that are mostly pulled out from the old buried lands, what it unfortunately lacks is the thought provoking ethical dilemmas that were present in the previous season.Final MissionThe isolation that suddenly gives these characters enormous amount of room to pitch in on storytelling is something rare and beautiful to encounter in such a loud busy genre, but this is where all the guns are directed towards, hence the characters in the bridge feels short handed.",
0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Loss (TV Episode 1990)",Ugh,"I have to be honest: I never liked Troi. Her role as the crew's captain obvious and inability to do anything outside that role renders her one of the most worthless characters on the show.So, imagine an episode that takes away her one distinct ability, and then play up her typical self-centered personality, and you get this episode.The Enterprise-D is caught in the pull of two-dimensional beings trying to return home to some gravimetric anomaly. That is the B plot... and you'll find if you watch this episode that it's preferable to the A plot it causes: Troi can't use her empathic abilities. While the crew of the Enterprise undergoes being useful, Troi IMMEDIATELY starts a new counseling technique to compensate for her loss, and that is the technique of acting like a total jerk to everyone who talks to her.Now, I should point out, the AIM the writers had in this episode is noble. Praiseworthy even. Raising awareness and empathy for those who are disabled is important. I'm all for it.However, being disabled is not really justification for abandoning all decorum and acting negatively to others. Troi was supposed to be sympathetic, to show us what it might be like to deal with the sudden loss of natural ability.This is not what happened, because instead Troi immediately erases any hope of being likable and sympathetic by thinking only of her problem and not the fact the Enterprise is in danger, and out and out going off on Picard and the crew when they try to help her so she can help them.The only redeeming moment of the A plot is when Riker confronts her and actually speaks frankly about how he felt it was GOOD she lost her ability. His point was largely to establish that Deanna's not really handicapped by the loss and that she's more or less just like everyone else.That's the other reason this episode fails: Troi doesn't lose anything ""real"" to the viewer. It's not really akin to being blinded or losing the use of a limb. Troi is made ""normal"" by our standards. And she spends much of the episode being upset she's not BETTER than the viewer. This, combined with Riker's assessment, erases the hope of establishing what the writers hoped to do.For most the episode we see the rest of the crew actually making themselves useful in saving the Enterprise. It's not until maybe the last act the writers remembered that Troi's the central character of the story and has done nothing to contribute. This is the other problem with this episode. Troi loses her ONE useful ability and spends most the story moping and NOT helping, even deciding because she's not better than the viewer she can't be counselor anymore.At any rate, eventually the writers shoehorn in Troi actually figuring out an insight that leads to the solution to the B plot. The problem here is that it really doesn't present itself as an insight only Troi could have. In fact, I'd have found the solution more believable coming from Dr. Crusher...In terms of production, it's just as good as any season 4 episode. The cast handle their roles well, and Marina Sirtis is to commended for playing Troi in what is probably one of the most disagreeable Troi stories. The problem is that just because a show is well produced and acted can't really overcome a story that people don't like.Overall, this episode is awful. If you don't like Troi you will NOT like this episode.",2
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Loss (TV Episode 1990)",Deanna at Her Worst,"I have no problem with Deanna Troi going into severe depression when she loses her empathic Betazoid powers after some kind of energy surge. She suddenly realizes that the greatest gift she has has disappeared. I could have accepted her desperation had the plot evolved a bit and time had passed. It's almost as if they were thinking we need to have actual time end in a few hours. For heaven's sake, there are so many physical conditions that take a couple days to heal, like getting your sight back after a blinding flash, or temporary paralysis after a fall. Had she gone into this deep place a month afterward, it might have been more believable. As it is, she begins to attack her friends and whine to her patients. Even in the imaginary world of Star Trek, her responses are portrayed as childish at best. She is also the person who extends comfort to others. How can she be so short sighted. After some quite strong episodes and one clinker, it just doesn't work for me.",5
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Loss (TV Episode 1990)","Well, it's perhaps better than ""Samaritan Snare""","The idea of Troi losing her empathic abilities seems at first thought like a good plot device. After all, that's her defining characteristic. It's what makes her an ""amazing"" ship's counselor. To lose that is to lose everything, right?And so when she loses it, she totally loses it. I mean, she turns into a complete whiny b-word. But we're to believe this is all understandable. She can't do her job, everyone around her seems suddenly different -- it must be incredibly scary!But that's where we start to discover the inherent flaws in the concept. Troi describes herself as handicapped, and to drive the point home, she compares it to being blind. But how accurate is that statement? The reason most people don't want to go blind is that it would put them at a severe disadvantage. Living with blindness is inherently difficult. It is impossible for us to empathize with Troi's dilemma because we don't have her ability. Therefore we do not see her as living with a disadvantage; we see her as losing her advantage, as Riker points out. Now she's one of us, just like everyone else. So get over it!Still, that would be scary, so it's understandable that she would have emotional difficulty. Unfortunately, the entire manifestation of this fear is that she will no longer be able to do her job. Most people who go blind, their first, second or even fiftieth thought is not that they won't be able to do their job. It would have been much more interesting if Troi had tried to reassess her identity as a person. But it's all about her work.Which raises another issue: How ""amazing"" of a counselor can Troi be if she needs to be able to cheat to help people? We've seen her use basic cognitive therapy techniques before, so the idea of needing telepathy to do her job is a stretch to begin with. It seems like the worst that would happen is that she would no longer be on the bridge crew to tell Picard that she senses deception from the alien that just told an obvious lie. That might sting, losing such a prestigious position, but it certainly would not justify her actions in this episode.And if she is so bad at her job that she needs to cheat to be effective at it, how are we supposed to empathize with that? It's like Lance Armstrong complaining that he can't race effectively now that he can't use drugs. Again, just like everyone else.Even the reason for her ""loss"" is suspect. We aren't really given specifics, but apparently Troi's empathic receptors get overloaded when the Enterprise get's caught in a swarm of two-dimensional dot creatures. All those thoughts and emotions. Except the whole point of the solution to that dilemma is that the creatures are not intelligent and act purely on instinct. Isn't this about the same as landing on a planet full of vegetation and microbial life forms? Yet Troi has no problem with that.Okay, I admit it -- that's a lot of thought put into this episode. Not everything has to stand up to scrutiny after the fact. If the episode works while you're watching it, then everything else is second. But this episode doesn't work, because Troi is so awful to everyone...and because we never really share Troi's feelings of loss. We never really see Troi deal with all this, either. Just when it seems like she's about to get a handle on it, she gets her abilities back. Essentially, the show ends at the moment it starts getting interesting!As for the story about the dots, it's actually a nice sci-fi concept, dragged down only by the utter predictability of it all.All in all, a very weak and barely watchable episode.",3

On paper, this is a great idea. But Troi is so badly written as an incessant whiner here that none of that actually works.

It has almost no merit.I will award two stars to it instead of one because even when the Deanna Troi character is at her worst she has flashes of extreme sexiness. But who would want to be near her anyway? She is at her whiniest in this episode. A bit of self-pitying is fine, but when it's taken to the extreme and you're lashing out at good people because ""THEY JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND"" then you're just being a child.Also, the story of the ""two dimensional phenomenon"" that is drawing the Enterprise into its vortex is one of the dullest things in Trek history. Apparently, a seemingly innocuous purple cloud in space (the dramatic music that accompanies its presence is especially humorous) has eliminated Deanna's powers, yet she wants to resign and be done with the entire ship before they even handled the problem. It was the utter nadir of stupidity for her to be so reactionary so quickly. It reminded me of a comedy in which someone torches a building or some other extreme thing because he misinterpreted something, then he when he realizes his mistake he just grins stupidly and shrugs his shoulders. Who could regard such a person with any degree of respect ever again? I'm watching the entire ""Next Generation"" series.

Next Gen especially, though it could be said for Star Trek in general, has a fabulous way of keeping us thinking long after the episode has ended.I found myself mulling a similar question. What was more two-dimensional: the beings the Enterprise encountered, or Marina Sirtis' acting? In this episode, we find ourselves presented with an entity that is purely driven by an instinctive urge, wrapping the Enterprise up and causing havoc in the process. Much like a moth to a flame, a duck to water, or women to Patrick Stewart, it relies purely on an ineffable need to reach its end goal. This entity, of course, is Marina Sirtis. Troi bumbles from one scene to another, shrieking utterances between unconvincing sobs, moodily swinging between camera shots until the final curtain mercifully blesses this episode. Coincidentally, there is also a sub-plot about some space things trying to reach a star or something and that's how it ends.Worth watching for the sixth time if you're feeling particularly masochistic or just have a bit of time on your hands. 2/10: you tried.",2

I get that she was going through denial, anger, etc. but they overdid it, and I mean REALLY overdid it, and she came across as so self-pitying, whiny, unreasonable and downright childish I don't see how the crew could ever have respected her again. After all, the crew of the Enterprise was supposed to be Starfleet's very best and brightest. And part of being the best is how you cope with adversity.

If the writers had used even the slightest modicum of subtlety in the way they portrayed Troi handling her loss, the episode would have been so much more effective. It's a shame because it was a concept worth exploring, but it was ruined by ham-fisted writing.Having said that, the episode was not without entertainment value. My son and I have been re-watching the series on Netflix and we literally laughed out loud at Troi's over-the-top petulance and complete lack of self-awareness. I think my favorite may have been the meeting in the observation lounge:LAFORGE: It's a shame we can't tell if they're sentient.TROI: What do you mean by that?! I'm doing the best that I can!!

We've seen other Betazoids act irrationally (Troi's patient) or immaturely (Troi's mother). Maybe that behavior is her Betazoid side? What did anger me was her reaction to Guinan saying she wants to be the new councilor. She pretty much scoffed at the idea and told her she couldn't handle it. That was just b..chy.

In this episode, it is revealed that the Federation and Cardassians have been at war for years and have only recently (a year go) signed a peace treaty.However, there is a rogue captain, Maxwell of the Phoenix, who starts destroying Cardassian ships seemingly for no reason. Maxwell, whom O'Brien has served with, lost his whole family during a battle on Setlick and Picard now thinks he's up to revenge. He enlists O'Brien's help (along with 3 Cardassians including Gul Macet) in trying to persuade his former captain to stand down, but in the process must confront his own demons.This episode brings to question, when you were in war for so long, can you find a role in peace (the same question that the samurai had during the Tokugawa era after the long civil war period of Japanese history)? Trivia note: Marc Alaimo plays Gul Macet (he will soon play a memorable Cardassian named Gul Dukat on Deep Space Nine). And you see O'Brien and Keiko having dinner together, the first time we see them AFTER the wedding from the previous episode. And it is noted that Picard first met the Cardassians while on the Stargazer, and under not-so-peaceful circumstances.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Wounded (TV Episode 1991)",Introducing the Bloody Cardies,"What really bugged me about this was that The Cardassians had been DROPPED into the Future History of Trek from basically out of nowhere. Not only had we never seen these ugly guys, suddenly O'Brien had this story about Setlik 3 he starts telling.Apparently ""The Cardassian War"" had been over for a couple of years, when The Enterprise D first pulled out of The Utopia Plenicia Shipyards. But until this episode we had seen not hide nor hair nor even the spoons in their skulls.Bob Gunton is Captain Benjamin Maxwell, who had been stuffing some Cardy-related emotions and now he is out of control, he goes into Cardy space and starts blowing up ships and space stations.So as The D enters Cardy space and Gul Macet (Marc Alaimo) starts shooting at them, Picard is handed a worm can that he has to fix.But in Maxwell's Mind, he is not doing anything wrong. In fact, the Cardassian War never ended for him.The problem is, Maxwell is right, but he's going about it the wrong way. How do we deal with a guy named Maxwell? We need a guy named O'Brien. But before O'Brien can help Maxwell, he has to face his own prejudices- Which he does by finally sitting with a Cardy who is just trying to be friendly and drinking some Kanar with him- And admitting what the Cardy War had made him become.It takes O'Brien sneaking onto Maxwell's ship and confronting him about Setlik 3. And a song:""The Minstrel Boy to the War hath gone, In the ranks of death you will find him. His father's sword he hath girded on, And his wild harp slung behind him.""This song was used to define Miles Edward O'Brien for the rest of his stay on The Enterprise and also on Deep Space Nine.",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Wounded (TV Episode 1991)",One of the best,"This episode is just awesome. What I like most about this episode is that it does not leave one feeling like what was right necessarily took effect. Tom Gunton (the warden in shawshank redemption) does a fabulous job as a guest star as another star ship captain in this one. The episode introduces the Kardasians, and creates a terrific conflict between the Enterprise, the Kardasians, and another star ship captain who's about as respected as Picard in Star fleet. This episode deals with the enterprise in conflict with starfleet itself,, which is a concept that creates many great episodes, and in my opinion should have been utilized more. The other captain attacks the kardasians without approval, because he believes them untrustworthy, and secretly preparing for war with the federation. Picard and the enterprise partner with some Kardasians to halt the seemingly unprovoked attack. In the end the other captain is taken into custody of the enterprise, thanks largely to chief O'Brien's negotiations with the other captain whom he used to serve under. At the end however, Picard realizes that the Kardasians were being deceptive, as the other captain suspected. The episode leaves the viewer wondering at the end whether the Kardasians or the other starfleet ship was a bigger negative threat, and the uncertainty makes a strong statement about the difficulty of making the correct moral decision between two negative forces. Overall, this is one of the top 10 episodes in my book. The only thing that bothers me is the unrealistically conflict of cultural food between O'Brien and his new wife. In the episode it's like their first meal together is after they got married.",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Wounded (TV Episode 1991)",Great script and acting,"This episode represents to me what is special about Star Trek – namely that it focuses on the people and characterizations and plot lines as opposed to massive displays of special effects. The plot here focuses on legendary star fleet captain Ben Maxwell, who can't put his war demons and personal tragedies behind him. These demons compel him to go rogue with his powerful starship against his old enemies, with whom he should now officially be at peace. Picard and the crew of the Enterprise are sent to corral Maxwell and preserve the peace. Among his crew, O'Brien struggles with his affection for Maxell, his former commander, and must also confront his own war demons.I love confrontations between characters that showcase a strong script and strong acting. The best such confrontations not only advance the story but yield strong truths about the characters to each other and to us. The very best provide fundamental truths about human nature itself. There are several great confrontations in this episode. All of them showcase excellent understated acting:  Picard and Maxwell verbally fence with each other in their first confrontation. Picard is quiet but forceful, simply questioning Maxwell into a corner.  O'Brien and his former enemy sharing drinks in a bar as they unravel their own baggage. O'Brien shares an epiphany for him and us, and maybe for many a war veterans. ""It's not you I hate. I hate what I became because of you."" Let that sink in. Powerful.  The best such exchange is in the climax when O'Brien quietly talks Maxwell back from the brink. His combination of reminiscence and the minstrel melody are perfect, leading to the saddest exchange – ""I'm not gonna win this one, am I Miles?"" ""No sir"". Nothing more needs to be said. They and we are left with the realization that the collapse of a once great man was now complete.  Picard's dressing down of Gul Macet at the end is a surprise plot twist as well as a way to put the entirety of events and people into the proper context.Dialogue reigns supreme here. Bob Gunton is terrific as Maxwell and is easy to like and care about. Patrick Stewart also shines here, as he does so often. The real gem in this episode, though, is Colm Meaney as O'Brien. The episode has its flaws, the biggest of which is Picard releasing Maxwell back to his ship. Big tactical error, but then we would not have had the dénouement with O'Brien. I also can't figure out how going from a tactical officer to a transporter chief is a logical career progression for O'Brien. Still, what a treat to see such a strong script delivered so effectively.",8
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Wounded (TV Episode 1991)",Great Episode and a Worthy Introduction of the Cardassians,"A respected Starfleet captain has gone rogue and started destroying ships and bases belonging to the newly-introduced Cardassians, threatening the fragile peace with them. The Enterprise is ordered to hunt him down and ""preserve the peace, no matter the cost."" This is easily one of my favorite episodes of any Star Trek series for many reasons. It introduces us to the Cardassians, who are probably the most interesting alien race in Star Trek. They make for an excellent case study of humanity because they are probably the most human of all the major Star Trek races. The Klingons are too hot; the Romulans are too cold; and the Vulcans are colder still. The Cardassians are just right. The Cardassians also seem to be completely on par with humans in terms of abilities; they are equally intelligent, equally strong physically, and have no special powers that humans lack. Basically, they are just ugly humans with cooler uniforms. Because of this, it's safe to say that their society is exactly what the Federation would be if it was ruled by a military dictatorship. On top of that, the Cardassians have many admirable qualities; their dedication to family being the one that stands out the most. In all, they are a great race for storytelling purposes and my personal favorites of all.We also get our first glimpse of Marc Alaimo (AKA Gul Dukat) in this episode. Alaimo is an excellent actor--in particular his voice drips with emotion and rhetorical flair without ever going overboard--and his character of Dukat is easily the best villain Star trek has ever had. His character in this episode, Macet, is essentially just Dukat by a different name; he posses the same arrogance, charm, and love with the sound of his own voice that audiences will eventually come to love and hate about Dukat. It's a juicy teaser of things to come on Deep Space Nine.This episode stands out too in being the first to heavily feature Colm Meany in his role as Chief O'Brien. Those who have seen Deep Space Nine already know that Meany is an incredible actor, but the job he does on this episode is spectacular even for him. His rapport with, well, basically everyone is almost uncanny. He makes Chief O'Brien so human and relatable that the viewer will wish they could sit in Ten Forward and have a drink with him. In particular, his scene with the Cardassian in Ten-For and his scene with Maxwell on the Phoenix are where he gets to show the true reach of his acting talents. As you can see, this episode obviously does a lot to set up for Deep Space Nine. The Cardassians, Marc Alaimo, and Chief O'Brien will all play major roles in that show and they all give an enticing glimpse in this episode of what a great show DS9 will eventually become.But all the great lore and setup for DS9 aside, this episode is great in its own right. The action is compelling and the suspense is gripping. The story is very tight and well-written. But most of all, the dialog and the acting are off the scales. There's so many great scenes (basically every single one), but here are some of the best:-O'Brien and the Cardies in the turbolift-O'Brien and Maxwell in the transporter room-Maxwell and Picard in the ready room-O'Brien and Maxwell on the Phoenix-Picard and Macet in the final sceneThe last two scenes are particularly great, ranking #2 and #1 respectively in my book. I love how O'Brien barely says anything to Maxwell but somehow his presence is calming to the point that it causes Maxwell to see reason on his own. And when they sadly sing the minstrel boy song with their thousand-yard stares--haunting and beautiful. This great episode saves the best for last, though. After putting up with Macet's insufferable arrogance for the entire episode--and always doing so with a smile on his face--Picard finally gets to tell Macet off. Even surrounded by great actors like Meany and Alaimo, Patrick Stewart manages to shine here as he delivers his stern warning to Macet, ""Take this message back to your leaders...we are watching."" When he holds that intense stare for a few seconds and then silently turns his back to Macet, it's spine-tingling. Perfect way to end this episode.THE GOOD:-The acting, dialog, suspense, lore, story, characters, and everything else listed aboveTHE BAD:-O'Brien's career progression makes no sense and the writers and producers did a horrible job of figuring out his position in Starfleet. First he's the tactical officer on the Rutledge (which is the position Worf has on the 1701-D), then he is a mere transporter technician with a noncommissioned officer rank on the Enterprise, then he's a chief engineer on DS9. Makes zero sense.-Re-uses bad trope that recurs throughout Star Trek--that of a ""very highly respected"" captain in Starfleet going off the deep end.THE UGLY:-The Cardassian's complete incompetence in this episode makes me wonder how they ever were considered a threat to the Federation. Picard gives their warship the ability to disarm the Phoenix, they get in the first shot, and they STILL get obliterated. Pretty pathetic showing for them.-The Cardassians' uniforms. Literally ugly. Fortunately this is the only episodes for those uniforms and the ones they use in DS9 are actually some of the coolest-looking uniforms in all of Star Trek. But holy Prime Directive are they ugly in this one.-The window in the Phoenix's shields that allows O'Brien to beam through seems like a fatal flaw for a vessel to have. An enemy could beam a bomb through that gap and destroy the vessel.",10
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Wounded (TV Episode 1991)",Past wars and inner rage,"I have to confess that the Cardassians have never been my cup of tea; it's part of the reason I've never taken to Deep Space Nine. As I understand it, 'The Wounded' serves as their official introduction, and it's evident why Marc Alaimo was brought back later in a larger role; the guy's got screen presence, heavy makeup notwithstanding.The virtues of this episode lie in the acting and writing, both well done. We've seen a rogue starship captain before, but Capt. Maxwell (Bob Gunton, making the most of a one-shot) isn't a typical sufferer of space madness. This is a grief-stricken skipper who doesn't accept a peace treaty as a reason to stand down. And who better to talk him down than former crewman Chief I'Brien (great use of a minor character). Theirs is a powerful bonding scene between two comrades in arms, and it's a heartfelt story overall.8/10",8

It must have been hard for war veterans of World War II to embrace the Japanese after the conflict ended. In this one we are introduced, for the first time, to the Kardassians. They have formed an alliance with the Federation but are now seeking retribution for the actions of a rogue Starfleet Captain. A supposed, Kardassian ""scientific"" outpost has been obliterated by a Federation starship. Picard has orders to investigate and to solve it by peaceful means. This, of course, ties his hands but in the meantime, the same vessel destroys two other Kardassian crafts. The Captain is intercepted and ordered to bring his ship in and surrender himself to his superiors. At first he acquiesces, but soon alters course and heads for another Kardassian supply ship. Now, Picard must negotiate or open fire on a ship like his own. As a show of good faith, the Kardassian captain and two of his aides have had a limited run of the ship. They are at odds with the crew and acting victimized. I believe that Patrick Steward as Jean-Luc Picard gives his best performance in this episode. It is about balancing the threat of reprisal versus the future of the bond between these two entities. Later, in other Star Trek incarnations, we come to know the Kardassians quite well and know them to be anything but trustworthy. They have a certain charm that the Romulans don't have that allows them to slime their way into situations that benefit them.",10

They are easily rebuffed but Picard demands to know why they were attacked--after all, there is a peace treaty between the two empires. It turns out that this attack was in response by an attack by a Federation ship on the Cardassians. Picard finds this very hard to believe but agrees to investigate. When he learns that this is TRUE, he has no choice but to help the Cardassians seek out this rogue ship.While nothing super-exciting happens in this one, it's an important and must-see episode because so much follows this one.

1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Devil's Due (TV Episode 1991)",Hilarious!,"Normally, my favorite episodes of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" are those with are monumental in scope--and are often two-parters involving the Borg or Klingons. However, there are a few standalone episodes that are truly wonderful. They don't relate to any other episodes but they are nonetheless terrific. The best of these, clearly, is ""The Inner Light"", but another wonderful one, with a VERY different mood, is ""Devil's Due"".The episode begins with the Enterprise being brought to a planet after some Federation folks are kidnapped (this is a rather frequent theme, by the way). WHY this occurred is a trip. It seems that the planet's version of the Devil is coming...and in a panic, the people will do anything--even kidnap Federation staff. Picard is a bit annoyed by all this but his annoyance grows exponentially when this devil appears before him and the leader of the planet! This incredibly cool and rather sexy being announces that she's come to collect her due...and her due is the planet as well as anything orbiting it--which includes the Enterprise. What follows is a silly ""Devil and Daniel Webster"" sort of court case in which Picard tries to invalidate the contract with this 'lady'--but really it's just a delay tactic in order to allow LaForge to seek out the source of this woman's magical and very formidable powers!So why did I like this episode so much? Well, it's something most episodes of the series never were...FUN. The performance of Marta Dubois as this evil and mythical 'Ardra' was simply delicious. While a bit over-the-top, it was done in such a fun and seductive manner that I was simply captivated by her...and you wonder why Picard didn't just shut up and give his soul to her!

She literally steals this whole episode.The enterprise receives an urgent distress call from some scientists on Ventax II, look for another notable performance from character actor Paul Lambert who is in the movies planet of the apes, Spartacus, and all the presidents men. He is the one who implies, when Picard asks, that the danger is coming from Ardra, who is for all intents and purposes, ""the devil"".And Marta is a remarkable ""Devil"", she plays the part with gusto and enthusiasm, as well as some very nice costumes. When she appears in Picard's quarters, she is the epitome of the word ""sexy"".And so we have another courtroom drama like we had with ""the measure of a man"", Picard challenges her claim on Ventax II, which by now includes anything that was in orbit, including the enterprise and everybody in there.And, it appears that she can enforce her claim, it does not seem like there is anything the enterprise or any member thereof can do to stop her from doing what she wants to do, she can change her form, she can move people around at will, she can cause earthquakes on the planet, and she can even make the enterprise completely vanish. How do you fight somebody with powers like that, is she another member of the Q continuum?The answer to these questions is hilarious, as Picard ensues a legal fencing match.

You have a culture that had incredible strife a thousand years previous to the events of this episode. In their mythology, the planetary inhabitants believe that a female figure named Ardra will come back, requiring quid pro quo for saving their civilization. She shows up and is quite formidable. She is able to shape-shift and make the world vibrate. She also teases Picard and makes his life uncomfortable. In retrospect, she might have done better, leaving him alone or at least using a lighter touch. The people on the planet have evolved so far technologically and culturally and have turned into complete idiots when it comes to their religion.

1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Clues (TV Episode 1991)",An M&M mystery,"Who doesn't love a mystery? Picard loves them so much that he creates them in his spare time in the form of Dixon Hill stories on the holodeck. This time his recreation is cut short with a deep space mystery -- a class M planet where none should be. When the Enterprise investigates, a wormhole knocks everyone unconscious...all except Data, who tells the captain they were out for 30 seconds.Strangely, though, circumstances start popping up that point to a much longer period of unaccounted activity -- a full day to be exact. Crusher's seed experiment shows unexplained growth. Troi is going insane. Worf is whining about his broken wrist (when did that happen?). The ship's chronometer has been reset. And so on. Data sends out a probe to prove that there is nothing amiss, but his tale is unraveling quickly.As it becomes clear that Data is lying, Picard decides that he would rather risk the crew's safety than to let Data face a court martial. (Sure, it's the writers' fault, but it's decisions like this that make me realize I would much rather serve under Kirk than Picard, but I digress...) It's all a very fascinating mystery with higher stakes than one might have expected at the beginning. Then, like those lettered candies that are so colorful to look at, it completely dissolves when you actually try to savor it.The Enterprise crew returns to the site of the wormhole and we discover that logic has departed this outing completely. You see, this all came about because there were energy aliens who live on or near that class M planet. And they like their privacy, so when their attempt to knock everyone unconscious failed, they decided to kill everyone on board the Enterprise. For some reason they possessed Troi to explain all this to Picard. And just to prove they are superior, they demonstrated that Troi's body is much stronger when possessed. But Picard talked them out of the ""kill everybody"" plan, and instead the crew agreed to get their memories erased, and then they hatched a plan to fool themselves into believing none of it ever happened. But Data remembered, so he had to promise to keep it all a secret.Say what?!Oh, but it gets better! Of course, it didn't work, so now the aliens again want to kill them. No, wait! Picard convinces (???) the aliens that they'll get it right this time. He promises. The first time was a rehearsal. The mistake the crew made was leaving clues behind. This time, they won't question a missing 2+ days' time (apparently wormholes just do that kind of thing). This time Troi won't go crazy (even though she just got possessed for a second time). This time they'll replant Crusher's seeds and somehow won't notice any are missing. I suppose they'll restock the probe, too. But it doesn't really matter because if they get it wrong Picard will just talk his way out of it again.Don't get me wrong: I absolutely LOVED this episode -- until the end. The end was a cop-out. It was obvious the writers had put themselves in a position they couldn't get out of. I think they must have realized it, too, because they gloss over everything that's wrong at that point. Most telling is that Guinan, after appearing at the beginning, is not even mentioned in the main part of the episode, which is especially interesting since we know (from ""Yesterday's Enterprise"") that she can sense time disturbances that humans can't.Oh well, it's only a problem if you want your puzzles to have a logical solution.

And then the whole thing happens again, making them loose a total of two days. An entirely untenable situation that cannot last longer than the first communication to a Federation star base. That base will of course be two days ahead of the Enterprise, which will once again lead to an examination of Data and the transporter, and would probably also lead to the Enterprise revisiting the Paxan home-world for the third time.

2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" First Contact (TV Episode 1991)",Not a perfect episode,"...but a very good one. I like the way it mirrors several actual ""alien mysteries"" and that it shows reasonable reasons for not having had the ""first contact"" ourselves yet...I'd like to refer to some of the ""plot holes"" ShogaNinja mentioned: ""Secondly, if Riker was on the planet for months doing acculturation research where was the Enterprise during this time?"" It was never said that Riker was there ""for months"". His mission was to contact the starfleet observers on the planet to get prepared for the first contact. And that certainly doesn't require ""months"".About ambassadors not carrying weapons: I'm sure they DO have weapons - in case they have to defend themselves.""Also why do humans always conduct First Contact, why not Vulcans or any of the vast myriad of alien races that belong to the Federation of Planets? More specifically why is it always the Enterprise initiating First Contact?"" When or where is it said so?? I think we can assume that Starfleet is huge - and that we don't get to know each and every ""first contact""! This series is focused on the adventures of the Enterprise. There might be thousand other stories to tell within the Starfleet universe.But indeed, there ARE plot holes in this episode. Two of which I think haven't been mentioned before: 1) Since the Arkonians do not have fingers, we should see huge consoles, keyboards and buttons... 2) If the people of a planet regard themselves ""the center of the universe"", why would they call this planet Malcor THREE themselves...?",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" First Contact (TV Episode 1991)",We come in peace...,"Commander Riker is observing the Arkonians. However, to do so and remain unobserved, he's had cosmetic surgeries, as the society does not yet realize that there are any other beings out there in space. But, this society soon will have warp drives and will be able to learn for themselves about the Federation and other worlds. So, in anticipation of this, Riker is observing. Unfortunately, he's badly injured...and the Arkonian doctors are astonished to see that he's not one of them! This forces the Federation to speed up first contact, and so Picard lands and meets with one of their top scientists and then their leader. But, amazingly, the leader is NOT that excited about first contact. It seems that his society is very ego-centric and the notion that anyone else could exist in the universe is something many will not accept. So, he is torn--between publicly acknowledging that aliens indeed do exist or remaining willingly ignorant of the outside worlds.So much of this episode has parallels to Earth since the late 1940s when stories of UFOs first began circulating. This, and the odd reaction to aliens of the people make this one well worth seeing.",7
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" First Contact (TV Episode 1991)",Solid Episode,"The kinky scene between Bebe Neuwirth's alien character and Riker is humorous and enjoyable enough in itself to rate this show positively.But I also loved the intellectual, deep moments of crisis with the alien civilization and its technological advances and journeys into space, which obviously parallel humanity's advances.The Star Trek crew is informed a few times by an alien that her culture views its world as the center of the universe. Prior to the discoveries of Galileo, Tycho Brae and other legendary scientists, humanity had the same view.I really enjoyed this one.",8
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" First Contact (TV Episode 1991)",Best Stand Alone Episode in the Star Trek Universe.,"I watch this episode for the third time in a lifetime before writing this review because I felt that this was the best episode yet written about the Star Trek Universe. I tip my hat to the writers of this episodeThe story can be summarized easily; Enterprise is coordinating first contact with a planet. Cmdr. Riker, in partial disguise, is injured and discovered in a hospital. First contact begins as an attempt to help find Riker and not ruin the hopeful friendship with a world. The outcome of events force the leader of this species to make the decision that his people were not ready to learn that they are not the center of the universe. There was so much depth in the wisdom and disappointment of the actor who played the race's leader. I gave it 10/10 stars because I thought it was a perfect mesh of great writing and excellent acting both from the cast and the guest stars. If you are introducing someone who is new to the Star Trek Universe, I would suggest using this episode because it is the perfect introduction to the depth and beauty of the The Federation. A part of the universe, in a coalition, with the wisdom to respect the request to back off when asked. Knowing it was in the best interest of everyone to wait and let this species mature before introducing them to the rest of the universe.",10
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" First Contact (TV Episode 1991)",Politics at the Cosmic Level,"This is a decent episode because it takes into account the realities of a culture facing a quantum leap into the future. Riker is the focus. He has been genetically altered to look like an inhabitant so he can keep track of a group of similar agents. Unfortunately, he is caught in the middle of a riot and badly injured. This planet has been selected for First Contact and his presence may compromise this. At the top of the planetary political system are doubter and zealots. They are seriously at odds. It is obvious that the people of the planet are reactionary and suspicious. Debate goes on. Picard beams down and meets a woman who is spearheading the use of Warp Drive. She is brought on board the ship. Meanwhile, the leader of the council must balance on a political tightrope, carefully watching what is going on with Riker. Things go from bad to worse. One of the opposition is frightened of the Federation taking over the planet and will do anything to stop the process. Picard must use all his diplomatic wiles to try to get the show on the road, but there are big obstacles. Still, this is really an episode about the realities of new human encounters. Good episode.",7

The Federation have been closely monitoring this planet with away teams in disguise and Commander Riker had the misfortune of getting injured. He is eventually discovered to be an alien and the Hospital is thrown into uproar among the Security and Medical staff. Picard and Troi make contact with Mirasta Yale, a Scientist and she agrees to help locate Riker. The Planet's leader is then contacted and he is in awe of the Enterprise. Alas, Nayrok, the Security man causes trouble and feigns his own death,attempting to make it look like Riker had killed him. The planet's leader shares some Château Picard with Jean Luc and wistfully asks him to leave as they are not ready for contact with an alien world and the Enterprise departs, taking Mirasta Yale with them at her request.

8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" First Contact (TV Episode 1991)",Nice twist,"I've always enjoyed sci-fi where aliens make contact with 'earthlings'.This is a refreshing and thought-provoking episode where 'earthlings' are the ones to make first contact with another species.The downside is the side-story involving Riker/Jonathan Frakes (horrible actor, in my opinion), which isn't very good at all, as with most stories where he is the lead character.But as for the main story alone - the 'First Contact'-part - I rate this as one of my favorite TNG episodes ever, and I've watched it many times.Highly recommendable if you like sci-fi where 'earthlings' interact with foreign species for the first time, or vice-versa.These kind of episodes are the reason I watch sci-fi in the first place, to learn how writers picture us (humans) or another species to react to each other upon first contact.",7
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" First Contact (TV Episode 1991)",Fear of change,"'First Contact' is classic science fiction - a race of people facing the discovery of alien life - except the aliens in this case are Starfleet personnel; it's a clever twist on the exploration theme. And with Riker's life hanging in the balance, there's more suspense here than I'd expected.But it's the little things here and there that really caught my interest. Like hearing about the reasons for instituting the Prime Directive in the first place (and how it could've avoided a centuries-long war with the Klingons, for example). It's nice to see some development of the theory rather than just wielding it as an excuse not to take action. And I got a ""Star Trek VI"" feeling with a certain faction of the Malcorians fearing relations with a new race and suddenly losing their place at the center of the universe. Even a ""Star Trek IV"" vibe with one of them staying on the Enterprise as the episode winds down.I really liked this; nice execution.8/10",8
10,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" First Contact (TV Episode 1991)",Do you reveal the BIG picture?,"The topic of this episode is fascinating.

They are traders, but they will endeavor to gain the utmost advantage in any trade deals to the point of exploitation.""Durken: ""I'm sure we have many shrewd trader negotiators on our world.""Picard: ""And then there are the Borg.""Picard shows video footage of a Borg cube and the normal greeting the Borg give.Durken: ""Captain, what do you suggest we do to speed up our warp program, and when may we join the Federation?""Picard smiles.- - - - - - - -The question is, would revealing such things actually have the opposite effect. Would it make a species decide to avoid space travel altogether. Would they cease any kind of industrial activity that could attract attention from beings such as the Borg?",10
11,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" First Contact (TV Episode 1991)",major plot holes and contradictory concepts revealed,"This episode contains plot holes. They are pretty significant so I would like to point them out.First off, there is no way that the Enterprise could conduct this mission without a cloaking device. I suggest that keeping cloaking technology from Starfleet would be impossible. If you are at war with a race you will inevitably capture their technology in battle and gain an intelligence coup. The Federation has been at war with both the Klingons and the Romulans yet it has never acquired the technology. If you use it on the enemy, there is a chance the enemy will get it and use it on you. In a world of limitless resources the concept that prevents American technology from being turned against us will not work. As of now it doesn't matter if you take our stuff, you don't have the resources to build enough of them yourself to pose a threat, it's useless to you. This would check/balance would not exist in the ST universe. You could say that you would reveal your technology very carefully for this reason. If your technology falls into enemy hands they can replicate it all day long without so much as understanding how it works. In short, you would protect your tech more than you do now, but there really would be very little you can do to stop the inevitable leaking of your technology to other alien races. Thus, there is no reason why Starfleet shouldn't all be cloaking. Secondly, if Riker was on the planet for months doing acculturation research where was the Enterprise during this time? Are we to believe it sat in orbit out of sight while it conducted this mission? The Atkonians are supposedly on the cusp of warp travel I assume they have sub-light drive technology, satellites and of course telescopes. That would make it quite difficult for the Enterprise to do anything without being discovered since as I pointed out above they cannot cloak. With satellites and telescopes of our own as sub-warp aliens, we could tell the second an uncloaked alien ship entered our Solar System even with our vastly inferior to Starfleet technology.Seems to me that an exploration vessel is designed to explore, and that diplomatic ships would be sent to deal with Atkonians. That would be like sending Columbus to initiate a mission of peace with the Native Americans. Columbus had weaponry. Most ambassadors I know of do not carry weaponry as a rule to peace talks or ever for that matter. How can peace exist in the face of firepower? More often, history shows us, that like Krola believes, explorers are usually conquerers. In 300 years on Earth(the difference between us in the here and now, and the Enterprise in 2366) there really is very little difference of the baser instincts of man despite our ""civilization."" Evolution takes longer than 300 years, history reveals. The concept of a First Contact is flawed in it's very concept for that reason. You cannot force evolution to occur thousands of times faster than it would naturally. Even with the introduction of superior technology, the baser instincts would case war or other disruptions in the balance of power. If you are not evolved enough to use the technology the results would be catastrophic. Just by revealing themselves, they reveal the concepts of technology that can be recreated by the Atkonians. For example, if the Iraqis saw microwave non-lethal emitters, they may not have them but now they know about them they are that much easier to re-invent. By just mingling with Atkonians it would greatly accelerate their technology levels far faster than evolution could keep up. It would be disastrous. Especially with a xenophobic race like the Atkonians. Are we to believe that when they get phasers that they won't use them on all the ugly foreign aliens that have fingers and toes?Lastly, if they can change Riker's face why couldn't they change his hands and feet to make him more genuine. Latex gloves perhaps? Also why do humans always conduct First Contact, why not Vulcans or any of the vast myriad of alien races that belong to the Federation of Planets? More specifically why is it always the Enterprise initiating First Contact? Sometimes the way certain writers script this show they would have you believe that the Starship Enterprise is the only ship in the Federation, and they singlehandedly take care of every single emerging Federation problem. Other times they raise more questions about the series than the value of the story they are trying to tell. It can make the show very campy at times.",7
12,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" First Contact (TV Episode 1991)","Problems with the episode, and even more with the reviews","First, many reviewers refer to Arkonians. The planet is Malcor III (spelling subject to speculation).That leads into the YATIs (Yet Another Trek Inconsistency).Picard and Troi greet Minister Yale as Mirasta, as do ALL the Malcorians. When introducing Durkin and Dr Yale to Data, Picard pronounces her name as Mirista. Also, Mirasta knows about Data being an android without (apparently) having met him (minor picky point).Dr Crusher reports from the medical facility that Krola is a Marconian male. No, he's Malcorian.QA was either not working, or they just thought no one would catch these errors.Finally, Dr Lilith Sternin (Lanel) seduces Riker in one of the most idiotic bits of wink-wink pandering I've ever seen.Overall, this is a good episode.

13,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" First Contact (TV Episode 1991)",it must be destructive..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 04This fourth act of the series lives up to the expectations on terms of bringing out new vivid concepts that are mostly pulled out from the old buried lands, what it unfortunately lacks is the thought provoking ethical dilemmas that were present in the previous season.First ContactA smart update to the usual mission-gone-wrong case as it starts off as an aftermath, that allows new characters to blend in on the narration along with the old supporters helping in to set the clock at zero with a hope for of course no scratch possible.",

Therefore, it's a shock to him that she turns out to be cold and only caring about ""her engines"".Geordi and Leah's conflicts to each other are put to the test when they must find a way to get a new alien lifeform baby off the hull of the Enterprise, where it has been ""feeding"" off of.Trivia note: Whoopi Goldberg makes another appearance as Guinan.

Oddly, he became infatuated with her and so when he learns that the REAL Dr. Brahms is coming to see him and the ship, he is excited. When she arrives, Geordi cannot contain his excitement--and he continually makes overtures towards her. Perhaps 'overtures' isn't quite right--more like sexual harassment by his creepy tone and sense of entitlement. I could EASILY see a woman macing a guy who acts like this or getting him fired or reprimanded--and you'd think this sort of boorish behavior would not be tolerated in the 24th century!As for the rest of the show, it's a pretty dull affair involving some flying space slug...or something. All in all, a very poor and incredibly creepy episode--one that has only gotten creepier since its debut.",3
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Galaxy's Child (TV Episode 1991)",An Exploration of Self-Restraint That Ultimately Misses the Mark,"Everyone has fantasies. Everyone who is familiar with the concept of the holodeck has explored its possibilities. Everyone has imagined using the holodeck to make fantasies reality, even fantasies involving other real human beings, friends, strangers, celebrities, you name it. For this reason, it is important to explore just how far the average person might take it and the ethics of doing so. TNG rightly attempts to tackle this difficult concept in this episode and others (namely S3E6, ""Booby Trap,"" and S3E21, ""Hollow Pursuits"") but ultimately shies away from delving too deeply into the psyche.In this episode, Lt. Commander Geordi LaForge finally gets to meet the engineer chiefly responsible for designing the Enterprise's warp drive system, Dr. Leah Brahms. Of course, he has met her before, in a sense, in the aforementioned season three episode, ""Booby Trap,"" when he creates a program simulating her likeness on the holodeck in order to work through a difficult engineering problem. It is implied that Geordi engages in a reasonably tame but somewhat romantic relationship with the holodeck version of Dr. Brahms—a relationship that can't be described as entirely professional, in any event. ""Every time you're touching the engine, you're touching me."" As a result of his virtual encounters, Geordi expects the possibility of a romantic relationship with the real Dr. Brahms during her visit to the Enterprise.As it turns out, Dr. Brahms isn't exactly interested in Geordi the way he had hoped. In fact, the first thing she does is berate him for having ""fouled up {her} engine designs."" Nevertheless, Geordi continues to pursue her, asking her at one point to meet him is his quarters and passing up no opportunity to take advantage of every piece of knowledge he gleaned from her personal records in order to gain her favor (I had to Google fugilli). Ultimately, she discovers the questionable holodeck program, and this is where the episode falls short of its goals.Although the show makes an effort to suggest that Geordi never engaged in any sexual or otherwise inappropriate behavior on the holodeck with the simulated Dr. Brahms, we and the real Leah Brahms are asked simply to take Geordi at his word. Given the candor with which LaForge interacts with Brahms in his holodeck program in ""Booby Trap"" in addition to his expressed hopes to spark a flame with her in this episode, it's reasonable for any audience to infer that Geordi could be lying about his behavior. It would certainly be far more interesting if he were lying, but Brahms unrealistically believes that he has exercised self-control on the holodeck and that her likeness was never violated. Beyond that, she ends the episode not only forgiving him for what could be pretty salacious invasions of her privacy but congenially apologizing to him for her behavior.From a plot perspective, I left the episode disappointed in the lack of consequences for Geordi, but I was mostly disappointed in the show's reluctance to investigate the insight into human nature that they had at their fingertips.",6
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Galaxy's Child (TV Episode 1991)",Geordi's Lucky to Keep His Job,"Leah Brahm's, one of the engineer's involved in the creation of the Enterprise, makes a return engagement, this time as a real person. Geordi, during a serious crisis, created a holodeck program so he could work with the beautiful young engineer. In that episode, he had the hots for her, and made her into a more compliant, though still feisty, character. She was computer generated and Geordi carried a crush for her. So she shows up and when Geordi starts putting moves on her, she is confused and somewhat hostile. She blames him for messing around with her engine (not her engine, the Enterprise engine). They have a volatile encounter and agree to try to make the best of things. Unfortunately for our visored hero, she comes upon his holodeck program and goes ballistic. He is angry and hurt but I have to tell you, he deserves every bit of it. At the very least, he should have destroyed the program. She was right to imagine him using her as a toy. There is something else going on while all this is playing out. The crew discovers a life form that looks a little bit like a giant ravioli with a tail. It is aggressive and Picard is forced to defend the ship using what he feels is a restrained blow. Unfortunately, he kills it. Picard is horrified at what he has done. This is a newly discovered life form and what he has done is unconscionable. Shortly thereafter, it is realized that the thing was pregnant and its aggressiveness was probably a motherly instinct. The baby is born but bonds with the Enterprise, drawing energy from the ship and putting it in grave danger. Picard, already considering himself a murderer, feels he must not use life threatening action against the little one. It is up to Brahms and LaForge to come up with something. Pretty decent offering.",7
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Galaxy's Child (TV Episode 1991)",La Forge has issues,"Here's a curious case of bringing back an obscure holodeck plot device (Dr. Leah Brahms, whose real self is even more attractive at maximum aloofness). All of the stuff about Geordi fantasizing about a hologram doesn't tend to make our Chief Engineer look well-adjusted (or his love life, but it all turns out alright in the end).The better material lies in the other plot line, with the Enterprise being attacked by an expectant space organism . . . and then performing a phaser C-section after the being's been killed. This really hit upon the space exploration angle of Star Trek, and I thought was pretty well done.7/10",7
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Galaxy's Child (TV Episode 1991)",Geordi is creepier than we thought!,In a previous adventure Enterprise's chief engineer Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge worked with a holographic representation of Dr Leah Brahms; the woman responsible for the design of the ship's engines and now the real Dr Brahms is visiting to discuss his various modifications he is more than a little excited; partly for professional reasons and partly because he has developed feelings for her holographic alter-ego! He is in for quite a shock as she isn't pleased with the fact that he has modified her work and seems to take an immediate dislike to him. Meanwhile the ship encounters a strange space-dwelling creature whose actions pose a threat to the ship; an attempt to stop it kills the creature which turns out to have been pregnant. Feeling responsible the crew save the baby which promptly attaches itself to the hull and drains power as if it was suckling on its mother. Attempting to save the baby and protect the ship they head to where the mother was going. With power being drained they must make more modifications and while doing this Dr Brahms discovers Geordi's holodeck program and is horrified to say the least.This episode is effectively two stories combined into one; the problem of dealing with the 'space-baby' and Geordi's relationship with the woman he idolised and clearly fancies. The former is typical Star Trek as the crew deal with a moral dilemma which also poses a threat. The second is more interesting and more disturbing; Geordi always came across as a likable character but here he comes across as distinctly creepy it is no wonder Dr Brahms is unimpressed by his sudden advances and then horrified by her portrayal on the holodeck. The strange thing is I think we were meant to feel sorry for Geordi rather than Dr Brahms and there are no consequences for his actions other than a little embarrassment! Guest star Susan Gibney does a solid job as Dr Brahms; I certainly believed her anger with Geordi was real! Overall a bit of an odd episode but entertaining none the less.,8
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Galaxy's Child (TV Episode 1991)",Maybe they should have changed the order of events,"""Mr. LaForge, I accuse you of violating me on the holodeck!""""I'm guilty of something much worse!""""Oh yeah? What?""""Being nice to you!""""I'm sorry. Can we be friends now?""..............what???In this episode we focus on Geordi and that's almost never a good idea. He hasn't had too much character development, and although he is a fine character in any scene with Data or with the bridge crew, he is slightly too 2D to pull of a character episode.SPOILERSPLOTHaving used Dr Brahms likeness on the holodeck in an earlier crisis (I will get to that review soon where I will focus on why the computer makes a warm, available and flirtatious creation where there is no need for one and that couldn't have been farther from the truth) Geordi is very excited about the real one turning up. He puts the moves on her but she is cold and hostile. Meanwhile the Enterprise heads straight for an unknown life form and when it defends itself from this menacingly advancing mechanical thing Picard immediately kills it, living in a world where a warning shot appears to be missing from procedures. It turns out the life form was pregnant and Crusher performs a C-section (don't worry, I'll address it). The baby life form sees its dead parent and this weird looking ship that is the only thing around, and instead of thinking ""Mayhaps that alien killed me mum, let's get out of here"" it declares the Enterprise its new mother (The mother is dead, long live the mother). It latches onto the ship and drains its energy, and the crew try to get it to a energy rich asteroid field where similar creatures appear. Meanwhile Brahms and LaForge duke it out but come to a sort of truce until she finds his holodeck fantasy and goes mental. However, she seems to forgive him after a heartfelt speech and they succeed in removing the baby, reuniting it with its kind.Things I liked and dislikedNormally I make two sections but there are two sides to many points. Another reviewer with the amusing pen name planktonrules wrote: ""I can EASILY imagine a woman macing a guy like this"", talking about LaForges inappropriate tone and behavior. He does come across as a creeper and that's highly unprofessional, but then again so is bitching against him and verbally castrating him as Dr Brahms does.I like the idea of a real person not living up to holodeck expectations but I dislike a person having them in the first place (expectations based on a fantasy I mean).I like the idea of the floating alien but the way Picard approaches it a conflict seems normal.The C-section is utterly ridiculous because the life form is unknown and Crusher has no idea what she's doing.Guinan is a relief as always, she seems like a much, much better counselor than Troi if I'm honest because she doesn't impose on people, tries to understand them rather than lecturing, and doesn't patrol the corridors of the ship looking for psychoprey.I like the idea of a asteroid field as a natural habitat but I hated how Data knew where to go ""based on the direction the life form was heading"" when we encounter it hanging still in space, in orbit around a planet, a planet they completely ignore.I loved Dr Brahms encountering the holodeck fantasy but I hated how LaForge got away with it but acting like he was hurt. The scene doesn't make any sense. He counters her understandable accusations of holodeck violation with a speech how she's mean to him while he tries to befriend her. Erm...yeah...but dude...the problem is the holodeck fantasy for which you have to answer, not deflect the guilt.In typical TNG fashion the episode ends on a utterly positive note. Geordi is friends with Dr Brahms, the alien is amongst others of its kind, the crew has rectified murdering a alien in labor, and no one really learns anything and nothing has consequences.CHANGING THE ORDER OF EVENTSI think the episode would have been a lot better if Dr Brahms turned out to be every bit as warm and nice in the beginning as she is at the end of the episode, then finds the holodeck fantasy after being creeped out by Geordi, then explode, THEN either not forgive him or achieve success and an uneasy truce. By introducing her as a cold and vile woman you instantly don't care Geordi groped a holocopy of her making her outrage uninteresting. If they had shown her to be nice and likable, then having her turned ugly, it would have made for a better episode.CONCLUSIONSome people hate it but that's unfair. I admit it brings together Starfleet doing unintentional harm/Geordi strikes out/let's end on a sweet note which often plague TNG seasons, but the episode has an interesting alien life form, some proper engineering work, and some good Picard moments. Part of the problem is Geordi not having enough depth as a character. Imagine O'Brien had worked closely with the holodeck Brahms and Keiko one day discovering this seductive holowoman. that would have made for good television.

0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Night Terrors (TV Episode 1991)",Night Terrors,"""It's a terrifying prospect, to lose control of one's mind."" The Enterprise has been pursuing a missing ship, the USS Brittain, finding it adrift, 34 of the crew dead, having murdered each other, only one survivor being a Betazed officer overcome with total fear. It seems that now the Enterprise crew has become trapped in a ""rupture in space"" where energy is absorbed, leaving the warp engines powerless. This is known as Tyken's Rift, named after a ship's captain who escaped from one. It seems that perhaps another group of lifeforms have been trapped as well, needing assistance from the Enterprise in order to be set free, communicating to Counselor Troi in a repeating loop when she ""sleeps"" (it is considered a nightmare to her and therefore sleeping regularly has become too difficult, although she, being Betazoid, has ""buffers"" that keep her from succumbing to paranoia, fear, and hallucinations) where she appears, floating in a greenish cloud, approaching its center as an ominous voice mentions, ""Eyes in the dark. One moon circles."" This could be a message, a plea for help and the answer to how to combat the rupture imprisoning the Enterprise in the area of space they find themselves. Meanwhile, the lifeforms in the vicinity of the Enterprise cause everyone on board to lose REM sleep because of their communications to Troi; in other words, in reaching out to Troi in her sleep, it deprives the others of their REM sleep.Fascinating story examines the importance of deep sleep and dreams, how without them insanity is assured and cognitive function deteriorates. This episode offers a first-hand look at the terrors that come when dreams are lost and REM sleep is kept from the crew. Riker hears strange sounds, has the feeling that he's being watched yet no one's there, and sees snakes at the foot of his bed. Picard has a terrible moment where he believes he's about to be crushed in the turbolift. Chief O'Brien becomes ridiculously jealous that his wife is spending too much time with a science officer. A Starfleet officer in Ten Forward is becoming paranoid that those in command plan to keep his fellow officers held inside a room against their will, with nefarious plans in store for them. But the ultimate spooky scene has Crusher in sickbay as the 34 dead Brittain crew are sit up in their body bags! Another awesome scene has Worf nearly committing a ritualistic Klingon suicide because he considers himself no longer a warrior thanks to fearthankfully Troi is there in time before he can complete the form of Hirikiri he was about to perform. Seeing the Enterprise crew losing control, weakening from lack of rest, unable to remember basic things that are the norm, is really quite intriguing. The results are predictable (you don't think the crew of the Enterprise will wind with the same fate as the Brittain, do you?), and Troi gets a chance to be heroine once again. Data as ""Acting Captain"" because he is an android, therefore not encumbered by the night terrors, is really cool, although it doesn't necessarily have the same awesome impact as, say, Geordi's command in ""The Arsenal of Freedom"".",7

Soon, everyone begins exhibiting paranoia with the exception of Troi who has nightmares and Data who is an android. Dr. Crusher soon realizes that the root cause has something to do with REM sleep (Rapid Eye Movement) - which is the level of brain activity in which one dreams. But that's not all that's going on.Can the Enterprise crew figure out what's happening before the same thing happens to them? Trivia note: Whoopi Goldberg stars again as Guinan.

The Enterprise crew then starts to exhibit the same problems that the other ship experienced. Humans appear to be not be able to have deep sleep (REM)anymore. Only Data, the android, and Deanna, the Betazoid, are immune to the loss of deep sleep. Deanna and Data become the only crew members who can work to find out how to get out of the situation. The scariest moment of the episode is when Doctor Crusher is working in a room with the dead victims from the other ship. With her lack of REM sleep, she hallucinates that all of the corpses all of sudden sit upright on the tables that they are laying on.",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Night Terrors (TV Episode 1991)","Slick, Cool, and Loads of Fun","Coming off the disappointing resolution of Clues, TNG bounces back with another mystery that has a much more satisfying conclusion. But I'll get to that (no spoilers in this review).It starts off with the Enterprise arriving on the scene of a derelict ship: the Brattain. The Brattain's engines have no power, and all its crew are dead (save one, who only has a single vital purpose for the plot) -- it turns out they killed each other. The Brattain's logs indicate an increase in paranoia and erratic behavior in the weeks leading up to everyone's demise. What happened?The lack of power to the engines is also a mystery. Geordi says everything should work, but nothing does. They decide to put the Brattain in tow, but then the Enterprise starts experiencing engine problems, as well.The crew also starts to have issues with aggressive behavior, hallucinations, memory loss, and the like. Even when Crusher discovers the cause, there isn't anything they can do about it. Meanwhile, Troi is having nightmares about floating through space and hearing voices. And as Picard realizes that he, too, is not immune, he confides in Data that he may be the one crew member that can keep them from ending up like the Brattain.All this sets up for a nice, tight resolution to the mystery, but there are also some neat little touches along the way. For example, as the days progress, Troi's hair looks more disheveled. Picard looks visibly older. Crusher fumbles in search of her communicator pin. They sell it. And we buy it.This is an all-around enjoyable episode. It's everything that's good about Star Trek, rolled up into a suspenseful hour-long episode. Easily one of the best of the season, if not the series.",8

The crew figures out that his means that they need to send hydrogen to the aliens, because they figure that one moon is one electron revolving around one proton. But if the aliens can send a message in English, and are sophisticated enough to use metaphors, why can't they just say, ""send hydrogen."" It makes no sense and the entire episode is base on it.",3
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Night Terrors (TV Episode 1991)",Plot is Very Creative; But How Did They Know to Do What They Did?,"A Starship is found floating in space. It is functioning for the most part but only one crew member is left alive. He is Betazoid but in a catatonic state. Records show that the crew had lapsed into fear and paranoia. They had actually killed each other. Now the proximity of the disabled ship begins to affect the Enterprise crew. People are unable to dream and this leads to the symptoms that finished off the previous crew. The Enterprise has one advantage: Commander Data. As is usually the case, he is not affected by forces that humans face. As order disintegrates, Deanna Troi is the only one having dreams, and she is having nightmares. She is floating into a void, heading for a light, while a voice speaks to her in what seems to be nonsense. I decided not to be too critical because I wanted to see things play out. For me, a weakness is that sometimes the solutions to problems in this series are so far-fetched, so sophisticated, or so complex, it blows my mind as to how even Data can come up with an answer on such short notice. Still, I think this is one of the most imaginative episodes of the series.",9
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Night Terrors (TV Episode 1991)",A real nightmare,This episode of TNG speaks of the possibility of lack of sleep causing all kinds of ill effects. I can tell you that a lack of REM sleep where you cannot dream can lead to all kinds of hallucinations. I remember getting on a Greyhound bus one time and I hadn't really been able to fall asleep. I remember going New York State's southern tier and passing one of the Finger Lakes I had a hallucination of black helicopters coming down on the lake. I can identify with what the Enterprise crew was going through.The Enterprise is heeding a distress call from the USS Brattain sent about 3 weeks ago and finds the ship with only one survivor a Betazoid like Counselor Troi. Everyone else is dead and it looks like the crew was the victim of a mass hysteria.Soon the Enterprise might go the same way as the ship is trapped in a space rift and the fatigue is telling on all the crew.The two key people in this crisis are Deanna Troi and Data the Android who takes over the command. Data is not affected at all and Troi is affected differently. Together they bring about the solution to their troubles.This episode really hit home.,7
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Night Terrors (TV Episode 1991)",To sleep perchance to dream,"The crew of the Enterprise find the USS Brittain adrift in space; all but one of its crew, a Betazoid, are dead. It soon becomes apparent that they killed each other; the captain's log showing they grew more and more paranoid over a period of three weeks until they turned on each other. The Enterprise prepares to tow the Brittain it loses engine power; they are working perfectly but it appears something is draining energy as soon as it is produced. They are caught in something known as a Tyken's Rift with no obvious means to escape. As time passes the crew start hallucinating and like the crew of the Brittain they start to become more paranoid. Dr Crusher has noticed something else; since they entered the rift the crew, with the exception of Counsellor Troi, have stopped dreaming and Troi is having recurring identical nightmares. If the Enterprise is to avoid the fate of the Brittain they will have to discover what Troi's dreams mean.This episode may lack novel aliens and dramatic action but that doesn't mean it is boring; the growing sense of paranoia and the crew's increasing concerns give the episode the feel of a well-made chiller. This works as the effects are gradual, almost unnoticeable but by the end everybody apart from Data is becoming distinctly fraught and struggling to hold onto their sanity. The cast do a fine job; Gates McFadden standing out particularly as Dr Crusher; there is a great scene where she sees the dead of the Brittain sit up in the makeshift morgue and some fine scenes between her and Patrick Stewart's Captain Picard. Overall a gripping episode.",9
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Night Terrors (TV Episode 1991)",Meh....,"This is another episode where the Enterprise is stuck in space and not a whole lot happens--no landing party to meet aliens or battles or anything that is that interesting. In a word, the show lacks ENERGY. The ship finds some other ship where everyone but one is dead (a familiar theme) and this time it appears as if they killed each other. Soon, folks on the Enterprise star acting goofy-- paranoid, having difficulty thinking or giving orders. Because of this, Data is placed in charge. The reason, it turns out, is that people are not experiencing REM sleep and something out there is disrupting this needed deep sleep. Soon, they'll all go mad unless they stop this, because in addition the ship is stuck and cannot move.So, the ship is stuck and everyone is slowly wasting away. Sounds exciting, no? NO! A pretty dull episode through and through will little to recommend it.",3

2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Identity Crisis (TV Episode 1991)",Awesome Visuals,"This is a great episode that is very memorable. The makeup for the ""creatures"" is just awesome, timeless. Even to this day 17 years later, I remembered all the key parts of this episode. There is one noticeable plot hole which I will save until the end.(Despite the negative things I am going to point out, this series is one of the best ever made. This is more for critical/trivia purposes) The scene with the shuttle though was kind of a let down in ILM's department. But since they weren't paid movie prices for these visuals they frequently seem to provide special effects that aren't 100% following the script. For example a few episodes before this when they are being sucked into the black hole the Enterprise was shown just on the precipice about ready to go in, and then they come back to the crew and they say they have 15 minutes until event horizon. Later the ship is shown much farther away than the first shot. Then they just up and fly away like nothing was ever wrong - not even a struggle to pull from the insane gravity. I don't know if this was editing or what, but these inconsistent visuals happen more than a little bit.But it's high time I pointed it out. I can't take it any more. Another person here on IMDb commented on the awesome uniforms and costumes in this episode but I beg to disagree. There is a condition related to Starfleet Uniforms(only for some reason) and it's a condition that has its own name.It's the Dreaded Starfleet Uniform Pull.They all do it. It's like their picking their nose and they don't want you to see it. The camera comes in close with a head and chest shot and out of the camera's range, the actor is doing the Dreaded Shirt Pull. In one particular scene in this episode Geordi is having a conversation with Data (time index 22:45-25:00ish) and every time he lifts his arms to gesture in his speech, or leans over to take the railings his uniform fails him and he does the Dreaded Shirt Pull 5-6 times (once off camera a close shot- but you can still tell).Could you imagine him really having to get work done in that suit, crawling thru Jeffries' Tubes and realigning warp coils, constantly battling his ever rising and bunching shirt? This is where there costume designers have completely failed them, despite doing such excellent work for the alien races. In fact having just watched DS9 in its entirety and seeing them go thru 3-4 different uniforms over the series and they still did the Deaded Shirt Pull. They may have looked like space douche bags in the beginning of the series, but at least when the uniforms were spandex they fit right and the Dreaded Shirt Pull was kept to a minimum.Other times, these revealing uniforms show a little too much actor if you know what I mean. Poor Deanna has had a camel toe or two in that jumpsuit, not to mention anything about the upper half. Certain actors may or may not have had man boobs at certain points in the show. They must have really had to try and maintain their figures to pull of those old suits. At one point in the beginning of season 4 I swear Data was wearing a girdle(which resulted in weird folds in his suit) because he came back from the off-season a little chunky. This is further evidenced by his additional android chins which fade as the season progresses. One last thing I will point out is that when they show footage of Geordi 5 years ago they did remember to bust out the old red spandex suit but they didn't put on his old gold banana clip visor which you can spot from a mile away. I think he's actually on his third visor by now and it has vastly improved his believability as a character. It's hard to take one seriously when they are looking at you thru a $2 banana clip wearing a Red Spandex Onesy. Oh well, at least they tried to keep it accurate. Levar Burton probably lit the thing on fire and smashed it into a thousand pieces when they finally invested the money in his character and gave him a new visor. So maybe that's why he couldn't wear it in the historical footage.The plot hole is that when Geordi turns into the ""creature"" they find his uniform. What about those blinking lights on the side of his head, did those just fall away as he transformed? But yet they weren't discovered with his shredded uniform. He didn't sport them as the ""creature"". Meanwhile he is fully capable of sight without his visor as this new creature in less than a few hours? If they did come off are we to believe doctor crusher put his visor implants back on real quick (she's less than technical minded-leaving Data's medical care to Geordi). It's a plot hole that could have been easily worked around by making him wear the visor as the ""creature"". Even though Beverly explained that the parasite can happen fast or slow, it just all seemed a little TOO fast for Geordi. Another thing is, he seemed to have retained memories of his existence as this ""creature"" so why isn't he a little more excited about having seen with his own eyes without a visor for the first time?",9

Will they, too, experience a similar fate?My favourite scene is Geordi on the holodeck, desperately trying to 'find the clue in the picture'. If you are a film nerd like me, you will immediately think of the long, fascinating scene in the film Blow Up, when the main character painstakingly analyses a photo he took to try and solve a murder.

Susanna starts behaving oddly and is brought back to the Enterprise however she feels a compulsion to return to the planet and it is noticed that her body is changing at a genetic level. Geordi is determined to discover what is happening so he can save his friend but it could be too late for him.This enjoyably episode sees LeVar Burton take the lead as Geordi La Forge along with guest star Maryann Plunkett who played Susanna; both put in solid performances in a story that includes a good mystery there is no obvious danger but clearly something is effected those who took part in the away mission five years ago. The special effects and makeup used as Susanna and Geordi start to transform is impressive.

Soon, he begins to show amazing intellectual prowess. Additionally, his confidence now seems to know no bounds. At first, all this is great and he becomes a much more valuable member of the crew. But, when he's assuming almost god-like abilities, it scares the crap out of everyone. And, by this point, can anyone stop him?!Apart from how incredibly stupid the crew was in this one (it took WAY too long for anyone to suggest that contact with the probe is what changed Barkley), this is a great episode. I'd like to say more, as the way all this works is wonderful, but I don't want to spoil it. Enjoyable, a bit funny but also very clever.",9

2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Nth Degree (TV Episode 1991)",Excellent Story from The Great Bird of the Galaxy,"While watching this episode recently, it occurred to me that it bore a strong resemblance to the second pilot of TOS, ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"". In that episode, Lt. Cmdr. Gary Mitchell, the first to hold the navigator chair, obtains increasingly more powerful abilities, i.e., telekinesis, telepathy, etc. Those new powers corrupt the all-around-good-guy Mitchell, a colleague of Kirk's from a prior ship assignment they both shared. He eventually has to be destroyed in order to save the ship, if not the Federation.ST:TNG ""The Nth Degree"" has a similar premise yet very different build up. The very flawed Barklay, alternately to Mitchell, who is well-adjusted in the extreme, uses his powers for the good of the ship and the Federation. His actions automatically assume one of greater good, opposite Mitchell's ego driven actions.So it's rather comforting to know that both were penned by Gene Roddenberry, the creator of the franchise, and how, just before his death, he had gained a little more hope for the species than he had at the first series' birth.",9

As time passes his intelligence increases exponentially; he solves problems in ways others wouldn't even consider and ultimately, frustrated by the slowness of the Enterprise's computer he creates a neural interface; effectively making him one with the computer. While this is going on the senior crew are unsure what to do about Reg; his changes are helpful at the moment but how long will it be until he is so much more intelligent that they no longer concern him?This enjoyable episode sees a welcome return for Dwight Schultz as occasional character Reg Barclay; he does a fine job depicting Reg's change from a highly introvert character to one who is both supremely confident and incredibly intelligent. The nature of this change means we don't know whether he is becoming a threat or will prove benevolent. The ultimate answer fits in well with the series overall ethos that not every unexplained event is the act of malevolent forces. The rest of the cast perform well as one would expect.

If the arrival wasn't enough another face from his past returns; this time somebody everybody on the Enterprise knows: Q! Q claims that he is there to repay a debt he owes to Picard and he will repay it whether Picard wants him to or not. Q has a strange idea of repaying a debt; he transforms Picard and his senior staff into Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men before taking them to a recreation of Medieval England. Here he informs Picard that Vash is playing the role of Maid Marian and if he doesn't rescue her by noon the next day she will be executed.This is a fun if somewhat silly episode much like the character of Q; his omnipotence makes him too powerful. Thankfully John de Lancie's performance makes this potentially disastrous character quite fun. Jennifer Hetrick puts in a spirited performance as Vash her turn as 'Maid Marian' was a delight as she clearly had her own ideas about how to stay alive. The whole Robin Hood thing was somewhat cheesy but again it provided a few decent laughs; Worf's 'I am not a Merry Man' comment was priceless as was the moment he destroyed Geordi's lute.

Jean-Luc Picard is so disciplined and reserved; and, Vash is Picard's exact opposite. It was great seeing Vash return to the show.The appearance of Q in this episode was not surprising. Most of the ""Star Trek: the Next Generation"" episodes in which Q appeared included a reference to Q in the episodes' titles. Q was a great foil for the Enterprise crew; and by this point in the series, Q was a humorous character as well.

There was one scene which borrowed a joke from the movie, ""Animal House"" (I won't say what the joke was; but, it worked well in this episode as both a reference to the scene in ""Animal House"" as well as a joke in its own right).Overall, the episode was light-hearted fun and was very enjoyable to watch!",9

Picard's love interest (or as close as you'll find to one) Vash appears unexpectedly for the conference. Considering she's an amoral thief, it is very odd (and makes no sense) that Picard allows her unrestricted access to the ship. In the midst of this little reunion, Q appears and demands that Picard allow him to repay his debt from the last episode. Of course, the fun-hating Picard refuses strongly, so Q decides to do something for him anyways, transporting Picard and the series regulars into an adventure that looks like it's straight from the holodeck--involving Picard playing Robin Hood. On hand as Maid Marion is Vash and the whole thing is amazingly silly, though it seems Q set all this up in order to give Picard a chance to impress his girl.There are some funny and wonderful moments--such as when Troi is trying out a bow and arrow as well as the way Vash and Q hit is off together.

Usually, the instant mentioning of Q suggests a silly or at lest fanciful episode. But this just hangs their like wet laundry. It had no spring, no verve; and more than that, it felt like a waste of both Q's charm and the continuation of a Picard romance that has no future.

Like so many other TNG episodes, the writers seemed to want to squeeze too much into the 45-minute time-slot and then they'd have to rush the ending.What surprised me most were countless lines of dialog that have a very eerie quality with regards to our current political climate and especially the shift in politics in the US since 9/11.

However Satie's Betazoid assistant with her mind reading capability insists Tarses is hiding something. The inquisition resumes in an open courtroom where the proceedings had been private before and Tarses pleads the 5th Amendment to inquiries that he is 1/4 Romulan instead of Vulcanian and lied on his Starfleet Admission form, making his testimony ""suspect.""

This being the reason for the investigation. Picard tries to dissuade Satie from continuing the investigation but she flatly refuses indicating that she reports directly to Starfleet Command. Meanwhile Picard is now grilled by Satie and his career is put into question with Prime Directive violations, his Borg assimilation and Satie questions Picard's loyalty to Starfleet. When Lt. Cdr.

When Picard's response is to quote Satie's father, a respected jurist, on the subject of the state placing limitations on a person's liberty. Satie furiously berates Picard for invoking her father's name in his own defense, stating that she has ""brought down bigger men than you, Picard!"" Admiral Henry leaves the room in the middle of the tirade, having recognized Satie's paranoia for what it was. The prosecution calls a recess, and leaves a disgraced Satie sitting alone in the courtroom.The episode ends with Worf finding Picard in the observation lounge to inform the captain that Admiral Henry has ended the hearings and of Satie's departure from the Enterprise. Picard remarks that the human race thinks it has come so far, with the Inquisition and the Salem Witch Trials all an unpleasant memory. Worf laments that he was initially eager to assist Satie in her witch-hunt because of how she presented her case. Picard speaks of the ever-present, but subtle, danger of those who would spread fear and suspicion in the name of righteousness and reminds him that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance.Satie's breakdown at the end is reminiscent of Capt.

7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Drumhead (TV Episode 1991)",Good episode with a surprise nuisance and some serious problems with Starfleet Justice,"THE PLOT (SPOILERS)Suspecting espionage and sabotage Starfleet sends an retired admiral/prosecutor to investigate. Picard co-operates until he begins to suspect a witch hunt and starts to resist. This shifts the focus of investigation to Picard himself and he must answer charges. Exploiting the admiral's instability, Picard drives home a moral lesson.THE GOOD STUFFPicard is wonderful in this and for the most part so is the admiral. Ensign Tarses is interesting too, and I like he lied about his Romulan ancestor which shows how deep racism and prejudice still lurk in the depths of the supposed highly rational Federation. This episode also raises serious questions about the justice at work in Starfleet, of which Picard usually boast as a great virtue. The fact that it seems biased and hostile, and thus flawed, makes it more believable. I cheered Worf on as he was about to destroy a prosecutor bringing up his father's supposed dishonor.THE BAD STUFF1) Worf. It feels weird writing this as he is usually one one of the better characters, but here I disliked him. I'm so sick and tired of people saying ""yeah but he is Klingon"" (other characters, reviewers and fans alike). Come on, he was raised by humans, grew up amongst humans, went to school with them and serves with them. He's not really Klingon and this explains why every single Klingon he encounters takes the mickey out of him. In Redemption he shows a constant lack of understanding of Klingon culture.But here, when the chance presents itself to ruin a fellow officer he becomes all Klingon, immediately assuming guilt when someone doesn't answer, and participating almost gleefully in the witch hunt. Has he forgotten all the Federation supposedly stands for? Every lesson he learned from Picard. In fact, only when the Admiral accuses Picard does he become offended. He annoyed me in this one.2) I fail to see how the Admiral's rant at the end changes anything. She basically says out loud what everyone already knows, that she accuses Picard of being a collaborator. Her anger at him twisting her beloved and dearly missed father's words seems normal to me. 3) This is the worst example of Starfleet justice after Measure of a Man. Yes, yes, that's a fine episode but the justice part is ridiculous. In Measure of a Man, the starbase doesn't have legal personnel so unqualified officers will do, the judge is Picard's old flame, Riker is forced to participate under direct threat of Data's life, he doesn't get a closing statement but the Judge does allow him to dismantle the defendant, and to top it all of, Picard immediately offers her dinner the second she rules in his favor. A TOTAL FARCE! This episode is almost as bad. Unqualified people interrogate until the professionals arrive, the admiral is clearly bonkers, a crewman is only suspect because of uninformed and illegal Betazoid probing of the mind, one of the Federation's Guarantees (cough Fifth Amendment cough) is used as a slap in the face of someone exercising that right, no one bothers to supervise a deluded Klingon from digging a fellow officer's past and so on and so on. It makes Starfleet's hatred of Cardassian justice extremely shallow and hypocrite.4) There are better episodes to vent my hatred of the Prime Directive but the fact that Picard, one of the best captains in the fleet, is accused of violating it so many times, proves, to me, the utter invalidity of the PD in the first place. captains cannot help violating it because it is not realistic, not practical, not usable in unforeseen circumstances.5) The instant Worf approves of the Admirals'tactics she proclaims her faith that he will turn out to be very important in the investigation. A little conceited, isn't it?CONCLUSIONOver all I like this episode but it enhanced my problems with admirals (they only make things worse), Betazoids (probing people without their permission should be against the law), Federation justice (it's biased, hostile, illegal almost), and the moral compass of the Chief of Security. I like the tense, almost paranoid feel of this episode, but since it is clear Picard will never be convicted the trial does lose some of its initial appeal. Worf is insufferable and his turnabout does not come from a sincere realization but from his crush on Picard. This episode raises some serious questions about the often repeated superiority of human and Federation justice (Picard often mentions ""a fair trial"" but I have yet to see one). It is a good one though, and certainly worthy of your time. 7/10",7

Simmons who gives a great performance a visiting admiral from what I guess
is the equivalent of the Judge Advocate's office of Star Fleet.She's brought an assignment and a pair of aides to possibly uncover treason
aboard the Enterprise. They do in fact uncover a Klingon spy and that whets
Simmons's appetite for more. The focus is on a medical technician played by Spencer Garrett who is instead of one quarter Vulcan is in fact one quarter Romulan. Bloodlines
however do not make for treason. Additionally an explosion in engineering
is found to be accidental.To Simmons's Joe McCarthy is Bruce French's Betazoid Roy Cohn. Just like Joe McCarthy, Simmons and French make innuendo and suspicion to paranoia a fine art.It's a sad commentary that even four or five centuries later we still have Joe
McCarthys and Donald Trumps ready to play on our insecurities. The bright
side is we have Jean-Luc Picards ready to fight the good fight for decency.",9
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Drumhead (TV Episode 1991)",A witch hunt aboard the Enterprise,"An explosion in the Enterprise's engine room is linked to the leaking of confidential documents to the Romulans so retired admiral Nora Satie is brought in to investigate. The prime suspect is a Klingon exchange officer and it is soon shown that he leaked the documents but he denies any connection to the explosion. As the investigation expands suspicion falls on a young medical officer as Satie's Betazoid assistant senses that he is hiding something important during his interview. That something turns out to be the fact that one of his grandparents was Romulan rather than Vulcan as he claimed on his Star Fleet application. Picard doesn't see this as evidence that he is involved in a conspiracy; in fact by now it has been established that the explosion was due to a faulty part rather than enemy action however these are just details to Satie who is determined to uncover 'the conspiracy' and sees anybody who defends those she accuses as a co-conspirator. Picard sees this as a witch-hunt and tries to call off the enquiry; this only puts him in the firing line as Satie starts going through his record.It is said ""Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness"" but those who absolutely believe in the righteousness of their cause can be just as dangerous as ones enemies and ""The road to Hell is paved with good intentions'. Initially Satie come across as an upstanding advocate for justice but gradually it becomes apparent that she is a zealot; Jean Simmons does a fine job in the role as she gradually reveals just how obsessed she is. Patrick Stewart is on top form as Capt. Picard as he fights for the ideals the Federation was built on. The story might not be full of action but it is dramatic with an important message to put across and we can't forget that there are still plenty of people willing to justify the use of dubious techniques to expose suspected foes in the name of what is 'right'.",9

It certainly is my favorite episode that isn't regularly mentioned as a top 5 episode, such as The Inner light, or the good Borg, Q or Time Travel episodes.The drumhead has the type of villain which really gets under my skin more than others due to the type's continued effectiveness and presence throughout history.This episode's villain is so camouflaged that she uses one of the typically good characters, in Worf, as an ally in her corruption. And Worf follows along willingly, only seeing his errors at the end of the episode.It's a phenomenon we can find often in people who get so swept up in an opportunity to create order and justice of some sort, that they end up resembling the very type of evil they're trying to fight due to their own tribal arrogance and exaggerated fear of the other. Often such villains gain power and test the norms slowly one step at a time until before many realize it, there's a completely new evil norm out of a promise for a miracle cure to a problem where a solution hasn't been demonstrated as much as asserted as a problem.And just like Worf, the individuals who seem to get swept up in such mistaken causes are typically the people who seem unable to spot irony, hypocrisy or enjoy a joke or construct a joke because they're so serious and desperate for vengeance. Their good qualities get obscured by their lesser illogical desires to get their way in solving some issue regardless of the costs.",10

However, on the other hand, the show is VERY obvious and familiar.When the show begins, you learn that there has been sabotage aboard the Enterprise. Some Klingon exchange officer has deliberately damaged the engines to serve his Romulan overlords. It's not surprising that the Federation would send a big-wig to investigate, but Admiral Satie (Jean Simmons--the actress, not the guy from KISS) turns out to be an evil slug who is more interested in conducting a witch hunt than learning the truth. Considering all the similar situations we've experienced over the years (not just the Red Scare but more recent events as well), this is a good message.

Sure, it is written by modern-day authors ... even so, it's informative to see how a more ""enlightened"" generation might handle a topic like euthanasia.Incidentally, this concept is based loosely on a novel written in the 1880s by British novelist Anthony Trollope called THE FIXED PERIOD. In that novel, the leader of a new (fictional) British colony has passed a law requiring men at the age of 67 be put away into a tenement, and later euthanized before the age of 68 - for the same reasons, that the elderly burden the young.

Lwaxana implores him to ignore this unwritten law and live out his final years with her. He expects to kill himself, but soon realizes that if he dies, his important work which might save his planet might be set back significantly.I appreciate this episode about euthanasia, as it is timely and talks about human value.

Horrified she tries to persuade him to seek asylum but this offends both the authorities on his planet and his family.This is very much an 'issue of the week' episode where an alien culture seems offensive to outside eyes. Timicin explains the reasoning behind the practice and clearly believes that it is good as it avoids the old being a burden on the young even if many, if not most, people will still be productive members of society. A theme that is more topical now than when it was made as those against legalising assisted dying argue it is a stepping stone to people being expected to die if they are becoming a burden. David Ogden Stiers does a fine job as Timcin and Majel Barrett is good as Lwaxana; although I'm sure many will find the character annoying; she is certainly a force of nature but at least this time she has more emotional depth! Michelle Forbes, who later returns as Ensign Ro Laren, is great in her one, emotional, scene as Timcin's daughter where she pleads with her father to go through with the ritual.

Cmdr. Dax). It is with this body that Dr. Crusher falls in love with, in the form of Ambassador Odan, and only when he is injured does she discover the true Odan (the SYMBIONT)! When the host dies though, and the symbiont goes into Riker's body, Crusher faces a dilemma - who is it she truly loves? This will become even more apparent when Odan enters his new Trill host. An intriguing episode indeed.Trivia note: Nurse Ogawa makes another appearance. And, we see the ship's hair and manicure salon!",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Host (TV Episode 1991)",Introducing the Trill,"This episode sees the Enterprise transporting Ambassador Odan, a Trill, to mediate in a conflict that may escalate into a war. En route he and Dr Crusher have developed a relationship and now they are completely besotted. There is however something she doesn't know about the Trill; they are binary beings consisting of a symbiont and a host and the personality is contained in the slug-like symbiont not the man she sees before her. This wouldn't be a problem but an attack leaves the host dying leaving the 'real' Odan in need of a new host. They are far from the Trill homeworld so Will Riker volunteers to act as host during the peace conference while they await the new Trill host. This makes things very difficult for Beverly as it means her lover now looks like her old friend Will Riker; something she understandably has problems dealing with. Riker's body starts to reject the symbiont but the new host arrives just in time this doesn't make things easier for Dr Crusher though; the new host is a woman!Initially it looked as if the main theme of this episode would be the conflict that Odan was trying to solve but ultimately that proved a minor part of the story; the real story was all about the nature of the Trill and whether a person's appearance is as important as their personality when it comes to love not in the sense that appearances change with age or through accident but that in this case the person looks totally different. It was nice to see Beverly in love; Gates McFadden did a fine job did a fine job portraying both the infatuation then the confusion as Odan changed during the course of the episode. The Trill were a fascinating new species to add to the 'Star Trek' universe but anybody familiar with them from the later series 'Deep Space Nine' will be rather surprised as the details shown here contradict several things we see in that series; most notably the Trill look different and in this story they can't teleport due to their binary nature. Still over all this is a solid enough episode with some interesting ideas.",7

She is quite conflicted. Of course, none of us are able to recount our experiences with aliens, unless you live in a New Mexico desert, but our physical being is certainly a huge factor in our attractions and rejections. Let's face it, Heidi Klum is going to be more successful in attracting men than one of ordinary physical presence. And so it goes. If the guy had been transplanted into a duck, would Beverly have been attracted to him? Riker becomes the host. How about all the implications and hesitancies that are fueled by this reality. What if Wesley Crusher had been the host. How would she have handled that. There is so much unfairness here. There is even a touch of homophobia. Interesting episode.",7
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Host (TV Episode 1991)",The Host vs. DS9,"This episode is decent. The following nitpicks are directed at Star Trek continuity in general. Here are the differences I counted between the Trill in this episode and every single episode of Deep Space Nine:1: Spots/ ridges - (Obviously) in this episode the Trill have ridges on their foreheads instead of their trademark spots, apparently because Terry Farrell was allergic to the prosthetics.2: Transporter - In this episode Ambassador Odan said he couldn't use the transporter or he would ""die"". This is of course contradicted hundreds of times by DS9, every time Dax beams anywhere. Obviously this would have been a major hump to get over in writing DS9 episodes, so they hoped that everyone forgot about it.3: Federation knowledge of the Trill - The Federation in ""The Host"" doesn't know anything about the Trill at all, yet Curzon Dax was a Federation Ambassador during the Khitomer Accords and Torias Dax (2 hosts back) was revealed to be a star fleet officer. Don't know why they had to change this one. Dax could have been the first Trill in Starfleet and it wouldn't have made much of an impact on the show. 4: Symbiont and host relationship - In the TNG episode, the symbiont, Odan, completely retains his personality when joined with each host (Riker's personality, for instance, is totally buried under Odan's, hence: his having no problem becoming romantically involved with Crusher). It is spelled out numerous times in DS9 that the host and symbiont meld personalities to create one. Again, why change this? I guess it was more interesting to have previous hosts with problems etc5: Humans joining with the symbiont (TNG)/ host dies after symbiont is removed (DS9) - This is contradicted by the existence of Ezri Dax. She explains that she was the only trill on board (whatever ship it was) and that's why she wasn't properly prepared for the joining. But, if they followed the TNG episode's rule, it would have been no problem to use her as a carrier and then transport the Dax symbiont into someone more worthy when the opportunity arose. Was this writer's forgetfulness or laziness? 6: Taboo of rekindling past host's love affair absent - Every host Odan shows to inhabit in this episode wants little more than to get back with Doctor Beverly. This is of course contradicted by the DS9 episode ""Rejoined"", in which exile is the price for letting your past catch up with you. Though I suppose seeing Terry Farrell kiss Susanna Thomson was worth a complete disregard for continuity (sarcasm). It should be noted, I guess, that Odan could have been some kind of rebel, or his love of Dr. Crusher was so strong that he couldn't help himself, but I think that this episode's message (love the person underneath, etc) would have actually been strengthened by the inclusion of this taboo. So in conclusion: the writers invented it for ""Rejoined"" ignoring ""The Host"" completely. 7: Symbiont Dies (TNG) if not joined almost immediately - This is of course contradicted by the episode ""Equilibrium"" in which we see several symbionts ""taking a swim"" in the caves on the Trill home world. (side note: despite what an earlier reviewer stated, it is a different prop.)All this could have been avoided by DS9 by simply calling the race something else. It could have easily been another joined species. There are, after all, at least three shape shifting species (Metamorph, Comaloid, and of course, the Founders)",7
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Host (TV Episode 1991)",Dr. Crusher considers polygamy.,"When Star Trek fans see this episode today, the mystery isn't so mysterious. After all, one of the cast of ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" was supposed to be of the Trill--so the notion of having a body as a host and a sentient separate being inside isn't surprising. Back when ""The Host"" debuted, however, this was all new and probably surprised more than a few of the fans. That's because Dr. Crusher has fallen in love with Ambassador Odan and doesn't realize that as a Trill he also has one of these beings living inside. Now this isn't a case of ""Invasion of the Body Snatcher""--the relationship is voluntary and both sides benefit from this relationship. However, Dr. Crusher isn't prepared for this and only learns about this bonding when Odan is injured and his host body dies! In a pinch, to keep him alive, the thing known as 'Odan' temporarily is hosted by Riker--an awkward situation for the Doctor, to say the least! How does all this play out---well, see the show to find out for yourself.This was a great introduction to the Trill and made for a very interesting episode. It also offers some interesting bisexual subtext--something which might surprise some viewers. Well done overall.",7
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Host (TV Episode 1991)",Introduction to Dax,"This is the first time we are introduced to the sybiotic lifeform known as the Trill. The Trill in this episode are devoid of their signature spots and instead have some weird klingon-like (but caucasian) cranial crest. Although this was really more of an introduction to the topic of Trills, what they are, and how they love, ""The Host"" ends up being a major storyline later in ST DS9. In this episode Dr. Beverly Crusher falls in love with one slug over three bodies. This whole story line is salvaged and reworked later into a major running plot on DS9. Commander Worf falls in love with Jadzia Dax only to spurn Ezri Dax later when Jadzia dies.

But to explore these questions, you're going to have to watch an hour-long cheese-fest between Crusher and the Trill-controlled Riker, both of whom are bewildered and angst-ridden in the throes of interspecies love. Consider yourself warned.On the upside, we get to see a funny exchange between Crusher and Troi (and in the ship's salon, to boot). Personally, I experience great relief when I watch a worthwhile scene with Troi. My blood pressure normally spikes whenever she comes on screen, but it returns to an almost safe level when she proves not to be The Most Useless Individual Ever. Predictably, she returns to her normal annoying self post-haste. It doesn't take long for her to start badgering the doctor about her feelings. Crusher, weakened in her distraught emotional state, encourages this behavior. We must forgive her lapse.The real highlight of this episode is at the end when Crusher sees who her lover's new host is. Apparently, she doesn't swing that way....So, was this episode really just an inquiry on the nature of love? Or was it actually a covert attempt to romantically involve Riker with every female character in the entire series, no matter what the cost? The choice is yours!",

who Gates McFadden has fallen for. Luz is an ambassador sent to mediate a
conflict between two warring moons. But Luz is dying and during an attack he's
mortally injured.The Trill as we know is human host and a parasite living in symbiotic relationship.
The humanoid Luz dies and Dr. Crusher saves the parasite. To save the conference Jonathan Frakes acts as a temporary host. With that Commander
Riker has his health issues while all this is going on with the peace conference
proceeding as scheduled.This was a good story in that it had Frakes because of his situation acting out of character a bit from Riker.. McFadden also does well as a woman in love, but as the best surgeon around having to do operations she's not had experience with.We'd see more of Trills with the introduction of Jadzia Dax in Deep Space Nine

Most problematic is the implication that the host body becomes a mindless vehicle once the symbiont takes over. Even with the potential difficulty of shoehorning a more detailed explanation into an already busy episode, you'd think that Riker would ask some questions before volunteering so readily to have an alien parasite implanted in his abdomen.Franc Luz is believable as Odan #1, portraying the right mix of charm and trustworthiness capable of evoking strong romantic feelings in such a short time. In contrast, Jonathan Frakes' Odan #2 is basically a mellower Riker, and his scenes with Crusher fall flat. Odan #3 is Nicole Orth-Pallavicini, whose performance contains hardly a sliver of Luz's charisma. The episode's main idea is straightforward and needs no further comment. It's not the most compelling TNG story, but certainly far from the worst.",5

They also send an impostor to Risa and implant false memories so when Geordi returns to the Enterprise he has no idea that he did anything other than what he had planned while away.The Enterprise is undertaking a mission to help negotiate a peace between the Klingons and a breakaway colony; this isn't helped by an allegation that the Federation has been supplying weapons to the colony. When Geordi teleports a crate of weapons to the rebels that only strengthens the Klingons' worries. He however has no memories of what he did and leads the investigation this isn't the Romulans' final plan for Geordi though.In the opening moments of this episode I feared we were going to be getting a light hearted story set on Risa but thankfully the Romulans turned up and made things far more interesting. While we don't see the unpleasant images that are being projected into Geordi's mine his reaction is such that we don't need to see them; LeVar Burton does a fine job portraying Geordi in these scenes.

That's because if you've seen ANY iteration of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" or read the original novel, then you already know the entire story. Coming so soon after ""The Drumhead,"" which itself blatantly refers back to the era that produced ""The Manchurian Candidate"" in the first place (Sen. McCarthy => Sen. Iselin in the original ""TMC"" => Admiral Whatshername in ""Drumhead""), you have to wonder if the well had run dry in the ST:TNG writer's room after the glories of the first half of season 4. Whatever the case, I'm amazed that Richard Condon was not listed as a co-author of this episode, or at least got a ""based on a story by"" credit. The only saving grace is the tweaks to ""Candidate"" that they made to fit it into the Star Trek universe, as those adjustments set the stage for much Klingon drama to come. The fact that the actors are settled into their characters by this point also helps as the performances are pretty good throughout. Disappointing on its own, but it has an important place in one of the TNG story arcs.ADDITIONAL COMMENT: I've read elsewhere now that the writers intended this episode to be a homage to ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and even tried to get at least one of the actors from the original movie to do a cameo. I suppose I could forgive the lack of originality since this makes it clear the writers deliberately sought to use ""Candidate"" here. However, watching this episode cold as I did 20 years ago, and rewatching it again the other day before I discovered this little tidbit, all that strikes me is that while the adaptations to the Star Trek universe may have been clever, to me they still don't speak well about whatever creative juices were flowing or not at the time.

He gets great advice from Guinan and Riker.When watching Data interact with the O'Briens in 10 forward, we see that even though he cannot participate in humor internally, he is finally able to understand how to make a joke and make it funny, even though he himself doesn't understand the joke or can actually laugh at it. That's what makes him the most humorous member of the crew, because what for for him is an innocent question can come off with hilarious results because of the way he asks it.But this situation is a little bit more complicated than merely figuring out what humor is, this is in fact Data's first girlfriend, not counting his interaction with Tasha in season one.In the meantime the ship is exploring a very interesting looking dark matter nebula. This provides the backdrop for Data's exploration of sex and relationships.The two subjects counterbalance themselves in this episode. While Data's meanderings give us the humor, there is actual danger for the Enterprise that is not initially seen. Some bad things have to happen before they actually understand the level of danger they are in.The two issues are resolved, not too well for Mr. Data. In theory, my theory: Data should not have created a subprogram to govern his relationship, he actually was doing fine without it. This is just another example of how Data's interpersonal experimentations fail with hilarious results, hilarious for us, Data of course has no feelings.This is what he always says, but after Jenna leaves him, and he deletes the program, we are left with an image of Data picking up his cat Spot and holding it. That image says a lot. That although Data does not have feelings in the way humans have feelings, he does have some Positronic version of affection. He loves his cat, we know he loves his cat.

Inevitably his attempts to do things properly lead to him behaving out of character with Lt.

Having established what is causing the problem they decide to leave to nebula as quickly as safely possible; it won't be easy though and a shuttle will have to guide the ship back; a shuttle Picard insists on piloting.This was a slightly disappointing episode even though it was some good moments; largely provided by Data's accidental humour. Brent Spider is great in the role and he is ably supported by Michele Scarabelli who plays Lt. D'Sora however it is a pity that his relationship had to be with a one off character; we learn that Data spends a lot of time working with her but we've not seen, or even heard of, her before! The way Data tries to 'do things right' are mostly amusing although his attempt to have a lovers tiff proves more disturbing that amusing; both for the viewers and D'Sora. The secondary story concerning the nebula in introduced nicely in a gradual way but escalates to give one of the series more disturbing deaths a crew member walks off down a corridor, we hear her scream then see her dead; only her upper body above the floor; it is as though she has been eaten by the ship!

Fortunately, the second half is as strong as the first, making this, in my opinion, the very best of the cliff- hanger two-part episodes. Yes, even better than The Best Of Both Worlds.My only complaint is that much of the spoken Klingon is gibberish. Yes, ""naDev ghoS"" is correct for ""come here!"" And ""Gowron, Dajon, Dajon!"" makes good sense: Gowron, you have captured it, you have captured it.

However, despite his legitimacy to the title and his opponent being brutally killed by Worf in a previous episode, there is a schism that might just plunge the empire into war. The new opposition is led by two beastly sisters and their pipsqueak pretender to the throne. Can this schism also offer an opportunity for Worf to regain his honor? And, what part do the Romulans have in all this? As for Picard, he sure thinks they're behind all this and he's in the unenviable position of having to choose the next Klingon leader.This episode features betrayals, civil war, intrigues and death-- exactly what the show generally avoids but which many folks like me love! And, because it's such an exciting episode, it's no surprise that they'd make it the first of a two-part series that ends season 4 and begins season 5. Well worth seeing and exciting throughout.You might ask why did I only give this one an 8. After all, I love Klingon episodes. Well, the last 2 minutes of the show are BAD-- reintroducing a dead character which simply seems contrived and a bit stupid. Too bad...up until then, it was fantastic.",8

Picard is due to act as arbitrator at Gowron's appointment as Head of the High Council. It was meant to be a simple job as Gowron is clearly the rightful leader; however he is challenged for the position by a boy claiming to be the son of Duras. Duras may have been a traitor but his son, and more importantly his sisters who wish to be the power behind the throne, have the support of a significant number of senior Klingons. Picard will have a difficult job if he is to avert a civil war; a war that could lead to an alliance between the Klingon's and the Romulans if the Duras faction is victorious. All this gives Worf an opportunity to restore his family's honour as he decides to fight alongside Gowron.This is a top quality episode that gives a great cliff-hanger ending to the fourth season that sets things up nicely for the fifth season. It also serves to introduce Lursa and B'Etor, the Duras Sisters; two delightfully unpleasant characters whose cunning is almost feline. It also serves to introduce a Romulan officer who looks distinctly like the late Tasha Yar! Many episodes of 'Star Trek: TNG' are all about various issues and lack any real action; that is not the case here though there is plenty of action including impressive space battles. That isn't to say there are no character issues; Worf must decide whether his future lies with Star Fleet or with the Klingon Empire and Picard must make a decision on which the future of the Alpha Quadrant could depend.

As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 04This fourth act of the series lives up to the expectations on terms of bringing out new vivid concepts that are mostly pulled out from the old buried lands, what it unfortunately lacks is the thought provoking ethical dilemmas that were present in the previous season.Redemption Part 01The same old theme of meddling in or asked to, between an ongoing civil war but this time the stakes are high as it grows more personal and also the makers had to live up to the knockout of the finale of the season with a nail biting dramatic climax or one would think.",

Dr. Crusher even questions her being onboard because she mentions that Wesley is the only Starfleet officer ""with his mother onboard"".This episode has great use of music and great visual effects (especially at the beginning of the film when the Enterprise begins failing for some reason) while they try to launch a probe to study the rare explosion of a star in the Kavis Alpha Sector. Also, nice writing with the ""egg"" motif that runs though this episode.Watch this ""Evolution"", it's a great one!Trivia note: it's noted that a starship hasn't had a systemwide failure of the main computer in 79 years. Whoopi Goldberg also makes a comeback as Guinan (she notes ""her husbands"" - in Star Trek: Nemesis, she will mention she was married 23 times!). And, it is mentioned again how baseball became an extinct sport.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Evolution (TV Episode 1989)",Wesley the Crusher!,"Nano-technology is an interesting subject for great speculation. It's interesting to me that several reviewers were so annoyed with Stubbs' character flaws that they said he ruined the episode. The guy has devoted his entire life to this one event and may be cheated out of it because Wesley Crusher has lost control of another of his science experiments. Granted, he takes matters into his own hands after Picard has put the kebosh on doing in the little buggers. But there seems to be little animus over Mr. Crusher's outrageous experimentation that could take the lives of the entire crew and destroy the ship. For me, this would be the end of any immediate roadway to the Starfleet Academy. He may just be a kid, but he has intellectual powers that are handled in a slipshod, careless way. Whether these microscopic things are a life form is open to discussion. If your car parts act in concert with each other and your modern flywheel arrangement is able to adapt to changes in need, is your car now a lifeform. I'm with Stubbs on this one. Besides, many geniuses are eccentric and he is sanctioned by the powers that be. If he forced Picard's hand (as well as Momma Crusher's annoying concerns) then it may be he that saved the ship.",7
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Evolution (TV Episode 1989)",That one sentence...,"PLOT (SPOILERS)About to achieve the obsessed Dr Stubbs' once-in-a-lifetime experiment the Enterprise begins to malfunction. Dr Stubbs feels connected to fellow genius Wesley, but it turns out fellow genius Wesley is responsible for everything, allowing 2 aggressive nano-robots to escape because he fell asleep. These nanites are now wreaking havoc on the ship and the mission, not to mention their lives, are in serious danger. Picard can remove them but refuses because he believes they are sentient. Dr Stubbs disagrees by effectively mass-murdering some of them. The nanites accept Data as a mediator and through him a peace settlement is reached, Dr Stubbs achieves his experiment and they warp away without so much as a slap on Wesley's wristTHE GOOD STUFFI was surprised other reviewers were so harsh on Dr Stubbs. I rather liked him but then again I also was alone in liking Kosinski. He doesn't fit in with Starflleet which makes him more real, more believable. I cheered him on when he refused Troi to mentally invade him -honestly he cannot be the only one who objects to this. Troi's habit of just scanning people without their permission is one of TNG's biggest irritations for me personally. I liked the bond he felt with Wesley. I liked Guinan in this episode. I liked the idea of the nanites. And for some part of the show, I finally began to like this more human and flawed Wesley.THE BAD STUFFThat is of course, until he utters a sentence I fricking' hate. When Guinan catches him setting ""mousetraps"" he is forced to admit that everything is his fault. He looks so guilt-ridden and afraid what will happen I actually approved of him. But then Guinan, almost sarcastically, asks what he thinks of the grading for this disastrous experiment. Completely earnest, he responds with ""I always get an A!"" AAARRRGGGHHH are you kidding me? Are you KIDDING me? You almost destroyed your ship and still think you will get top marks? I almost liked him and he says that, returning to his softie know-it-all character we all know and despise. Even yelling at Dr Crusher doesn't rectify this. In the end, Wesley isn't blamed, even though, just to remind you, he fell asleep and nearly killed his crewmates, and no lesson is learned. If this was DS9 Odo would be hunting him down the Promenade.I also disliked Dr Crusher's (yuck) return. She babbles on about her realization that (s)mothering Wesley is bad for him but does little else the entire episode. The end scene where, after deciding to let her son go more, she sees him with a girl and immediately questions Guinan about it is meant to be funny and make us happy that the lovable chagrin of a Pulaski has been replaced with this robotic plastic we call Dr Bev and horribly fails. I know she has fanboys but she doesn't have any depth as an actress or a character and barring one or two episodes the entire character could have been deleted and you would barely notice.CONCLUSIONPerhaps not the spectacular show that was needed to kick off Season 3 but that season is the one that saw TNG finally escaping the long shadow of Kirk and Spock and give us quite a few good episodes. ""The Defector"" automatically comes to mind but there are many more. I like this episode, I liked Dr Stubbs, I liked someone finally telling Troi that she's rude and invasive, I liked Guinan and the nanites, I liked the weighing of nanites as a living people against the value of the experiment (Dr. Stubbs: ""How many viruses have you killed, doctor? And at least that is a recognized form of life.""). I even liked Wesley until he becomes arrogant and annoying again and while I wouldn't call this filler or unworthy of your time, the ending desperately needs Worf chastising Wesley with a Klingon pain stick so that a lesson is learned. I like it but it's not for everyone. 7/10",7

What we get is a dose of stodginess, with long dull scenes, and a preachy moralistic tone.The underlying story about nanites is just ludicrous, and of course we might have guessed it was all Wesley's fault. It's either he who saves the Enterprise, or he who destroys it - a sort of balance I suppose. Watching this episode straight after the end of the previous series - doesn't Data's face look older? A problem they eventually fix in Time's Arrow.On the plus side though, the special effects in the opening are very beautiful, the Enterprise in orbit is gorgeously lit.

Of course, like many of us Trekkers, he's a geek without a personal life. According to the usual Star Trek philosophy that should be OK, but here it's seen as a problem. This episode's message to geeky 17-year-olds who would rather do science experiments than get into trouble is exactly the same as William Shatner's on Saturday Night Live.Granted, this isn't the only time in Star Trek where this offensive theme is found.

Dr. Stubbs (Ken Jenkins; portraying a highly-motivated genius completely determined to see his experiment carried out, with a rather large ego and desperation in seeing his lifelong work succeed without fail) will do his very level best in making sure that his egg is sent into a star, regardless of whether or not he might have to execute intelligent lifeforms (the nanites are reproducing and ""exploring"" throughout the computers of the Enterprise, in turn causing internal and external malfunctions with the shields continuing to go down, turbolift doors opening and closing wildly, sensors indicating a Borg vessel that isn't there, Sousa's Stars and Stripes Forever sounding on the Bridge loudly (!), among other things interrupting the mission at hand). When Stubbs uses gamma radiation to kill a group of nanites with phaser fire, Picard will have to find a way, with help from Data, to communicate with the surviving ones still alive to conduct a peaceful solution that will end the ""conflict"" and help the Enterprise in stopping their disruptions throughout the main computers causing all of the malfunctions. Data might can act as a conduit for the nanites to communicate. The episode also has Gates Mcfadden returning as Dr. Beverly Crusher, a year at Starfleet Medical has kept her from son Wesley so she wants to reconnect and understand how her son's life has been during her absence. However, she is concerned her presence on the ship will interfere with her son's growing and maturation process. Wesley also will have to admit his responsibility in all that has happened, although he is the one who led to the birth of a new species. Fun way to open the Third Season (some consider this the best season of the series, up for debate, but it is a great one), a welcome return for Mcfadden, with nice doses of humor, including all the crazy malfunctions on the Enterprise, and a great guest starring role for Ken Jenkins who has some tense moments with Counselor Troi over her attempts to ""beam into his soul"", wanting him to address the possibility that his egg might miss its launch into the starhe flat refuses to allow her access to his emotions, and even though can sense how he feels, Stubbs won't interact with her in a positive way. Sure he is deliberately guarded, willing to only share when necessary, although he does own up to his mistakes to the nanites when almost killed by them with an electrical charge. He also has some warm moments with Wesley, using baseball as an analogy for the sad failure that could result from not making history with his experiment in astrophysics.",7

She has a new shorter haircut and she looks as good as ever. From an acting perspective she doesn't miss a beat. Some of the crew are looking slightly older, in particular this is noticeable of Data who isn't supposed to change because he is an android (what a challenge from a producer's standpoint!).The main theme song is comprised of two parts, the intro with Picard's Mission Statement, and the actual Theme song. Apparently the Intro's music changes each season - while the statement remains the same. The Intro changed after the first season by adding a droning bassline. In the 3rd season that drone has been modified to be less harsh and more of a background noise but it is still there. Also tinkling bell chimes have been added to the mix to give it depth. The intro video of the planets has changed dramatically, while the Enterprise shots were unchanged(possibly improved special effects is all).

The sets look better, the crew gets spiffy new uniforms, the scripts are better.The season premiere is okay though, we'll call it par for the course.

Her character had improved a lot since her introduction.This episode is pretty standard with no real twists or turns. It all gets solved a bit quickly and neatly in the end though. Data letting these lifeforms take over his body is a dangerous and foolhardy decision but it works out alright in this instance.We get a fun guest appearance with the mean doctor from Scrubs who is obsessed with baseball for some reason.

The writers' on the other hand have gathered together the super-liberal forces of the cast (particularly Picard) to claim that these are possibly life forms, all because of their developing intelligence.This philosophy is degrading to the human mind and absurd in its logic. Clearly, a machine - even if it can improve itself and develop better circuits and capabilities - remains a machine, an automaton, a mechanism that works by logical computation no different from the relays or switches or older pre-electronic age trains, calculators and telephone exchanges.A human being or even animal life, has at its core an identity unconnected with improvements or illnesses that augment or deprecate it.

The Federation can accomplish this but can't get there for three weeks. So this presents two plot elements. First, has to do with the initial treaty (the Sheliak are absolute rule followers) how to circumvent it. Meanwhile, Data is on the planet, trying to convince the leadership (one man, actually) that there is no choice but evacuation. This man has become a godhead to his people and following the prudent course would diminish his authority. He has, in fairness, brought great prosperity to his people, including an aqueduct which will supply them with unlimited water supplies. As Data tells him, this is a ""thing"" and it is worthless if there is no one around to benefit from it. It takes a pretty heavy-handed effort to begin to confront his power. Data is seen as a machine and at one point is disabled. We see signs of this man leading a unilateral march to destruction (not greatly different from the Sheliak).

Meanwhile, Commander Data (not in danger of suffering from the harmful radiation) tries to negotiate with the colonists whose leader, Gosheven (Grainger Hines), is vocal about staying regardless of what the Sheliak might do to them because he believes their ancestors (and them) have fought and died too long for their colony just to up and leave it behind when progress (an aqueduct with drinkable water leading to a mountain and down to the main city) is so close to success. Gosheven's opinion and position are held in high esteem and the colonists are not willing, it seems, to undermine his ruling on their leaving the planet. That said, Data, with help from a colonist, Ard'rian (Eileen Seeley, one of Data's first ""love interests""), an expert in robotics, will try to use methods to change their decision to stay. This episode, from the superb third season, is just another fine example of a maturation process developing for the Next Gen show. Strong writing (how the characters examine their dilemmas, seek a resolution in less time than is permitted, and determine a solution that will keep human lives from being slaughtered), a story demanding characters to improvise in the face of incredible odds (how Data must use action to get his point across about the need to evacuate using a phaser; Picard using the treaty to his advantage), and a satisfying, but intelligent, thoughtful conclusion of both alternating subplots (Data is successful in his mission because he had to resort to necessary violence; Picard closes frequencies when the Sheliak colonist vessel argues with him, taking his time when they hail him) assures the viewer that this show was on its way to becoming an iconic series deserved of its popularity with Trek fans. While past seasons have expressed the desire to develop Data, it was episodes like this one that further examine how he reacts to conflict when logic and rationality often aren't enough. Data's violin concert is used effectively to establish his attempts to pursue human arts, and his critique from a pleased Picard further shows that his efforts are not in vain.",8

However, unknown to both sides, a group of humans settled on a world in the Shelliac system. Now, many years later, the Shelliac are about to colonize this world and want the humans off NOW. And, if they aren't all removed in four days, the remaining ones will be liquidated. But there are two problems. The Enterprise expected only a dozen or so settlers--not many thousand. And, the leader of the settlers is an idiot and refuses to move--even though Commander Data informed him that they will be killed by the Shelliac. At the same time, Picard is finding it difficult to talk with the Shelliac--they are unwilling to change their plans. So what's going to happen...genocide?This was a better than average episode for three main reasons. First, it did NOT stay on the ship and including missions to both the Shelliac and the colony. Second, Data had a relationship with a colonist that was interesting--and gives insight into him and his quest for humanity.

Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword.

It's a two-pronged approach, with Data trying to talk sense with the colonists while Picard faces intimidating legalese with the alien race.In the end, both officers are forced to think outside the box, and that's exactly what makes this so satisfying. Not just that Patrick Stewart and Bent Spiner carry this, but because this episode is very true to both characters. It's a lot of fun seeing Capt.

Curiously, a plot of property and a couple, seemingly human, occupy it while the rest of the planet shows the horrifying fate of the alien attack. Rishon and Kevin (Anne Haney and John Anderson), a couple up in years came to the planet from Earth to settle into their old age, but how they were spared while the rest of the colony perished is quite a mystery. When anyone from the Enterprise beams to the couple's home, Kevin is visibly upset and rather rude, just wanting them to leave Rana so the couple can get on with their lives. Meanwhile, a ship of unknown origin threatens the Enterprise as long as they orbit Rana IVthe question is why? Fascinating episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation which ponders what to do with enormous power if you are a pacifist yet everyone around you is under perilous attack from a superiorly weaponized alien race, fighting for survival. After the away team beams to Rana the first time, Counselor Troi is terrorized by a musical tune (that plays from a certain music box owned by Rishon) that plays over and over in her mind; who has planted this tune in her mind and why? You always feel, from the first moment you see the devastation all around the Uxbridge home, that something is not right. The way Kevin insists that the Enterprise leave and his persistence in receiving nothing from them, there's a huge secret he's hiding. Rishon, however, seems to have a desire to leave but loyalty to Kevin and actually Rana itself are of importance to her. I think most viewers will see that there's a peculiarity in how they behave, considering what happened to the planet. What is hidden that Kevin is protecting? The mystery of the plot results in a tragic reveal that confirms Picard's suspicions regarding Kevin's secret, testing him through certain acts such as saying things just to see if his assumptions are correct (a theory involving the ship and why it doesn't truly destroy the Enterprise when it has a superior arsenal at its disposal and, most importantly, why this alien vessel seems to act out when crew members transport to and from the planet), leaving orbit only to return. Anderson's ornery nature and ultimately his pitiable monologue and unveiling of painful truths at the end really add potency to the episode, paying off a really intriguing mystery with a sad conclusion. Recreation and extinction, too much power used (and not used) poorly, all play into the revelation. Really a memorable episode from the third season with a melancholic vibe that hangs over it as it unfolds.",7
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Survivors (TV Episode 1989)",Right out of 'The Martian Chronicles' by Ray Bradbury,"Bradbury often wrote of the last man on a planet or the last couple. Even the character's name, Uxbridge, sounds like one of his. Of course if the writer of 'The Survivors' was inspired by stories he had read, well as they say, if you're going to steal, why not steal from the best? Bradbury was more of a poet who used science fiction as a setting for stories of human emotion. The best science fiction has a strong human story at its heart. Stories with nothing but whiz bang special effects may be okay for a short time, but we do not return to watch such stories again. Next Generation's 'The Survivors' is the kind of story you watch more than once. It also has a good science fiction twist at the end. Well worth watching.",8

Happens every day, in endless ways.This understanding is not some religious or atheist lesson. People behave this way about endless issues, not just whether god exists or not.

They'll make up oxymora like ""militant atheism"" to defend the dogma, because it's easier to throw nonsensical accusations than to actually start being rational about something.Religious shows can be counted in dozens, atheist shows are pretty rare (there's Star Trek, Star Trek and, at a push, maybe Star Trek), yet that's already too much.

""Who Watches the Watchers"" is no exception. Dark Shadows' own Maggie Evans, Kathryn Leigh Scott has a great part as the female leader, Nuria, of a race of Vulcans named Mintakins similar to humans in that they live in huts and hunt with crossbows. They are considered by the Federation as sensibly thinking realists who have ""abandoned the belief in the supernatural as a deity"", his name the Overseer. They are considered a developing people certain to do great things. An outpost, holographically hidden, with a few scientists monitoring the Mintakins from a safe distance (or is it?) suffers a serious malfunction that sends surges of electric charges that harm them. The outpost reappears and now can be seen by the outside world. A father and daughter Mintakin, Liko and Oji (Ray Wise and Pamela Adlon), are going about their daily routine when the outpost can be seen by them. Liko climbs to see what it is, notices the away team beamed down to rescue the fallen scientists, shocks himself on the electrically charged building, falls a few feet, and is transported by Dr. Crusher's order to the Enterprise. The Pulaski brain wipe doesn't work on Liko and his memories on board the Enterprise remain intact. His stories of a god named the Picard places the Enterprise crew in a difficult position regarding ""contamination"" by interfering inadvertently in the Mintakin way of life, as Liko starts to change his people's views on a powerful deity who can do wondrous, supernatural things, certain he can control the weather or bring loved ones back to life. When the Mintakin's find a missing scientist, Riker and Troi will have to beam down disguised as them hoping to recover him without further damage. Damage control is what I would say Picard tries to implement, even beaming Nuria on board hoping to convince her that he is a flesh and blood lifeform, not a god worthy of worship. Picard is a little ticked off at Crusher for bringing Liko on board, but this is that sticky area where the Prime Directive Federation law, this special philosophy that discourages interference, can possibly be challenged. When Riker is successful in returning the scientist to the Enterprise, Troi is held captive by a conflicted Liko who is afraid that the Picard will be angry for the loss (Liko overheard Picard say he wanted this man back aboard the Enterprise) and might have to punish her to appease him. Conflict in how to correct a series of events that set in motion paranoia and fear based on wrongfully perceived information and that debate on how far to go to halt what could develop into chaos and holy war really places Picard in a fascinating quagmire; seeing him work this out really makes this episode great. This episode has been (or could be) seen by some as a treatise on religion and how belief in a god or God can cause more harm than good. Some passionate dialogue by Picard to the outpost's lead scientist might fuel this even further.

The people researching a race of people (who look like Vulcans) end up blowing their cover. This draws the Enterprise crew into the mix and they are observed by the inhabitants. Beverly, following her Hippocratic oath beams up a native who falls from a precipice when startled. When he awakens on board the Enterprise he sees Picard in a soft light and assumes he is a god who has used his powers to save him. Of course,things get truly complicated because the confusion that ensues presents complex moral situations that need to be remedied.To complicate things, Riker and Troi, dressed like the inhabitants, are stuck on the planet. As they bide their time, trying to convince these people that their beliefs are simply superstitions, a man is captured who had disappeared when all hell broke loose. Since ""the Picard"" is seen as a god, they have to figure out what to do with this incapacitated stranger. Jean-Luc beams the female leader aboard to do what he can to try to show her that they are not gods, the Enterprise isn't Valhalla, and he is only a human at a different stage of history. The prime directive certainly complicates things. It's sort of like the U. S. Bill of Rights. It may not allow you to do what you interpret as right, but at its foundation it is right and proper. Without it, all sorts of bad stuff can happen and civilizations would be changed forever. It also keeps those who think they have all the answers in check. Excellent episode.",9
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Who Watches the Watchers (TV Episode 1989)",One of the Best TNG Episodes... Should Have Been a Movie,"The worst thing about this episode is that it's far too rushed. The concept is intriguing and could easily have been a feature-length film. For a 1980s TV series that was still finding its legs, the acting and story were very good. However, 45 minutes was not enough time and there are obviously gaps in the plot. The most glaring example is that it takes Picard only about 5 minutes of screen time to bring a bronze- age person aboard the Enterprise, educate her about 24th-century medical technology, dispel a return to an ancient superstitious religion, and solve the problems caused by an inadvertent first contact.This episode gets a lot of heat for being anti-religious, but it's really not. The dilemma is that a progressive society is inadvertently contacted by the Federation, which triggers a return to beliefs in an ancient religion based on superstition (the kind where thunder means that God is angry and demands a human sacrifice). At no point in the episode is it asserted that there is no God... in fact, that issue is not even addressed. The issue is the superstitious basis for a religion long since discarded which returns with a vengeance due to the inadvertent contact and ultimately results in Picard being worshiped as a god.",8
10,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Who Watches the Watchers (TV Episode 1989)","I also must refute this so-called ""Atheism"" Angle","This is a great Ep, written by the production team of Hans Beimler and Richard Manning, whose efforts as Producers brought some real quality to the show.Most people haven't heard of Gene Roddenberry's Policy of shying away from Religion in general in most of his work. This Ep Rigidly enforces that policy and embodies it in Picard's attitude.Even at the time I originally saw this ep, and back then I was more of a fundamentalist Christian than I am now - I never considered ""Atheism"" being elevated. These are Proto-VULCANS. Even most Christian Believers accept some kinds of Science Fiction or Speculative Fiction stories, at least when it comes to individual people like myself. Because I never believed that Science and Religion are mutually exclusive.And even people of Faith accept modern cosmology as stated by Einstein, Hawking and Tipler.So why does this STORY of a speculative future bring the bats out of the religion belfry? IN the same way a black president being elected in 2008 has brought back ALL manner of racism that we thought was behind us.This episode - Or rather, the REACTION to this episode, was a precursor to some of the stupid activities of 2011's Right Wing extremists. - When the right reactionary extremists swarm, throw reason out the door. I had heard of this reaction even back when I saw the ep when it was FIRST RUN. I thank God that they were mostly ignored, like they should be even today.Now, where was I? Yes, this story is about an ALIEN race, that has ALREADY discarded, not just one religion, but ALL religions.But then, Ray Wise on one of his great Character Roles, is Beamed Up to the Enterprise and worked on by Dr. Crusher - And remembers what he had seen! Now even today, when human beings witness technology they do not understand, it automatically becomes MAGIC. Until such time as they understand the mechanism underneath the MAGIC, then it is no longer MAGIC but SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY. But even Religion should not be mixed up with MAGIC. And this episode really delves into MAGIC more than Atheism - ""Liko"" was saved by technologies he did not understand, and in order to stay sane, tries to explain it in such a way as to be a Religious Miracle. -Which is NOT WRONG in itself.But Liko took it a step further - In a way, Liko was the ""Right Wing Reactionary"" of this episode, because he believed he had seen a ""Watcher"" SO MUCH that he tried to MAKE everybody else he knew believe it too. And there is nothing wrong with THAT Either, it is basic proselytizing. But what was wrong with Liko's actions, the same way a Reactionary is wrong, is that when it seems that they cannot extend their beliefs to the people around them in a reasonable way, they must CAUSE HARM to another person who does not wish to believe the same thing.THIS IS THE CORE of the episode, not the Faith angle, because lots of people have Faith. Not the MAGIC angle, not really the GOD angle and most definitely not ATHEISM. But the point where Liko decided, that they had to KILL Troi, was the actual point where Liko became Out of Bounds. If a person's FAITH requires them to HARM somebody else, in any way, that Faith should be lost immediately. And since I was quoted out of context, this has nothing to do with ""escalation to athiesm"" it has to do with a religion being used for EVIL.I have seen a lot of Harm caused by people ""Of Faith"" because the State will not kowtow to their belief system and change laws to restrict people in the ways those people believe should be restricted.But all this aside, and the general, HARMFUL actions taken by religious people BECAUSE of this episode, they are forgetting THIS IS A FICTIONAL STORY and a ""WHAT IF"" scenario.Oh, this episode, and the reaction to it, even TODAY, is so much like what is happening in the US at this date of November 13th, 2011: There are no people on Mintaka III, that we know of. We have never been there to find out, you see. Just the same way, the existence of GOD cannot be proved one way or another. Now I personally believe in God, but I will not HARM anyone I know because they REFUSE to believe in God. ""THIS then is, the Message that we have heard of Him, that God is Light, and in Him is No Darkness at All"" - 1 John.If God IS light, then anyone offering HARM to another IN THE NAME of God, is not acting in God's interests. Peesh?",

Sadly, when Picard tries to undo this harm, he accidentally ends up creating a new cult that worships HIM as their god!! So, in trying to undo the damage, they just make things worse!!

But look at everyone arguing. I'd say the writers won! Best part of this episode was hearing a pre incarnate Bobby Hill. Story was borrrrring... Vulcans only believe in logic. Helllooo? So Proto-Vulcans will eventually reject emotionalism and become the ying to the yang that is always sought. Also counselor Troi is not attractive as a Vulcan.

13,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Who Watches the Watchers (TV Episode 1989)",Silly insinuations regarding faith,"I read the reviews here that are defending this episode as ""necessary"" and fantastic, etc. The problem here is not the story necessarily...its the insinuations that are present in the dialogue. I had not seen this episode originally...at least I don't remember having seen it. But, watching it tonight, I found it totally absurd when Picard characterizes the abandonment of belief in the supernatural as an ""achievement"". Belief in the supernatural is characterized as ""superstition, ignorance and fear"". That is total rubbish.So, while one reviewer has stated the following: ""THIS IS THE CORE of the episode, not the Faith angle, because lots of people have Faith.

If a person's FAITH requires them to HARM somebody else, in any way, that Faith should be lost immediately.""I have to partly disagree...because when abandonment of belief in the supernatural is characterized as an ""achievement"" then we are indeed talking about atheism. Granted...Dr. Barron is concerned about Holy Wars and Inquisitions occurring among this primitive race, and the episode rightly characterizes blind zeal as errant...but that is a wholly different discussion than the philosophical discussion regarding the existence of the supernatural. The writers basically failed to deconvolve this hot-button issue from their main point, that of overzealous, errant ""faith"".So...at the end of the day...I saw this as typical ""Hollywood"" side swiping of faith in anything that is not ""scientific"". I love it at the end when Nuria says, ""You have taught us there is nothing beyond our reach"". Huh? Picard just showed her they can't conquer death! Apparently, death doesn't rate!But...still an OK episode despite the silliness. Doesn't hold a candle to Season 7 Episode 7 ""Masks""...perhaps my all time favorite.",6

It wasn't a bad Story and for a NG: Star Trek it was above average. But like many have pointed out this did have a anti religion slant and that bugged me. But what got me more saying WTF? Was the extent the crew went to keep to the Prime Directive. The crew twisted themselves into all sorts of pretzels just to keep their secret. There was more direct ways to get out of the situation, but then again if they did that the show would of lasted 10 minutes.

Indeed","The fundamentalists in question don't appear to be the religious though, all of the secularist fundamentalists seem to be up in arms over some negative reviews of this poorly written and thinly veiled episode (note the copious use of ALL CAPS in their reviews). The violation of the prime directive and the subsequent repeated stomping all over it in pursuit of some ""greater moral good"" to squash any semblance of religion in this culture was one of the worst and most clearly agenda based premises in the catalog of this series.The only thing you need to know about it is Picard's line about religion leading into the dark ages. Check your history bud, the collapse of organized religion after the sacking of Rome and barbarism of the pagans who took over was lead to the dark ages. The monks in the monasteries, more evil religious types in view of the brave new world of TNG, were the preservers of knowledge and helped to get humanity out of those dark ages.But don't let actual human history derail your fundamentalist attitudes and clear agenda in support of a ridiculously poor episode in a usually solid Sci-Fi series.",1

A curious native gets hurt and beamed aboard the Enterprise. He mistakes Picard for a god and soon has his people worshipping ""The Picard"". Riker and Troi go down in disguise to find the missing scientist and talk down this newfound religion, only making things worse. Picard is forced to head down to the planet to save Troi from being sacrificed.I was a bit surprised this episode was so highly regarded when I logged onto IMDb. I thought it was fairly middle of the road as far as TNG is concerned. This ep is apparently a but polarizing for some because of its atheist theme. This surprised me as well; even TOS has atheist themes, this isn't anything new for Star Trek. I'm not sure why we're still arguing about this. It's kind of the point of the whole episode?We get some fun guest appearances though, most notably Ray Wise as the troublemaker that started this all. The alien species design was actually a bit unsettling to me, really odd looking faces. The plot is fine enough without being profound, they do lay it on a bit thick though. A solid 3/5.",6
17,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Who Watches the Watchers (TV Episode 1989)","Polarizing Episode, With An Agenda","This episode promotes the atheist viewpoint, which diminishes its entertainment value for theists who are aware of the assault on the theistic world view. It does not present a reasoned argument, it simply dismisses theistic beliefs as ignorant and primitive. This would be okay if the atheist argument could be proved, or if the theistic argument could be disproved, but with repeatable test results being the standard of current scientific community thinking, neither can be. Therefore productions that present both sides can be enjoyed by thinking, open minded people, whereas productions that disrespect one side so blatantly can only be enjoyed by people who have closed their mind, are motivated more by arrogance than humility, and have little or no respect for fellow humans who have studied the facts and come to a different conclusion.",3
18,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Who Watches the Watchers (TV Episode 1989)","Good story spoiled by obtrusive, patronizing atheism","In most ways this is a top tier NexGen ep. The usual excellent acting, directing and with an acute moral dilemma at the plot's center. This is why it gets a 4/10. Had it been executed with anything less than its usual brilliance, I would have given it a much lower ""score."" This is one of the very, very few Star Trek episodes or movies that I actually find personally offensive. The transparent ""global warming"" nonsense introduced--see below--late in the series run was merely annoying gibberish without scientific basis. THIS episode is an attack on one of my deeply-help personal beliefs.And it didn't have to be that way. The central dilemma, the accidental violation of the Prime Directive, could have been handled without the frontal assault on religious beliefs and the very concept of spirituality. But the writers don't take that tack. Instead of just telling story, the bare-bones of the plot are used to erect a soap-box for the writers' personal beliefs.(For some reason, the Vote drop down box won't let me change the rating to ""4"" from the ""6"" I mistakenly entered.) What spoils it, however, is the almost militant espousal of atheism put into the mouths of the crew of the good ship Enterprise by writers Manning and Beimler (each with eight writing credits for TNG).The central dilemma is the discovery of a ""duck-blind"", used by Federation archaeologists, by the bronze-age inhabitants of Mintaka III--whom the aforementioned archaeologists were studying.This episode is the most virulently anti-religious of any Star Trek TV show or movie I've ever seen. Religion is at worst treated as pathological mania utterly destructive to societies, at best it's treated with a condescension so common to American Academia and Left-wing journalists.Religion, in deed belief in a Supreme Being or God at all is derided, specifically by Picard, as totally devoid of any benefits. This is an extremely shallow view of religion and/or spiritually, one which clangs even more incongruously from an amateur archaeologist like Picard.The scene (at the end of Chapter 5 on the DVD) which best illustrates the attitude toward spirituality occurs towards the end when Picard is having another of the obligatory confabs in the conference room (""Ready Room"", ""Conference Room"", all that on the Bridge and no bathroom! Must've been a long walk in urgent situations).Picard delivers a rant that defines religious belief, and belief in god(s), as the ""dark ages of ignorance and superstition and fear."" A breath-takingly ignorant and narrow-minded view of the history of religion on this planet (let alone other planets in a humanoid filled universe such as Gene Roddenberry's!) would be harder to imagine! One needs only to be acquainted with the FIFTEEN centuries of French nuns who cared for the sick, fed the hungry, clothed the naked and sheltered the gentle from an often brutal, barbaric world. Are those nuns--and a good Frenchman like Picard WOULD well-know this--an example of a ""dark age""? Of ignorant, superstitious fear? Star Trek has always tried to push the envelope by showing the uglier side of our contemporary life by comparing it to an ideal--and idealized--future. Roddenberry created a locus that has allowed for much great story-telling, many great episodes. This isn't one of them. This substitutes the careful construction of a story, for shrill propaganda and a personal agenda.This is one of the rare occasions in which Roddenberry's open-mindedness is not to be found (there is NOTHING like this eps attack on religion and spiritual-people in Old Trek or the 10 movies). Instead the writers's & producers prejudices are paraded as though they are gospel (pun intended). A sad irony for a ""franchise"" which trumpets its open-mindedness and ""tolerance."" Happily, this is a rare exception to the usual run of Trek story-telling. Though it coincided with the elevation of Rick Berman and Michael Piller to ""show-runners"" of NexGen, it didn't mark a trend. Only toward the end of the series run (seasons 6 & 7) did present-day politics again obtrude.The nonsensical late series plot point of warp-drive ""destroying"" space and therefore ""limits"" had to be placed on FTL travel was nothing more than the global warming hoax, without even going to the trouble of trying to veil the Leftist politics with even a smattering of Treknobabble as a cover.(Of course, to casual viewers or non-fans, talk of ""warp drive"" may seem like Treknobabble itself. We Trekkers know how much thicker than that it often got! In fact, Star Trek had an entire department dedicated to nothing BUT creating pseudo-scientific tongue-twisters to make the show sound more future-y.) Bottom line: This is more like an episode of Aaron Sorkin's ""The Left-Wing"" fantasy about a non-existent ""virtuous"" Chief Executive, rather than the Star Trek both conservatives and liberals know and love.",4

Picard is mistaken for a deity by a pre-warp society and has to lay down some logic. You can get a general idea of where this is going: scrutiny over the belief of a god, etc. Naturally, all of this goes down while crewmembers' lives hang in the balance, but regardless, the whole episode's an ideal mixture of science, morality and philosophy. It's intellectual Trek, all the way; and entertaining primarily because of Patrick Stewart's massive skills.7/10 Also, between the Prime Directive and the duck blind, you just know the movie ""Insurrection"" was written after watching this episode.",7

When one of the Mintakins becomes injured, he is carried to the Enterprise for medical service. However erasing the memory fails and he can remember Captain Picard on the Enterprise and believes that Picard is a god that he has heard stories about. Now Picard has to think of a way to prove that he is no god to the Vulcan like people.The first part of the episode was very entertaining and then for some reason the show slowed so much that the viewer was losing interest.

As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 03Upgrading to a better result than the previous season, this one installs the additional morale lessons among all new innovative ideas that are also brimmed with fresh perspective and incredibly productive methods.Who Watches The WatchersNot only witnessing the worshipped but to meeting him in the flesh, this theme works more because it is an aftermath game.

For anyone who has lost a parent, they can relate.But this episode deals with death on different levels. It deals with the concept of the temptation of living in the past and ignoring the reality of loss, and mentions the strength of humanity in overcoming the acceptance of our mortality.There is a great conversation between Data and Riker, where Data questions why we do not equally mourn the loss of those we are close to and those we are not. Riker makes a compelling comment while explaining this to an android, and it ends with Riker saying that if we mourned all loss of life equally, humans would have a much less bloodier past. This episode brought laughs and tears. The ending with Worf and the boy was great, it made Worf out to have a decent and likable character inside of him.",10

It all seems a bit silly because any kid, even a Starfleet kid would just totally freak out at the events in this one. However, like most trek episodes, there is enough in the story to make a feature length movie. It stands to reason therefore, that a lot of potential character and story development has to be cut down to make it fit into 45 minutes. Understandably, it can seem a bit unrealistic at times. Still, great sci-fi provides insights into the human condition by exploring fantasy scenarios, which this episode does, if you can just suspend your disbelief.",7

Marla had a young boy child named Jeremy, on the Enterprise, his father dead of a disease, now all alone. Because he is now an orphan, Worf (also orphaned when the Romulans attacked the Klingons at Kitimer) wants to share R'uustai with Jeremy, a ""brothers"" ceremony called the bonding. But Jeremy will need to come to terms with the pain and anguish, the anger and bitterness he hides behind a façade of bravery and maturity. This will not be easy when a strong energy source from the planet manifests into the form of Marla Aster offering Jeremy a home (an exact replica, including pet cat, of their Earth home) absent all the hurt and suffering that loss of life belies. Picard, Troi, and the others understand that Jeremy must see past the ""mask"" that the energy source puts on Marla's demise, to face and acknowledge the grief and mourning process that comes with losing your mother. Convincing a boy of this will be quite a task, but Troi and Picard will have help from Wesley Crusher who must once again address the loss of his father (...told to him as a child by Picard). With Worf the commanding officer of the away team when his mother was killed, Jeremy will need to get it out so he can release all of the deep emotions buried inside; it is important that he faces Worf who will be a catalyst in drawing out the anguish. This episode, as I have described, is about loss and dealing with it in a healthy way, not embracing a fiction that isn't real even if it looks the part. You see how difficult it is on those who have lost, those who have the duty to tell the ones left behind the bad news, and how this loss never truly leaves, that you just find a way to move on without forgetting about them, cherishing their memory and meaning in your life. Susan Powell is the mother and energy source version of her with Gabriel Damon the child trying to deal with a unique situation. The mother's ""re-emergence"" is quite a stunner: it definitely had me going, ""What the hell?!?!""",8

Several of the crew are impacted by the death of the crew member and it brings out emotions of their previous personal loss.

The B plot of who planted the bombs is underdeveloped so we're left focusing on this terrible child actor and his ghost mom. I like how much Worf we get here but in the end it's Picard and Wes that cause the resolution. We're supposed to get this big parlor scene where Wes pours out his heart about his dad's death but Wheaton isn't a good enough actor to make it resonate. It's a really underwhelming end to a fairly average episode.",5

He was working within the limits of the writing. Susan Powell also put in a solid performance as his mom. I'm rather surprised that those two actors don't even work anymore.Near the end of this episode Picard makes an argument that is very reminiscent of the things that he says in the ""Generations"" movie (my personal favorite from the Trek cannon). Wesley Crusher also lets some inside secrets slip. It's a good episode.",7

Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws.

It's up to Geordi LaForge, with the help of a holodeck version of Dr. Leah Brahms (played by Susan Gibney - she will appear again in ""Galaxy's Child"") as they go into the Enterprise's past to learn about how to deal with the present. In fact, this holodeck Brahms is actually a human representation of the Enterprise computer itself!This episode begins the ""failed romances"" for Geordi LaForge starting with Christi in this episode. Whoopi Goldberg also makes another appearance as Guinan - she mentions that she attracted to bald men. And Picard is seen showing his rare ""happy"" side when we see his love of history (in this case the form of the 1000 year old ship). Also, there's a mention of Picard building a ""ship in a bottle"" which will be a later TNG episode title.Another brilliant episode which continues the strong 3rd season of The Next Generation.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Booby Trap (TV Episode 1989)",Geordi on the Make,"The Enterprise has unsuspectingly gotten enmeshed in an asteroid field that is absorbing power from them. There is also a radiation factor that will ultimately kill the entire crew if something isn't done. It is, as the title indicates, a booby trap that has claimed other victims. It is now up to the resolve of Picard and the technical expertise of Geordi LaForge to come up with a solution. He is stonewalled at each turn and ultimately decides to go into the Enterprises original specs to see what can be done. In so doing he raises the holographic image of Leah Brahms, an engineer most closely associated with this aspect of the ship. It turns out that she is absolutely beautiful (looking like a latter day Ingrid Bergman) and Geordi, who has had a series of failures romantically, gives her a personality that is somewhat teasing and inviting. She is still the master of her craft and gets into shouting matches with Geordi. The parry and thrust at what the Enterprise can do to solve the problem. There are some wonderful scenes as Picard maintains his cool despite a problem of gargantuan implications. Very good science fiction, utilizing one of the crew's most interesting characters. .",9
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Booby Trap (TV Episode 1989)",Star Trek The Next Generation--Booby Trap,"A Promelian Battle Cruiser (an ancient ship of war considered destroyed during a major destructive conflict with a race called Menthars, that ended with asteroids and wreckage as a reminder of just how devastating war can be) is discovered at Orelious IX thanks to ""an ancient interplanetary code"" that was sending out a distress signal the Enterprise discovered while charting the war between two alien species who battled until both were extinct.The Enterprise experiences energy loss and technical malfunctions while holding near the Promelian ship (within the asteroid scattering), soon losing all power as radiation will infiltrate their ship if an answer isn't uncovered to escape from a ""booby trap"" energy field siphoning off their resources.Picard taxes Geordi LaForge on finding a way to maintain the Enterprise's shields and the chief engineer must get a little assistance from Dr. Leah Brahms, responsible for most of the design of the ship, including the Dilithium Chamber in Engineering. Through her logs, information stored in the computer banks, and even recreating her personality and image for Geordi, they will try to figure out a way to give the Enterprise enough energy to somehow make it out of the energy field caused by the Menthars' radiating asteroids. An idea of allowing the computer itself to direct the Enterprise through asteroid field is at first contemplated, but it could come down to old fashioned experience and ingenuity, using their brains, their mind instead of depending on machine to get them out of this predicament.The is classic Trek, really, and functions as a fine vehicle for Levar Burton who would have a fabulous third season with a heaping helping of storyline dedication given to him and he delivers. It's classic Trek in that it has an inexplicably difficult problem burdened on Picard that involves keeping his ship operational as an energy field with radiated rock surrounding it gradually deprives it of what it needs to remain active and running. Geordi earns his Chief title in this one, having to look at the Enterprise back at the beginning, to get an understanding of how to increase energy levels as to prolong their life support and hold off radiation exposure before it turns fatal to the crew of the ship. We see the ship darkened, the computer reminding them of deflector shields failing, and the crew growing concerned, yet Picard's impeccable resolve and ability to stare right into death and keep his composure is a statement in regards to his character and command. This also allows us to see Geordi dealing with ""woman issues"" trying to figure out how to score with a young woman named Christi (Julie Warner, of Doc Hollywood fame) who doesn't seem romantically interested in him while he finds himself falling in love with a holographic image and personality cribbed from various resources by the computer. Susan Gibney, as Leah, radiates in her role and leaves quite an impression; once we get an indication of what she really seems like, you can understand why Geordi responds so warmly to her. This episode also shows Picard in a jovial, enthusiastic state after visiting the ancient ship he read about as a child, providing amusement to his crew. This also has the ""ship in the bottle"" comment by Picard, befuddled that Riker, Worf, and Data are baffled by this boyhood activity. Picard has a really nice moment with Riker where he dotes on the imaginary adventures he had while building model ships; that, and their conversation on flying machines and machines now flying them also resonates. Include the discovery of a ship so fitting for study and holding possible clues as to how to right the wrongs that left the dead crew to perish, Data trying to make some of the Promelian Captain logs presentable as to learn from his mistakes, and ""Booby Trap"" is just another example of how The Next Generation began to excel in the third season.",9
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Booby Trap (TV Episode 1989)",This episode reflects the true Star Trek,"When the Enterprise hears an old distress signal they happen to come up on an 1000 year old Promelian ship that was involved in a war with the Menthars so many years ago. It seems that over one thousand years ago the ship sent out the distress signal, due to some reason, being unable to get out of an asteroids belt so the crew perished.Now the crew of the Enterprise goes to investigate the ship but after returning to the Enterprise they find out that they are losing power and radiation will flood the ship if the shields do not hold up to the decrease in power. It seems that Enterprise is in the same bobby trap that the Promelian ship was in many years ago.Geordi will have to find a way, with help from records of Doctor Leah Brahms hologram files, to save the Enterprise from a certain disaster. This will prove to be an interesting trip to the holodeck where we learn more about Geordi than we have learned so far in the series. We also get to see an usual excited Picard, early in the show, when he gets to head an away team to the stranded Promelian ship. An entertaining episode that is exactly what we expect when we watch the series. Great watch.",8
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Booby Trap (TV Episode 1989)",Back to basics,"'Booby Trap' is a fine example of the demand for miracles a captain places on his chief engineer. A distress call lures the Enterprise into an immobilizing energy field, while lethal radiation levels continue to increase on board. To escape it, Geordi takes the holodeck with a recreation of the grand matriarch of modern propulsion. It's kind of refreshing that, in the end, simply killing the power and steering in the wind does the trick. It's a very low-tech solution, which is a surprise for this show.One good thing about this is we get to see Picard's lighter side as he reminisces about building a ship in a bottle as a boy. The downside is LaForge's nonexistent love life, which has him romancing holograms. But it's a good dramatic episode and the worsening situation in the trap offers great tension.7/10",7

Both sides destroyed the other and little is left except an exploded planet--a vast monument to the stupidity of war. While in this region, the ship begins receiving distress signals from a long-dead ship. Naturally, the Captain is curious and an away team investigates. However, once near this ship, they realize that they, too, are in trouble. The same devices that caused this ancient ship to become stuck in space are now holding the Enterprise firm. Additionally, something in space is now causing a HUGE drain on the ship's energy as well as bombarding the ship with lethal radiation. It sure looks like they are screwed. To deal with this seemingly insurmountable problem, Geordi brings up a holo-creation of a brainiac scientist who built the Enterprise and together they look for a solution to their dilemma.The other theme in this one is LaForge's pathetic dating life. It begins with him completely striking out with a fellow crewmember and ultimately ends with him becoming infatuated with the holo helper. Will LaForge ever get to meet this lady in person? Yup--two years later she'll re-appear in ""Galaxy's Child"" and you'll learn whether the real Dr. Brahms is anything like her holo alter-ego.In some ways this episode is quite original and interesting. But, like many of the lesser episodes, just about everything (other than a brief landing on the dead ship they discover) takes place aboard the Enterprise--making the show a bit stagy and slow.

It's up to Geordi and a holodeck woman he's created from an old Enterprise designer to come up with the solution before all the ship's power is drained and the radiation kills the whole crew.This is the first Geordi-centric episode we've really gotten and it sort of introduces his character traits of being super weird around women. Lots of people hate this about the chief engineer but I find it a bit hilarious. He becomes the second crew member so far to fall for a fake woman from the holodeck.I like Picard in this one and is fascination with this pristine ""ship in a bottle"".
He's really giiddy about the whole thing until they're put in danger.
The plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me though and that's why I rate it a bit lower than most. Like why is Geordi the only one on this entire ship working on this problem? Why isn't Wes and Data helping them? Or their entire staff of engineers? It's makes no sense.And then I don't really understand the resolution. They couldn't get out of this web before so now why does a burst of power (similar to what they've already tried) suddenly free them and allow them to coast out of here?There's a lot of technobabble (which I'm a sucker for) but I couldn't make heads nor tails of how they got out of this predicament.",6

0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Enemy (TV Episode 1989)",Wonderful episode.,"I could write a very long review of this episode, but I'll try to keep this brief. This is one of my very favorite episodes in the Star Trek franchise - Star Trek doesn't get any better than this. The script is expertly-written, and the episode deals with some very weighty issues in a very impressive manner. The acting is superb - especially from Michael Dorn, LeVar Burton, and the actor who plays one of the Romulan survivors on the planet. The characters are deep and very well-developed, and the storyline gets better and better throughout the entire episode. I highly recommend it.It's also one of the best episodes to show your friends who are not familiar with this franchise. It requires very little understanding of the Star Trek universe to enjoy. It is also a very intelligent episode, with a myriad of references to history, politics, racism, duty, honor and trust. If you watch this, I hope you'll agree with me that it compares very favorably to any expertly-written drama on television.",9
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Enemy (TV Episode 1989)",One of LeVar Burton's best performances....,"When LeVar Burton was cast in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" in 1987, he brought a rock solid range of acting skills and a lot of heart to the show. As the series went on, he got to play a very solid engineer. However, within the technical dialogue and all the plots involving the ensemble cast his ability to show off his range seemed cut back sometimes.... at least in my opinion. But in this one the writers let him carry a show and act and he nailed it all. Watch for a solid performance from Mr. Burton here and a good job from a guest actor or two... or more.. and watch for another good twist from Michael Dorn, who actually got to give some input to the show... when the writers allowed him to decide what decision his character would make at a certain point. It proved quite influential on the progress of the episode. All the regulars are solid, the guest actors are spot on, and watch for Burton as he gets to go on a bit of a field trip from engineering.... Too bad for him, Risa this ain't!",
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Enemy (TV Episode 1989)",Well written and well performed episode,"LeVar Burton gets to be the lead for the second straight episode as he is finds himself alone on a planet that has powerful ionized storm which is making using the technology of the Enterprise very difficult. Geordi was part of an away team investigating the planet, called Galandon Core, and find a Romulan ship with an injured crew member. Since this was in Federation territory this is a major violation in the Federation/Romulan treaty. That is when Geordi gets left behind only to find himself alone with another Romulan officer on a planet which the ionized storm is slowly killing them.Another situation is back aboard the Enterprise when they find out that the injured Romulan is in need of a transfusion. But after checking everyone on the ship the only match would be Worf. But the problem is that Worf will not submit to the transfusion since the Romulans are the ones that killed his parents.An interesting episode that was enjoyable the entire time. Both situations had great moments and were shining performances by LeVon Burton and Michael Dorn. Another good episode in early season three season.",9
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Enemy (TV Episode 1989)",A Moral Dilemma Clumsily Handled Yet Compelling To See,"This episode is one of the better written and acted ones with two plots happening at once connected by two Romulan enemy soldiers: One that is dying on the Enterprise and one in danger of dying on an asteroid called Galarndon Core. The first story, in which the ill alien can only be saved by a transfusion, is the less compelling tale. Worf is the sole available donor but cannot get past his hatred of Romulans for killing his Klingon parents. Picard tries to convince him to go through with the transfusion, aware that it won't look good for the Enterprise if the soldier dies while in Federation custody. However, the captain feels he can't order Worf to do this. In the battle between Worf's hatred and the limited time the Romulan has, the enemy loses out.The second subplot is better. Geordi Laforge misses his transporter window of opportunity and is stuck on the asteroid, which has an ionized atmosphere that wreaks havoc on humanoid nervous systems. That is what killed the first soldier and is now killing the second one that, unbeknownst to Geordi, is also trapped on Galarndon Core. The only hope for Geordi is to find a beacon that the Enterprise sends him to locate the safe transporter location. Normally, that would be no problem, as he can track it with his visor. Unfortunately, the ionized air is causing the interface between his brain and the visor to disintegrate. The enemy soldier knocks Laforge out and takes him prisoner. When Geordi wakes, he realizes the soldier is in trouble and he soon will be, too. His enemy---whose name is Bochra---must become his ally when the Romulan loses the ability to walk and Geordi loses the ability to see.This episode is tight, well-directed and solidly produced, and the acting was spot on. John Snyder as the strangely honorable Bochra was particularly intense. The Romulan commander was also well-played by Andreas Katsulas. There was good tension from the unresolved dilemma faced by Worf and its results, in that the Enterprise almost comes under attack when Picard admits that the Romulan soldier died in Federation custody. The conflict is averted when Geordi and Bochra are beamed safely to the bridge of the Enterprise and the commander is told by his still-living soldier of how honorably he has been treated. Overall, a good Next Generation episode.",7
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Enemy (TV Episode 1989)",Star Trek The Next Generation--The Enemy,"Star Trek The Next Generation would follow up on their ""The Neutral Zone"", from the first season, with ""The Enemy"", to further illustrate the fragile ""peace"" between The Federation and The Romulans. An unidentified craft located on a Federation planet, Galorndon Core, under heavy electrical storms that run havoc to the nervous system of humanoid beings, as well as, disrupting the ability to communicate, use tricorders for readings beyond five meters, and creating ""ghosts"" that leave Chief O'Brien in a difficult position to transport away team members on the planet when ""windows"" (moments when the storm doesn't interfere, allowing clear readings to pick up people on the planet) don't exist.The wreckage on the planet is of a Romulan vessel which had been purposely exploded, but why it is on a Federation planet to begin with raises obvious suspicions (considering the fact that, according to the treaty, if a Romulan ship crosses a neutral zone, a total violation—separating Federation space from Romulan space—it would be declared an act of war) to Picard. When a dying Romulan officer is found in bad condition on the planet (he tries to strangle Word immediately), he is incapacitated by Worf, brought aboard the Enterprise. Geordi, however, walks into a hole, with Riker and Worf unable to find him. Having to transport due to the window's closing, Riker must leave Geordi behind temporarily.Making matters worse, a Romulan warbird is at the Neutral Zone border, wanting to cross over to retrieve his officer, but Picard insists he doesn't break the treaty due to the violation it represents. Trying to locate Geordi when the window isn't available will cause problems in itself, but Wesley Crusher comes up with the idea of a probe emitting neutrinos that might be noticeable to LaForge's visor which could pick them up. But Geordi has a development he couldn't have prepared for—a second Romulan. Centurion Bochra (John Snyder) smacks Geordi in the back of the head; holding his phaser on Geordi, Bochra is the victim of falling rocks from a high mountain that topple on him. Even as Geordi helps him, Bochra still holds his phaser on him. The two will have to work together as the electric atmosphere is starting to cause physical harm to Geordi and Bochra (Bochra is starting to get body tremors and suffering mental deterioration and Geordi's vision is deterred because the electrical interference from his visor).Meanwhile the Romulan on board the Enterprise is about to die unless someone donates blood needed to restore him to health. The only one compatible—in a twist of irony only Trek could give us—Worf is the only one with the properties in his blood that can be used. Will Worf be able to put aside his hatred for Romulans or will he let the dying officer perish? That moral dilemma is commonplace in Trek. The planet is quite a nightmare, basically uninhabitable if you wish to use technology; dark, full of electrical charged atmosphere, and heavy winds, one can barely walk much less live on such a waste of planet in space. Seeing Picard trying to avert a war with the Romulan empire, having to risk being destroyed at the end when it will take lowering his shields in order to transport Geordi and Bochra to the Enterprise, and trying to convince Worf to agree to the transfusion (of course as his physician, Dr. Crusher expects him to just agree); all in a day's work when you are the captain on board the Enterprise.The second Geordi episode in a row and I couldn't be happierit was really nice seeing some treatment towards him, and through Burton's character, an actual partnership develops between a Federation officer and an untrustworthy Romulan officer. In the Trek universe, stories allow for such complications as a means to explore how two men from totally different worlds must co-exist in order to survive. Trusting the other man when you are unsure of the results—making such difficult decisions—are part of what makes Star Trek so special. Worf's decision was practically made for him when the dying Romulan officer told him he didn't want his Klingon blood polluting his body (he calls it ""Klingon filth""). Being a fan of Babylon 5, it was cool seeing Andreas Katsulas as a Romulan Commander incensed with Picard for allowing his officer to die instead of bringing him to the Neutral Zone. Katsulas would bring that sly, false-smiling, potentially-treacherous personality to his B5 character, G'Kar and it fits a Romulan trying to keep the intentions of his people being in Federation space illegally (he claims it was a piloting error!) perfectly. You can just look at him and tell he wouldn't dare be on the up-and-up with the Federation on anything that divulges possibly real sinister intent on the part of the empire. I really enjoy the interactions between Katsulas and Patrick Stewart as both play the exchange of ship leaders as expected. Picard knows Katsulas' Commander Tomalak is full of it, while Tomalak's sole purpose is to conceal secrets and keep the Federation from knowing the real reason why the Romulans were on that planet. It is all a game and the two actors are exciting to watch. To avoid war and how Picard does so has always been a pleasure to watch to me. In this episode, it is no different.",8

The rest of his team has to return to the ship and leave him behind. The others have found an injured Romulan and have brought him to sick bay. The Romulans, liars that they are, have invaded the neutral zone and are doing all kinds of posturing. Picard is afraid that if the guy dies, it will set up reason for the Romulans to go to war with the Federation. Meanwhile, Geordi gets out of his predicament and is exploring to find a way to contact the Enterprise. He is struck on the back of his head by another Romulan who is ill. When LaForge awakens, he can't reason with his captor. This race is dedicated to war and conquest and to cotton to Geordi's wishes would be seen as weakness. Unfortunately, the storm that has caused so much misery is a symptom of a kind of radiation on the planet that is making the Romulan sick and disorienting Geordi. On board, there is a kind of brinkmanship going on as Picard tries to reason with his adversaries while trying to figure out what is up with his engineer. Also, there is an issue with Worf. His mother and father, who were killed by Romulans, are constantly in his mind. Crusher realizes that the only thing that will save their ""guest""s life would be a transfusion from Worf. This puts him a in serious moral dilemma. There is a scene where he is called in front of Picard. It's obvious he will give the blood if Picard orders it. Picard simply dismisses him.

However, they are surprised when they find an injured Romulan in this stormy place. When it's time to return with this injured enemy to the beam-out point, LaForge is left behind---and they cannot locate him on this hellish place and there is too much atmospheric disturbance to allow their super-high tech instruments to find him. Can they find LaForge AND why was there a Romulan here in Federation space...and are there more?!What follows is a plot strongly inspired by films like ""The Defiant Ones"". In other words, LaForge meets up with ANOTHER Romulan in the storm and BOTH need to work together to survive. Not surprisingly, their relationship is rocky and trust is a major problem--but there is no other way to make it off this awful planet.This episode was good for many reasons. First, it wasn't stuck on the Enterprise. Second, it had the Romulans--and that is always a plus! Third, it's well written and interesting throughout. The only negative is that the plot involving cooperation between LaForge and the Romulan is not exactly novel. For fans of ""Babylon 5"", this is a nice chance to see Andreas Katsulas (""G'Kar"") in a different sci-fi series. Here, he plays Romulan Commander Tomalak--the first of several times.

Meanwhile another Romulan sits in Sick Bay needing a transplant and the only possible donor is a reluctant Worf. Picard communicates with a Romulan captain who is bringing his ship across the Neutral Zone in order to retrieve Romulan survivors, much to Picard's chagrin.I'm a big fan of this episode. I love Geordi's interaction with his enemy-turned-ally in that Romulan. Worf's decision not to be a donor for the Romulan was actually a twist I didn't see coming. I assumed either Picard or Riker would be able to convince him otherwise but he stood his ground in his racist beliefs. While not out of character of Worf, it still took me by surprise. Picard's rivalry with the other captain is pretty solid too.This is an all-around good episode. I wouldn't put it on the ""absolute classic"" level but this one's definitely rewatchable.",8

The second part was wondering what Worf would decide regarding saving a dying Romulan. I'm glad he made the decision that he did, and that Picard didn't order him to do anything. His decision was a good way to remind us that Worf is not human. He's a Klingon and he'll rationalize things like a Klingon. Good stuff.

At the same time in this Troi episode, she meets one of the negotiators, Devinoni Ral (played by Matt McCoy) who turns out to be ruthless and successful - even to the point he's determined to win Troi's love regardless the costs. There Ferengi also make an appearance in the bidding war.Trivia note: this is the first episode we see Troi's love of chocolate when she asks the food dispenser in her quarters for a ""real chocolate sundae"".

It's one of my favorites.Here, there are negotiations over the ownership of the first stable wormhole known to exist, and Troi begins a tumultuous relationship with a handsome opposing negotiator. This allows some development of Troi's character and also shows how her relationship with Riker has evolved since the first season.In ways, this episode foreshadows Deep Space Nine. Not only is there a stable wormhole, but the Ferengi here are more comical than evil (granted, they are still evil, not at all purely comical as in DS9). There are other comical parts here too, like Troi's argument with the ship's computer in the opening scene.The worst thing: The ridiculous workout outfits that Troi and Dr. Crusher wear.",
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Price (TV Episode 1989)",Star Trek The Next Generation--The Price,"Really, ""The Price"" is a Deanna Troi episode, with a subplot including bidding negotiations on a supposedly stable wormhole (the first ever) with delegates from certain planets (Federation, Chrysallis, Ferengi, etc) hoping to secure its rights. Troi finds herself drawn to Devinoni Rai (Matt McCoy), of the Chrysallis, a deceptive, cunning negotiator who will use whatever methods he can to get rights to the wormhole. The Ferengi's lead negotiator, Daimon Goss (Scott Thomson), is also not above using nefarious methods to get closer to attaining rights to the wormhole, even using an invisible poison during a handshake with the Federation negotiator, leading to the man's temporary coma. Picard places himself at an accidental disadvantage when he agreed to be the middle man during the negotiation process, removing the possibility of his stepping in to be Federation's lead negotiator, handing over responsibilities to Riker. Riker and Rai aren't just rivals at the negotiating table; Devinoni brings Troi into the conversation as if she were a pawn to be doled out as well. McCoy has quite the smug, confident, aggressive character, moving quite fast with Councelor Troi (much to her liking), with her agreeably allowing him to advance with her sexually in relatively short order. Picard will want to test the wormhole, sending Data and Geordi in a shuttlecraft through it to see how stable it really is on the other end. Goss sends his Ferengi officers in their own pod, leading to hilarious results when they don't listen to the warnings from Data and Geordi when they discover that the end of the wormhole sent them to a totally different quadrant than expected. Geordi realizes (when looking at the wormhole through his visors) that the wormhole will soon be completely unstable, with the shuttlecraft returning to the Enterprise with the news. Rai plays his hand by securing the rights to the wormhole, through underhanded means (negotiating with the other delegates, offering concessions to them if they agree to back out), while the Federation get out of a potential hot mess thanks to Geordi and Data's findings.I have no qualms with allowing Troi to have development. Thing is she's played like a fiddle by Rai who immediately captures her attention, lust, and heart. They talk about running away together while lying together in her bed. He massages her feet, they kiss passionately on the first date, and it is pretty much acknowledged that the two have sex before even going out to dinner! It moves quickly with these two. I think Troi has some really great episodes down the road, but this one doesn't exactly do her any favors. It is a bit ridiculously whirlwind. Troi does admit that she may be allowing things to move a bit too fast when doing stretching exercises before an aerobic workout with Beverly Crusher. But when Rai throws her up in Riker's face during a ""sizing up"" chat, it truly demeans Troi, I think. I like how Riker tears Rai down to size, too, for using her to get under his skin. The ending leaves Troi having to give tough love to Rai after he uses the last treacherous maneuver left to secure the rights, not knowing the wormhouse he sneakily won over is worthless. He still wants her to ""be his conscious"" but she informs him she already has a job as counselor. Ouch.",5
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Price (TV Episode 1989)",A slow story that seem to go on forever.,"This episode is a gift to Marina Sirtis (Dianna Tori) to try and develop her, so-far, one dimensional character. But instead of giving Tori a pathway to create a more interesting and involved character, they give her a plot where she looks like more like a 'women-of-the-night' than a respectable member of the Enterprise crew.It begins when the Enterprise is in orbit around the planet Barzan that has a stable wormhole nearby. They are in negotiations along with the Chrysallis and the Ferengi over rights to the wormhole. But little does anyone know, the Chrysallis negotiator Devinoni Ral, a nice outward looking fellow, is part Betazoid and can read a person's feeling while negotiating. He is also rather nasty person that will do, say or use anything just so his side gets the best over another in any situation. And for some reason Counselor Troi hops in bed with the slick agent and actually abets him by not revealing the truth about the good-looking negotiator.An uninteresting episode that seemed way slow in developing. The part of the story that concerned the wormhole was a good story but when it was paired with the Troi/Devinoni relationship, it got old fast. The best part of the episode was between Geordi and a Ferengi shuttle-craft operator concerning the wormhole becoming unstable. But other than that short moment, there is little to entertain in this slow and uninteresting offering.",3

One of the men on the ship is a handsome man who immediately is attracted to Troi and she to him. He is masterful at his job and usually gets what he wants. He tells Deanna that he is himself part Betazoid, and she comes to realize that this gives him an unfair advantage over others. She begins to suspect that he has no moral compass, but it is hard for her because she is generally pretty lonely. This episode does drag a bit and alliances are formed. Unfortunately, a discovery is made that changes things. I will leave that to those of you who wish to watch this offering.",6
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Price (TV Episode 1989)","A bit of a prelude to ""Deep Space 9"".","I would definitely agree with kfo9494's review of Counselor Troi in the series so far--her character has been incredibly one- dimensional (and often annoying I would add). This episode is a chance for Marina Sirtis to do more with this know-it-all character---though this opportunity wasn't fully realized. We see here that Troi is a bit of an 'easy girl' (I am trying to be delicate here), this isn't one of the character's finer moments! After all, she JUST met this new guy and almost instantly she's a sex machine! Perhaps they have eliminated STDs in the 24th century and Troi is just taking full advantage of this! But, even if this doesn't offend or annoy you, her actions seem amazingly shallow and silly--and don't do a lot to give her character depth.A group of delegates have arrived to bit on rights to the only known naturally occurring wormhole. This wormhole will allow whoever controls it to travel bazillions of light-years almost instantly--and it obviously is worth a huge fortune. Among the several delegates are the sneaky and rather comical jerks, the Ferengi, and a guy named Devinoni Ral who seems more interested in getting his groove on with Troi than negotiating. He also, incidentally, is a real jerk.The idea of the wormhole would be the basis for the soon to air series, ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" (1993), so in this sense ""The Price"" is an important episode. But the whole relationship angle with Troi and Ral seemed incredibly contrived and difficult to believe in the least. Too bad the writers didn't take this opportunity to do more with Counselor Troi--clearly and opportunity missed. Overall, despite the whole wormhole angle, a very slow and unsatisfying show.",3

My favorite part was Riker's response to Ral when he tries to toss Troi in his face, and Troi's dismissal of Ral with: I already have that job.
As for everyone having an issue with Troi ""hooking up"" with Ral so quickly, funny how nobody complains when Riker pretty much does the same thing every other episode. What's the problem there, folks?

But other cultures are interested in this wormhole as well, notably the Ferengi, and two other races with scientific interests. A human negotiator representing the Chrysalians shows up on the Enterprise and quickly woos Troi. She soon finds herself with a conflict of interest when she learns the man is part Betazoid and uses his powers unethically during negotiations. Meanwhile Data and Geordi take a pod into the wormhole with some Ferengi to make sure it really is stable.The main storyline here is the romantic intrigue between Troi and Ral. I don't think they get the tone quite right though and it makes for the episode's most boring scenes. And to make matters worse Ral's ""courting"" of Troi is entirely misogynistic. The writers turn this three dimensional empathic character into a sex object for their male gaze. It's uncomfortable.Watching Ral negotiate with other races and his showdown with Riker are probably the best scenes. The big finale scene leaves a lot to be desired. The only thing of real importance here is the two Ferengi that get left on the opposite side of the wormhole.I also like the shot of the Ferengi flirting at the bar...",2

The episode offered our first real look at a stable wormhole-type scenario that would be ultimately further explored in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. The emotional tap dance between Troi and Ral was fun to watch, though by today's standards (and perhaps even by 1989's), Ral's passes at Troi were a bit too abruptly forward and predatory. But this is television, and writers only have 45 minutes to develop such trysts. Actor Matt McCoy really has fun with his character, and here he reminds me of a suave, but geeky, young John F. Kennedy.The humor in ""The Price"" is particularly fun, with most of the comic relief coming at the expense of the Ferengi. The showdown between Riker and Ral in Ten Forward marks one of the best duels in Trek, with Riker satisfyingly putting Ral in his place.""The Price"" is an underrated TNG episode, likely because the story is more about manipulation and ethics rather than space battles and time warps.

However, no one realizes that Marouk's servant, Yuta, has a blood feud and she couldn't care less about the peace--she just wants revenge for some personal vendetta.

5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Vengeance Factor (TV Episode 1989)",Good emotional episode of TNG,"I agree with an earlier review that Riker could have beamed Yuta straight to the brig instead of vaporizing her. I can't count how many TNG/Voyager episodes have featured miracles of sensors + transporter technology, but that would have robbed the audience of the 1 on 1 conflict. It was important for Riker to make the awful choice and live with it. The ending in 10-forward with Riker not really caring about an upcoming shore leave shows that. I like how the 3rd season featured a darker, more emotional progression for the series. I watched TNG on first run and it was very clear even back in 1990 that the show had reached a new level compared to the early seasons.",

Just seems that would've been more true to the idea that vengeance unchecked can only harm, not bring closure. And given that Lisa Wilcox, as mentioned elsewhere, gives quite the nuanced yet bravura performance, leaving her alone to face the failure of her quest would have been perhaps a more appropriate ending--I myself had the impression that Yutah would have looked at death as a relief.",7

The premise is not bad. This is the type of mission Star Fleet should be running out in space. Picard is a good arbitrator, so all this makes perfect sense.Even the negotiation scenes are salvageable. Chorgan and the Sovereign's conversations can almost be classified as interesting. What I can't get by is the big reveal that Yuta is actually like an 80 year old wizard. The writers wave a magic wand and don't really explain how her tribe compiled their life forces and created some Ubermensch that doesn't age and has the magical ability to give men heart attacks with her mind. No one else of her race seems to possess any powers or abilities near what she has. They could have at least set up this premise a bit better.Riker killing her isn't bad...

Eventually, Picard recognizes that inaction could be worse than action and proceeds to the ""location"" of the outpost. The strength of this offering is that it is not unlike an episode of ""The West Wing"" where there is political brinkmanship. Picard even asks Data to maintain a record of these events because he would be the only likely survivor of a full battle, to show how it all came about and how it ended.

4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Defector (TV Episode 1990)",One of the best episodes,"I 'accidentally' watched this episode long before I became a Star Trek fan (my ex-girlfriend had lived in Seattle for 6 years and promptly introduced me to it several years later). I came home from a night on the town at maybe 3 AM, which was the time these reruns were shown on Norwegian TV back in the early 90's.I was gripped by the story of this episode, but more importantly the acting. This was the first thing I had seen featuring Patrick Stewart, and I thought he was amazing along with guest star James Sloyan, and I was wondering why this show didn't air in the daytime/prime-time so that everyone could see it.Norway has never been known to show sci-fi during prime-time though, and most Norwegians that admit to liking it are kind of cast-outs and are not taken seriously in other matters if they admit it. It's not like in the USA where even presidents admit to know of and even quote Kirk and Spock and even name space shuttles after it.Anyway, since then I've watched every Star Trek episode (except TOS. Too dated for my taste) and movies (movies with the TOS cast are great) several times, but this still stands out as one of the best installments in any Star Trek media that I know of so far, mainly because of the acting.And the best thing with this episode: Riker (Jonathan Frakes, the worst actor in Star Trek history, in my humble opinion) does not do any of his annoying moves: His left eyebrow lowered when he attempts to look 'mean'.His head cocking to one side when he's puzzled by something.His stumbling, tilted moves when he pretends to look tough in action scenes (imitating John Wayne or some other action hero from the 50's)His exaggerated speech when he pretends to be in distress (""Aaannyboodyyyyy!"" taken from the first episode of TNG) His over-acting in general.In this episode he actually appears normal and professional, just like the other actors.My first impression of this episode back in the beginning of the 90's or something when I had been out on town was maybe infused by alcohol, but I just saw the episode again now, and I stand by it.Highly recommended!",10
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Defector (TV Episode 1990)",One of the Finest examples of a vision.,"During the height of the Cold War in the '60's, G.

Proof of that is that today we are still praising film and written examples of mankind overcoming our own differences and faults, uniting as one, and thereby becoming an example for all life. Anywhere.The crude and poor resources of the '60's TV industry managed in getting this ideal across, otherwise, we would not be here 50 years later discussing this.ST-TNG (so far) has been the pinnacle of this vision. This episode stands as one of the best example of it.Patrick Stewart's background in Shakespearian acting really comes across here, and sets the standard for all of the others. And they all rose to the challenge and delivered amazingly.This stands as one of the best episodes of ST-TNG, when it was in it's prime! The feelings, tension, and drama it shows are far beyond the capability of those behind the latest movie efforts to carry on the ST storyline.Some alien somewhere has 10 thumbs, and they are all 'Up' for this one.",10
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Defector (TV Episode 1990)",Star Trek--The Next Generation--The Defector,"Fantastic episode of the Star Trek—The Next Generation proves, once again, that before the Borg gobbled up a bit of the villainy that occupied a lot of the show's attention, the Romulans always had a place at the table. ""The Defector"" is a choice selection if you are wanting to groom potential fans of the show interested in the Romulan threat as it concerns an Admiral Jarok (James Sloyan; really solid), hiding under the identity of a logistics officer defecting from his home world in an effort to warn the Federation of an impending invasion, outposting on a world called Narvanna III, wanting to prevent long-scale war that he feels would leave his people forever damaged. Picard must determine if Jarok is telling him the truth. He will listen to what Jarok has to say, as well as, receive counsel from his officers and his Federation superiors in order to decide whether or not to enter the Neutral Zone, traveling to the world, risking possible retaliation by Romulans. Sloyan is, in no small part, one of the major reasons ""The Defector"" is so powerful, and the episode certainly has quite the tragic conclusion. Through Sloyan, we see that Jarok is genuine in his desire for peace between his world and others, tired of the casualties of war, but his decision to try and protect his people through his defection comes with a heavy burden, a price he feels is worth leaving behind his family. To be a patsy is even more tragic than what he ultimately decides to do when he realizes that a ""test of loyalty"" was the reason behind his defection, not willing to bear the emotional toll once he discovers what (doesn't) exist on Narvanna III. A lot of time is spent on the crew trying to determine if Jarok is a Romulan spy or legitimate in his claims. It will take some convincing for Picard to cross over the Neutral Zone and into Romulan space.With Picard watching Data in a Shakespearian play, giving a tutorial on his finding his own performance and understanding the human condition, later requesting his android officer's advice about the crew's spirits, wanting him to ""record"" the events upcoming, is just another set of moments that add such gravitas to the overall episode. Include some thrilling back-and-forth (once again; if their work in ""The Enemy"" wasn't nifty enough, this just puts the icing on the cake) between Katsulas' returning Commander Tomalak and Picard, as the brink of war seems imminent (with a nice use of the Klingons in a little twist), and ""The Defector"" is loaded with drama. Sloyan brings quite a lot of passion and urgency to his part, too. When Sloyan fails, at first and for a while, to give specific details about the invasion, I think he instills Jarok with a sense of loyalty to his people and it is only when Picard doesn't seem willing to just take his word for it that he concedes, for the sake of stopping a potential war. Katsulas gives Tomalak a gleam in his eye, a jovial reception of Picard's presence in his side of the Neutral Zone, and when he talks about using the Enterprise as a symbol of Romulan adulation in its unconditional surrender (or, ""best-case scenario"", destruction of the starship), it is with great sense of pride he makes such a demand. Oh, how sweet it was when Picard unveiled his little surprise to compete with two Romulan warbirds! Again, like other episodes and the series as a whole, Picard will go to battle if he has to (and equips himself not too badly when he must), but it is clear he would prefer to avoid if at all possible.",10

First of all it is very exciting. The Enterprise crew and Danar are playing cat and mouse, with Danar always one step ahead. In this game of tactics many rooms, corridors, Jefferies tubes, the shields and the transporter of the Enterprise are used, as well as a small spaceship and some objects in space. Danar's guerrilla tactics on board the Enterprise remind me of another great episode a few seasons later, namely Starship Mine, where Picard in a way takes over Danar's role.Apart from all the ""Die Hard-like"" action scenes, there is also an interesting idea at the basis of The Hunted. It is about what to do with people after they come home from a war and have been turned into dangerous weapons. What is the responsibility of the government and society when soldiers have been dehumanized by war, military conditioning and technology? It is more or less the message of the first Rambo movie or Full Metal Jacket.",9
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Hunted (TV Episode 1990)",Star Trek The Next Generation--The Hunted,"I think The Hunted is super cool if just because Danar is able to circumvent every tactic and attempt by the Enterprise crew to capture and stop him. Danar has been built by the Angosian race to be the perfect soldier to help their military win a war, then exiled like his fellow killing machine soldiers to a prison settlement on Lunar V. Oh, they are well fed and treated with fine accommodations on the settlement but still deprived of freedoms those of his people have(who weren't genetically, physically, or behaviorally altered for the rigors and expectations of a bloody war). Danar escapes because he's tired of living imprisoned; this sentiment is felt by his like-minded soldiers who want to return home and have freedoms they've been deprived. Data and Troi become sympathetic to Danar when they realize that he's been programmed by scientists and then abandoned by them (or as Picard feels, ""they turned their backs on him"") after their victory of the war. It is then debated as to whether or not the scientists of Angosia can reverse the process and remove the protective impulse to kill when a threat presents itself. The whole start of the episode was Angosia wanting to become part of the United Federation of Planets. Their application process would perhaps be determined successful/unsuccessful upon the away team from the Enterprise seeing the Angosian way of life, their governmental structure, the political structure, so one and so forth. Danar's escape certainly throws a monkey wrench into these plans. Seeing Danar reduce the Enterprise security to fallen bodies and equip himself nicely in a battle with Worf (Worf even comments, in respect to his battling capabilities, that he must have Klingon blood; this was a nice spot), not to mention, move about the ship, creating elaborate means to avoid capture, is just exciting and thrilling to watch for this Trekkie. Danar's scenes with Data and Troi are also noteworthy; the way the actor, Jeff McCarthy, shows the ""duality"" existing within him, the torture of being a non-violent man trapped in a human killing machine, it adds dramatic weight when in conversation with Troi and Data, for we sense his immediate cynicism give way to open revelations on how he is burdened, desiring to be free to live without having to kill when the impulse overtakes him. James Cromwell has an early Trek appearance as the Angosian Prime Minister just wanting the likes of Danar to stay far away from his pacifist society.",9

Interestingly, they soon learn that the man hadn't actually committed crimes but was a soldier who has deliberately been made into this dangerous being. And, instead of trying to deprogram the man, the Angosians simply have banished him and their other soldiers to a penal colony! Like many episodes of ""Star Trek"", this one is obviously intended as a parallel to today. It's obvious that it's intended as a lesson about PTSD and society's need to fix these broken warriors.

Danar is crafty however and escapes. This episode had harrowing similarities to many of the mentally scarred soldiers from the Vietnamese wars. Upon arriving in the Capital City Picard argues with the Prime Minister who has made it clear that the affair is nothing to do with the Federation.

With some difficulty, they do so. Only now they find that the prisoner, a veteran of a previous war, had committed no crimes, and was sent to prison only because he was now considered by the citizens of his home world as now simply being undesirable to be allowed to return to normal society.A particularly great twist in the plot is that, after so many times before we've seen the Prime Directive take a back-seat to the desire of the crew to help other cultures, we now get to see it used to keep the Federation out from interfering with situation that the native government has brought upon itself.And a most deservedly so situation it is!",9

And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword.

The concept is a big one and terrorists, who have been crying out for independence for 75 years, abduct Doctor Crusher. The leader of the Ansata terrorists, Kyril Finn, has no real demands but more a trying to be noticed attitude to the kidnapping. Riker negotiates and hits a dead end at almost every turn. On the Enterprise Data and Picard discuss terrorism and it's success rate. The show was brave enough to even say that Ireland had been reunified due to terrorism! When the Ansata attack the Enterprise they use an interdimensional form of transport and in a flash of brilliance Wesley realizes they could be using a form of travel called folded space travel and a method could be used to detect the energy pattern. The Enterprise has now lost it's Captain and he is being held with Doctor Crusher. Picard's conversation with Beverly is interesting and shows the damage done to the abductee's psyche by their captor. The Enterprise crew eventually find the base and Finn is killed by one of the police from the planet. She makes it clear that his capture would have incited more violence. Now he's a martyr. A good episode showing bullets do not answer all problems. After this being banned for many years in Ireland and England a satellite station showed it with the reunification of Ireland being carefully edited from it. Only recently has a new TV station been brave enough to show it in it's unedited form",10

An away team is enjoying a meal in a restaurant when there is a terrorist attack. An explosion results in several casualties. Unfortunately, Beverly Crusher, who as a doctor feels a moral imperative to help the wounded is captured and brought to the den of the insurgents. This turns into a classic representation of a civil war where there has been murder and mayhem for some time. Beverly is enlisted to attend to the needs of the insurrectionists as they also have casualties. She does her job but will not speak. A young charismatic man named Finn talks to her and tries to convince her to look at the events from two sides. The dominant culture has had a stranglehold on people for as long as he can remember and he is willing to die for his cause. Beverly smugly reminds him that there are other ways to do things and violence is never the way. He reminds her that the universe is scattered with bodies, the result of her own ship's actions, even if they are righteous. Many have compared this to the conflicts in Northern Ireland and it is no coincidence that the leader of the rebel forces is named Finn. A really provocative episode.",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The High Ground (TV Episode 1990)",Its parallel to today is obvious.,"It's obvious that this episode is based on various terrorist organizations of the day--such as the IRA and PLO. This isn't surprising, as all the Star Trek franchises have a history of making episodes with contemporary parallels. In this episode, the Enterprise is visiting the Ruthian planet--a place which has been plagued with terrorist attacks for many, many years. It seems that the Ensatan separatists want their own homeland and they seem willing to do just about anything to bring about this change--including kidnapping Dr. Crusher. But there is another reason for taking her prisoner, as the Ensatans are experiencing serious genetic damage due to their use of dimensional shifting--a practice long abandoned by the Federation since it will eventually kill those who use it. Naturally the Enterprise want the Doctor back but they also don't want to be picking sides or get pulled into the conflict. Unfortunately, the Ensatans don't see it that way and soon are targeting the Enterprise and its crew.Overall this is a decent episode, though some might be offended at the moral relativity. In other words, terrorists and those fighting them in this one are basically the same. This is sometimes true...sometimes not in real life. But its message is compelling nevertheless.",7

The Prime Directive (of non-interference) has proved again, to be just lip-service and of no value at all. (It reminds me of the 3 laws of Robotics, in the sense that they too, could easily be thwarted whenever one wanted.)This episode clearly poses the age old question: When does a terrorist become a freedom fighter and vice versa? The question that perhaps matters more in our present day world, and certainly in the Middle East is: Is there ever any difference between the two? Had the Nazis won the war, then the French Resistance would have been regarded with much less humour than it is now.The episode has an unsatisfying if realistic storyline and end: Picard gets it pointed out to him that he and Starfleet are very MUCH choosing sides, despite the (sideways mentioned) Prime Directive. Finn, the rebel-leader accuses Crusher of double standards: the American Revolution was okay, but the Ansata Revolution isn't? The rebels ask for negotiations under Starfleet guidance. But, the rebel hideout is discovered, Starfleet leaves and the freedom-fighters/rebels are crushed with their leader dead. There is no more need for the Rutians to negotiate with the Ansata. Further oppression is likely to ensue, since more importantly, there is also no need for Starfleet to do anything. And they don't do it, either.Even more bizarrely, in a typical case of life imitating art imitating life, the BBC, ITC, and some Irish broadcaster all censored this episode, because DATA mentioned that in 2024 the Irish had gained their independence by terroristic acts. He wonders why Picards thinks the terrorist are so bad and or mistaken since it has worked in the past. He then lists a number of cases, including the Irish one, which got the episode subsequently banned.

Why exactly is uncertain--all you know is that Q is very whiny and hates the prospect of living out life this way. Although the Q plot is diverting, the crew really must work on stopping the moon from leaving its orbit and destroying the planet, so much of the time Q whines and everyone but Data ignores him. As for Data, his conversations with Q are awfully funny. Bizarrely, despite Q's immense knowledge, no one considers asking him to help save the planet. Still, despite this, Q does manage to save the day! How and why? Well, see the show.This episode has a lot of fun moments and just goes to show you that the humans on the show are pretty dumb and NEVER are the least bit grateful for his help--and he IS quite helpful here despite himself.

It's also a testament to Gene Roddenberry's genius that he recognized his immense talent and cast him in the first couple of episodes as the iconic Q entity.

While the opening establishes that a moon is mysteriously out of orbit and heading for a planet, Picard and crew trying to determine how to alter its path, ""Déjà Q"" is more concerned with Q dealing with ""punishment"" from the Continuum for too many missteps and troublesome misbehavior, opting to be a human mortal after little time to determine another option regarding what type of lifeform he'd prefer. Being a human mortal bums Q out as a race of lifeforms (that exist in the form of a lightning cloud) try to break the shields of the Enterprise to kill him. Twice they almost succeed, the second time Data nearly perishes after stopping the race from snatching Q from the Enterprise. Picard and company have a hard time accepting Q is mortal and not just up to his old tricks. That said, Q faces a crisis when dealing with all the emotions, fatigue, and hunger (and pain; such as when Guinan stabs his hand with a fork!) and the like while ""bonding"" with Data (his only support, as the whole Enterprise is completely against him (and rightfully so), making correct assessments that Q does have a lot to offer in terms of intelligence and his experience as a god) during the difficult transition from immortal to mortal. ""How the mighty have fallen,"" an apt comment from Guinan who understandably basks in the misery plaguing mortal Q. As the series continued, Q become more of a comic act, although most of the episodes he appeared placed the Enterprise crew in difficult situations that often left them worse for wear. Here, Corbin Bernsten (!) shows up as a part of the Q Continuum who was responsible for kicking Q out for his malfeasance, appearing at the nick of time as the race of vengeful lifeforms were closing in on their target (Q gets a conscience and realizes he is a detriment and danger to the Enterprise as long as he remains on board, hitching a ride in a shuttlecraft). The ending is especially fun as Q is returned his powers, appears on the bridge with a mariachi band, granting Riker a couple of ladies on each arm, and gives Data a moment to enjoy the emotion of laughter (brief but still emotion Data had never felt at that time). Q takes care of the moon crisis and Picard wonders if a ""residue"" of humanity remained. The use of lighted cigars was a nicely humorous touch. The chance to see Q vulnerable and weak, unable to get much guidance or support from those around him (his constant harassment of those on the ship hasn't endeared him to them), is unique within the tenure of the show. As usual, De Lancie is a hoot as Q, proving once again how much his character was an asset over the long term with his sporadic (and never boring) encounters (mostly uninvited) with the Enterprise.

The Q Continuum has stripped Q of his powers and left him in a humanoid shell. Q asks for asylum but is instead thrown in the brig. Q must deal with his new corporeal form while also helping Geordi and Data stop the spiralling moon. This becomes more complicated when a race known as the Calimarane show up to seek revenge on the now mortal Q.I have mixed emotions on our old pal Q. Sometimes I find myself hating him as a god-like figure that is a quick fix to any open-ended plot device. Other times I find him charming, his interactions with Picard and Guinan being a real highlight.I do enjoy this episode. Probably not as much as other people based on the rating but I thought it was a good one. It was interesting watching Q grabble with his own mortality. His scenes with Data as they discuss the illogically minded human race make for the best ones of the episode. I could probably do without his back ache and his hunger (your omnipotent Q, you should know what hunger is!).

With Gina Hecht (Manua) and Craig (Kragg) Nelson.This Ep deals with the way each of us perceives ""Truth"" - And the very disparate ways we all see the same events.If two people see an event occur, and questioned about it separately, we would see that the result would be just the same as has happened in this Ep. Each person would insist that the events transpired in the way they perceived it. It takes a rare person, perhaps an Empath like Troi, to be able to put themselves truly in another person's place. Sometimes this happens in real life, but here, we are shown a set of events that change drastically depending on who is telling the tale.After seeing this, I began to sincerely doubt if anyone can really convey a set of circumstances to another person without tainting it toward their benefit.This episode begins with the Teaser of Picard and two others painting a nude woman, to a Ron Jones score that is haunting and Beautiful, music which is played out in Variations throughout the Ep, depending on who is narrating the events which occurred on the Space Station. The Teaser has Data explaining the differences in the way Picard and the two other artists perceived and painted the Nude woman.And so Riker paints his picture of events, as does Manua and Tanya (Juliana Donald) - And the Musical Theme changes according to each of these narrations.The Holodeck is used as a Gimmick, not only does the Holodeck serve to bring the Depositions to ""life"" - It also serves another, physical purpose, which as a Spoiler I will let you the reader of my humble review mull over.On the subject of Plot holes, I'll simply say, and if Riker had fired a phaser during Transport, the Transporter WOULD have given Colm Meany-O'Brien an opportunity to shut it off. Also, O'Brien could have been used as a Witness, to show that indeed, Riker was NOT holding a Phaser as he materialized on the Transporter Pad. As we all saw, Riker was not holding a Phaser at all. The Pacing of the scenes regarding the explosion and Riker's successful beam-out, was handled in such a way as we never gave it a second thought, it was a superb piece of (mis)direction on the part of Cliff Bole.This was a 3rd Season Ep, planted firmly in the center of TNG's best Season and right in the middle of the series run - An Episode Co-Produced by the team of Hans Beimler and Richard Manning - Who always worked together in the early 90's and were responsible for some great Saturday AM Cartoons as well and ST:TNG - Everything they co-produced glowed with their magic touch - and this Ep is one of the best Eps produced during that season of Trek.",

If Riker had fired it at anything/anyone, all one would do is retrieve it and check to see when it was fired, down to the exact stardate. It would correspond pretty much the time the base exploded and Riker was transporting. He'd have a lot to answer for.Now granted this has to be read into it, but everything else a person does is basically chronicled, people are trackable at any time via the ship's computer, and reachable via their communicators. Yet the simple notion of putting a track on a lethal tool doesn't have one.Just doesn't fit at all....",7

The reason is this episode is about how different witnesses to a murder and station explosion see the incident (in the style of Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"") including Riker (who is now a suspect) - and instead of recalling the incident, we are given visual representation of each witnesses' testimonies via the holodeck.Basically, this episode brings to ""perspective"" as to what is the truth - is there an objective truth or is it truly only subjective?",

'A Matter of Perspective' restages TNG as a mock trial with Commander Riker on the hook for attempted murder. What follows is a series of exhibits, cross-examinations and analysis, and that's about as dull as it sounds. There's an almost lighthearted tone in the episode's opening, having Riker loitering on the bridge (totally in the dog house) while everyone else gets down to business; and I do like the scientific use of the holodeck aside from its usual role in endangering the ship.The episode's title is pretty succinct: it's all about changes in perspective.

Before extraditing Riker to the planet for trial, Picard requests an inquest on the holodeck, where the computer programs the scene of the crime. We watch every witness' own take on the events that transpired. But whose telling the truth of what happened?Using the holodeck for this purpose sounded interesting off the bat but I quickly realized it's basically pointless. It's like watching a recreation on a real crime show. It doesn't add anything to the testimonies that you can't read off of a transcript. If anything, it adds an emotional aspect to it when you watch holodeck Riker sexually assault Manual. But these kind of visceral emotions have no place in a trial.Speaking of that scene, we get no conclusion to that little thread. That's odd isn't it? Troi says they're both telling the truth but that doesn't make any sense. Nor is it explained away by memory loss or anything of that nature. Did Riker assault this woman? It's odd that Picard wouldn't want this issue settled. I wouldn't want any doubt to be left in my mind about my first officer.But this episode is pretty slow besides all of this. We watch the same scenes get reenacted multiple times with small tweaks to them. It's fairly boring watch Riker watch himself on the holodeck. The most interesting tidbit to me was how the holodeck accidentally recreated the scientist's experiment and almost blew the Enterprise sky high.One of the season's duller episodes.",4

Poor Riker, trying to take the high ground, finds himself accused of murder. Unfortunately, for him, the scene of the crime has been obliterated, so all the evidence is hearsay. Sadly, the planet which has charged Riker allows this suspect evidence to take someone to trial. The whole thing centers around a surprise visit to a scientist who has been working on some pretty impressive stuff. He is a crotchety guy who has a wife who is obviously unhappy. In Riker's version, she comes on to him after showing him his bedroom and as he pushes her away, the husband comes in. It is certainly embarrassing for all parties. Riker realizes there is no easy solution but agrees the next morning to return to the Enterprise with a report on his findings. The scientist has promised a complaint to Star Fleet. As Will is about to beam up, the space station explodes and kills the researcher. All must be waded through and sorted out. A pretrial investigation convenes on the holodeck.

A European reviewer of one of the previous episodes pinpointed every horrible facial tick that he tries to pass off as acting very well-- everything from a raised eyebrow to express puzzlement to a twitch to express anger. He very rarely seemed to ever BE Riker, and he is a better director than actor (although people who have seen ""Insurrection"" might disagree with even this statement.)

It seems that they think he's just murdered Dr. Apgar. What follows is a ""Rashomon"" style program where three different people give their impressions of what has occurred--followed by the actual chain of events as they occurred.

Specific to Star Trek, there were solid special effects including a lengthy space battle (with the Klingons), the introduction of the Ambassador-class starship (Enterprise-C), and a full-fledged time displacement. Guinan's character was also fleshed out, while at the same time endowed with even more mystery, being the only one to sense the effects of the time displacement. The episode also set up a significant long-term plot line in the series, one that wouldn't be resolved until halfway through the fifth season. There were many memorable lines throughout, most striking being the transition from ""Captain's Log, Stardate"" to ""Military Log, Combat Date"". The only thing I would have changed would have been to have Worf leading the Klingon squadron in the alternate timeline... It would have been fun to hear him say: ""Federation ship: Surrender, and prepare to be boarded.""

So now, instead of Worf, now Tasha Yar (played by Denise Crosby) is back. A very sentimental and emotional episode, this is definitely one of the best if not the best of the TNG episodes.This episode will also have wide repercussions - with the emergence of Sela, Tasha's daughter in the episode ""Redepemption"".Trivia note: Worf is introduced to prune juice, a ""warrior's drink"".

3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Yesterday's Enterprise (TV Episode 1990)",Excellent television,"Star Trek is no stranger to time travel stories (and I have to confess to a certain weariness towards the gimmick, at this point), but with 'Yesterday's Enterprise', they really hit on something special. The technical side of it involves a temporal rift, a Galaxy-class starship from the past, and an alternate universe (not to mention a more battle-oriented Enterprise-D, for which the color blue is very flattering); but it's the human drama that lends this episode its real emotional weight. Should Picard send the travelers back to their own time (and certain death) or keep them alive and hope the war with the Klingons will finally go their way? Mixed up in all of this is Tasha Yar - and I have to say, her presence isn't just a plot device, but an organic way for the writers to make up for her senseless exit in the first season. It just works, and it's really something to see it pulled off so well.This is classic TNG all the way; big ethical issues, well-drawn characters and powerful storytelling; even Shooter McGavin gets to play a pretty solid character.

Whoopi is a great asset to the show and is in it only enough to enhance the show and never to steal any of the limelight! But in this particular episode, credit is due as she gave her best performance of the entire series. The sets and acting by Patrick, showing us a hardened by war Picard were fantastic.

5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Yesterday's Enterprise (TV Episode 1990)",A Reply To toolkien,"I am also one who counts this episode as the absolute best of the entire series. Others have sung its praises, and I do not feel the need to add to them. I only wanted to reply to toolkien's review, which cites an alleged plot hole. Rather than restate his argument, I'll let you go read his review (there aren't that many reviews for this episode, so it should be easy to find).I assert that toolkien's argument holds no water. In fact, we *do* have canonical evidence that you *can't* just send a ship off into combat on autopilot. The *only* time that was ever successfully done was with the M-5 device, in TOS's ""The Ultimate Computer"", and we know that the M-5 experiment was ultimately a failure and no Federation ships since are equipped with one. Lacking one, it can't be done, and I shall prove it.EXHIBIT A: I cite as evidence the third movie ""The Search For Spock"". In that movie, just to have the ship be controlled by a mere handful of people, Scotty has to create an automating device. This alone tells us you can't just go fly the ship somewhere on autopilot-- if you could, they wouldn't have needed Scotty's hack, they would have just set the Enterprise on autopilot and sat back and enjoyed the ride to Genesis. But what's more, Scotty's jury-rigging eventually *breaks down* when faced with the challenge of combat. This makes it extra-clear that combat is too hard to be auto-piloted.EXHIBIT B: I cite the TOS episode ""This Side Of Paradise"". At one point in this episode, the entire crew has mutinied and abandoned the ship, choosing instead to beam down to a paradise-like planet. Kirk is left alone on the ship, everyone else is gone. And here is his *exact quote*, from his captain's log: ""The ship... can be maintained in orbit for several months, but even with automatic controls, I cannot pilot her alone. In effect, I am marooned here."" So where's your autopilot now?In short, there is hard evidence that a starship cannot be auto-piloted, especially in combat, and I am aware of *no* evidence which suggests it can (again, except for the M-5). But even if we speculate that by Enterprise C's time, they had developed *some* ability to autopilot, there's every good reason to posit that it might not be very good, especially at combat. Keep in mind: the *whole point* is to convince the Klingons that the Federations acted honorably. If the ship went back with no crew, just on autopilot, it is reasonable to think that the Klingons would not have been impressed by the half-assed effort that the automation system might have been able to produce. Indeed, it might well have been Yar's tactical expertise *itself* which pushed them over the line enough to win the Klingons' respect. We don't really know for sure, but if the episode wants to lean in that direction, it's on sturdy enough ground that you can't label that a plot hole.",10
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Yesterday's Enterprise (TV Episode 1990)",Excellent Use of the Concept of Rips in Time,"This is the ultimate decision for Picard. When another Enterprise shows up through some time fabric rip just as it is about to be destroyed by the Romulans, it becomes a problem because unless it is destroyed, it may change the circumstances of the universe. Of course, that means that an entire crew and starship needs to be given up in order to maintain a sense of order. What does one do morally? Is the loss of human life necessary? Are we to keep score when it comes to how many for how many? Casualties are often thrown out as negative statistics and people cheer. The people that die or are maimed do not cheer. Tasha Yar makes an appearance her, the first time after her death, and that death becomes a pivotal event in the decision making. Her relationship with a survivor and the captain of the Enterprise C are the link. This is true science fiction with some amazing ideas about time and the purpose of living beings as they explore the universe. Excellent in every way, though, the results may not be totally fulfilling.",10

The writer's fascination with Wesley Crusher kept me from becoming a fan originally. How a snot nosed kid could continually save the day just meant sloppy writing for me. But I digress.I finally decided to watch the whole TNG saga. I noticed at the beginning in Series 3 things were looking up. Tonight, I finally watched episode 15, Yesterday's Enterprise. I had heard nothing about it and my expectations were middling. Imagine my surprise when I was greeted with stunning speculative Science Fiction of the first rank, seriously challenging anything in the Original Series.From a sweet script and chilling drama to great ensemble acting, I was blown away. A previous iteration of the Enterprise suddenly appears 22 years after it was supposedly destroyed and instantly changes the Star Trek universe.

The Enterprise rescues the Enterprise C (thrown 20 years into the future) and mends the ship and its crew. Yar starts to fall for one of the ship's officers.Guinan convinces Picard that this timeline isn't right and that they must send the Enterprise C back through the wormhole to its own time, even if that means their demise. Them being their to aide the Klingons in their fight against the Romulans might be enough to band the two sides together in a pact that holds. The Federation is in a losing battle against the Klingons and can't hold out much longer. The C crew agrees to head back. By this point Yar has figured out she should be dead in the original timeline (through talking to Guinan) and heads with the Enterprise C to battle the Romulans 20 years prior. The timeline snaps back to normal and the crew of the Enterprise D travel on none of the wiser to what the audience just witnessed.This episode is a fan favorite (and with good reason). It's one of the more exciting time travel episodes and it reintroduces Tasha Yar after her untimely demise two seasons ago. The acting is good, the pacing is good, the action is exciting.But all that being said, I don't love this episode as much as your average Trekkie. The love subplot between Yar and Shooter McGavin seems tossed on haphazardly to me. I don't buy it and I don't need it. It's inclusion adds zero value to the plot itself.That's really my main gripe with the episode. If it only took up a minute or two it wouldn't bother me so much but it is a major chunk of this episode! Replace that with some other scenes and this is a 10/10 for me.I'm also thankful the writers didn't try to shoehorn Worf into this somehow. I'm glad they resisted the urge to make him the captain of some Klingon ship that shows up. That would have been real dumb.My favorite part of this though is how much Guinan we get. Every episode I see makes me love Whoppi's character a little more.",8

There have been precedents of this happening in past episodes, In the original series, ""The Cage,"" the reason Capt Pike investigates a planet is because they find a ships recorder floating in space. In other episodes, Capt Kirk has copies of the ships log jettisoned when he felt they were soon to be destroyed. In this scenario, since both Enterprises' know that the future in which they came to meet was not supposed to take place, either one of them could have left a record of their existence in THAT reality. This would have come in especially handy since in future episodes Capt pichard is confronted by someone who is a direct result of that momentary confluence of the two time periods from this episode.",

Only Guinan realizes that everything has changed on board the current ship. The once friendly Klingons have reverted back to being enemies. As the older Enterprise crew tries to deal with being in the future and the current crew tries to determine the impact of the past people living in the present, it brings to mind the season ending episode of Season 1 and the episode where Picard sees a duplicate of himself in the ""Times Squared"" episode and also seems to presage on the series finale episode as well. Picard has the same dilemma involving whether to return things back to where they should be or if doing that would be the wrong decision. Evenutally, he decides to send the doomed earlier Enterprise back to its own time period. In this episode, Tasha Yar returns and Riker is killed.",9

I remember watching sporadically latet season episodes. Now it is on Netflix I have been watching these early episodes for the first time.
I didn't particularly like Tasha Yar, I never knew she existed till recently and am only a casual fan. Her death in series 1 didn't bother me. Just watched 'Yesterdays Enterprise'. Jesus it hit me right in the feels. Not ashamed to say I was on the verge of tears when Yar requested a transfer from Picard and for the rest of the episode. This episode was fantastic story telling.

If they knew all these people would have died, but have been bounced to the future, and they surmise that the ship will likely be destroyed shortly, why not just send it back WITHOUT THE CREW, set to execute basic instructions then self destruct? The Klingons will be friends again and no one has to die. But then we'd wouldn't have a whole lot of tension then would we? The fact they don't even discuss it is a huge plot hole. Of course it set up other interesting avenues for the series to eventually go down, so it works out for the best. As someone else said it would have been nice to see Worf as an enemy Klingon and perhaps even another character that would be seen as having been an ongoing character in that time line that we didn't even know and know we wouldn't see again (somewhat of a counterweight that this time line has a certain legitimacy of its own).",7
16,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Yesterday's Enterprise (TV Episode 1990)",assign registry..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 03Upgrading to a better result than the previous season, this one installs the additional morale lessons among all new innovative ideas that are also brimmed with fresh perspective and incredibly productive methods.Yesterday's EnterpriseThis episode is the most Star Trek-y you could ask for, with a huge pew-pew spaceship battle, a major sacrifice for the greater good, a fixation of a malfunction in the last moment for a close call and of course a good old time travel debate; drool over it all you wish to, this is the best served dished.",
17,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Yesterday's Enterprise (TV Episode 1990)",This episode helps to establish the completely inexplicable return of Tasha Yar.,"At about the end of the first season, Denise Crosby requested she be written off the show, as her part was VERY limited. I would certainly agree, as her role consisted of saying ""yes, Captain"", being angry or talking about the rape gangs on her home planet. Otherwise, she was a non-entity. Now, for some odd reason, she's back. I have no idea whose idea it was, but following this return, she'd be back for future episodes as well--something which never worked for me. The Enterprise inexplicably meets a previous version of the Enterprise in space. Somehow, the old version C was transported 22 years in the future. But this isn't the only change, as apparently this time shift also completely changed the timeline--resulting in Lt. Yar being alive and well on the Enterprise D as well as a long and super-bloody war between the Klingons. 40,000,000,000 lives have been lost in this horrific fight and it's lasted since about the time the Enterprise C disappeared. In fact, they eventually come to realize that if they can send that ship back, then the timeline will change and perhaps the war will never occur at all. Oddly, Guinan realizes that there is a problem and the old Enterprise must go back--but many of the other crew members want the ship to stay and help in the hopeless fight against the Klingons.While the episode is a very interesting what if sort of show, it also re- introduces Yar. She's actually fine here--but her eventual return as a Romulan (?!) made no sense at all and seemed contrived as well as a low- point for the series. I just wish in hindsight that they'd given Ms. Crosby better material from the start, as this weird, abortive return just felt strange and a bit silly.",6

He talks about how the ship can go anywhere and even states that there power is unlimited. ""the power is re-generative"" or whatever... So, the old Enterprise 1701 could cruise the cosmos forever, but Voyager, etc. has to run out of fuel? I think they explain it by that to go over Warp 8 or 9 or something, you have to use a different type of fuel-system, so maybe the old Enterprise could go forever, but it could never be as fast... except when it goes Warp 11 (By Any Other Name) and when the Enterprise D goes Warp 13 (Finale).",10

In this episode, you see Data creating another android like himself - an android that takes the shape of a female, his ""daughter"", named Lal (which means beloved).Soon, when Starfleet wants to take Lal away from Data because they feel they can ""raise"" her better than Data, Picard comes to his rescue arguing that Data is her father and can raise her better. He even brings up how he helped define the rights and privileges for androids in ""The Measure Of A Man"" and that Lal has the right to make her own choices.Soon though, it turns out that she outperforms Data - by looking more human, using contractions - but all good things must come to an end.Trivia note: Data does a neural transfer of his positronic brain into Lal (just like he would into B4 in Star Trek: Nemesis). Also, you see the Original Series aliens called the Andorians as a Holodeck recreation.And, also, Picard for the first time in the series, goes against an admiral's orders (just like he would in force in Star Trek: Insurrection).",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Offspring (TV Episode 1990)",Can androids have offspring?,"This episode expands the show's primary theme of exploring what comprises being human, in this case, parenting. Other reviews have summarized the plot well. This was an ostensibly simple, but very emotionally powerful, episode that elicited universal emotions, since we all come from parents. The most poignant scene for me was near the end when Lol thanked her ""father"", Data, for giving her life. With one of my own parents, my mom, currently in the final stages of her life, this story was a good reminder that for all their faults and imperfections, parents virtually always mean well in bringing us into the world and giving us the gift of life, and that even their selfish hopes and dreams for us have a certain nobility. Great writing, and acting by all the cast, especially Brent Spiner as Data, and the actress playing Lol. Piccard's evolution on the situation was interesting, and his decision to disobey a direct order from a superior was consistent with the moral integrity his character is noted for. Editing could have been a bit tighter, but really I may be reaching, as this episode is nearly perfect in it's loving portrayal of humanity at it's best, ironically told in this allegory about an android and his offspring.",9
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Offspring (TV Episode 1990)",This is the Episode That Made Me a Star Trek Fan,"A little back story: Through my teens I was an ardent fan of films and sci-fi (primarily Star Wars), and Star Trek always piqued my interest, but I was too intimidated to invest the time to acquaint myself with a franchise that stretched over television and film since the 1960s.That being said, I came across this episode while scanning TV channels and was immediately drawn to the character of Data, an singular android who dedicates his improbable existence to evolve and grow in order to be more ""human."" His quest in this episode included creating a new android in the hopes of improving upon his own limitations through his designated ""offspring"" (as most true parents do), including having this android eventually find a way to develop authentic emotional reactions.However, when Starfleet grows impatient with the development of Data's new android, they threaten to confiscate it, instigating a surprisingly emotional struggle over the philosophy of sentient rights and acceptance that ultimately becomes overshadowed in the face of tragedy. It's all the more astonishing to consider the most emotionally devastating moments of the episode feature characters who can't project any emotions at all.Brilliantly written, performed, and directed, this is one of the finest hours of television that succeeded in appealing to an outsider of the franchise and making them a fan for life.",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Offspring (TV Episode 1990)",Beautiful Episode of Giving and Losing Life,"Data explores his humanity by an act of creation, 'birthing' a new android life form, with intelligence and freewill like himself. I cannot improve upon the the comments of the main reviewer, but wanted to say this episode is a must see. It deals with the issues of giving life or becoming a parent, raising a child, and coming to terms with that child growing up, becoming independent, and ultimately, the loss of that child. The emotions of the crew serve to represent our human emotions felt in sympathy to Data's loss. A beautiful, emotional episode that I love.I would recommend this episode to anyone who is not yet convinced that Star Trek, and SF in general, has come of age, and can deal with human topics in a touching and full way.",10
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Offspring (TV Episode 1990)",Star Trek The Next Generation--The Offspring,"Magnificent, emotionally rich episode of Star Trek The Generation (further re-iterating just how superb the third season was in producing one special episode after another, this one coming after ""Yesterday's Enterprise"") has Data actually creating a sentient being after attending a cybernetics conference, and, in essence, becoming a father. The android chooses a female human as its ""look"" and ""The Offspring"" follows her transition and awareness of human behavior, even eventually transcending Data's own programming (using contraction ""haven't"" and actually feeling fear). Admiral Haftel (Nicolas Foster) and Starfleet feel Lal (Hallie Todd) would be better served on a starbase in a proper environment to be the object of research and equip ""her"" with all the tools needed to further advance her ""life"" and development. But Data, observing and studying parental behavior and cultural norms regarding raising children, considers Haftel's position as removing a child from her father before the proper time (interfering with her maturation process). That is what drives the whole story: what is best for Lal and should she be taken away from her father so soon? Actually, the question Picard soon offers is ""What does Lal want?"" Lal is a free sentient being (Data's consideration as a free, sentient being in ""Measure of a Man"" determined he was) and should be treated as such. The conclusion when Lal suffers a malfunction as she starts to experience ""cascade failure"" is akin to a father losing his daughter and I'll tell you unashamedly that I was shedding tears. Just heartbreaking. A great moment for Foster (I assume many will kind of have contempt for his way of bullying past the desires of the likes of what Data and Picard believe is the right thing to do in favor of what he thinks is best for Lal) has him describing how hard Data tried to save Lal to Troi, Wesley, and Geordi, and you can sense the anguish and sadness from every pore (I think he properly conveys how a father feels when trying to save his daughter and not being able to do so despite the best efforts). Picard willing to put his career on the line, telling Data not to obey Haftel's orders to tell Lal she's coming with him to the starbase, is quite a crowd-pleaser worthy of applause because it is not only quite a stand for his officer's rights as a father, but also in favor of Lal's independence and rights. Guinan is once again utilized well as a form of guidance for Lal in the terms of learning love, affection, and other human behaviors and actions. Riker (Frakes is not seen much mainly because he directed the episode) has a hilarious moment where he is the ""victim"" of a kiss from Lal, jerking him over the Ten Forward bar (she had seen a couple kissing and was curious)! How Data involves Troi, Beverly (she has this nice moment with Data when he seeks her advice because of her success as a mother) and Wesley is important in how he tries to learn how to properly raise Lal. Parenting is the theme of this episode and under the guise of science fiction, ""The Offspring"" has a lot to share. As a parent, this episode hit an emotional button that resonates.",10
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Offspring (TV Episode 1990)",More proof that Frakes is a better director than actor,"Despite a lot of this episode's themes' inherent creepiness, it is is definitely one of my favorites. It has a great story, great acting (as episodes in which Brent Spiner and Patrick Stewart are handling the bulk of the acting usually do), and solid directing from Frakes, who is much better off behind the camera instead of in front of it. Yet another bullish Starfleet admiral makes for a great antagonist, and yet another good actor portrayed him. There are also deep philosophical questions about AI that we are facing NOW and in our near future that even Next Generation's cast and crew could not have possibly foreseen happening so quickly when they made this episode in 1990.",9
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Offspring (TV Episode 1990)",Another Jackass Starfleet Leader,"Data begins to realize his expertise and knowledge of positronics. After attending an educational session, he decides he needs a project. What he does is build an android to specifications based on his own being. At first it is kind of an amorphous thing that talks and absorbs information. Data, through his constant investigation of things human, believes that he needs to propagate his species, to leave a child in case he were to be killed or destroyed. He chooses a female designation and names her Lal. It is funny watching this fully grown being gaining information, childlike in her actions. She is a source of amusement for others on the crew, but she persists and Data considers her a daughter, although he can't really know love or affection. Picard is angry at first because he wasn't consulted and knows that Starfleet will not look kindly on this. This proves to be the case as an Admiral tells Picard that Lal is to be taken to a facility to be altered and made even more complex. It has already been determined that Androids have the same rights as the other indigenous species and Data refuses to give his permission to have Lal removed. The remainder of the episode has to do with a budding emotionalism and the clash between Picard and the Admiral. A very touching episode.",9
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Offspring (TV Episode 1990)",A daughter for Data,"When Data summons his friends to his lab they are rather surprised with what he has to show them; an android similar to himself although this one is at the time genderless and less well formed. We soon learn that this is because he wishes to let it decide its owns sex and appearance. The android, named Lal, selects the appearance of a female human and when the final modifications are made looks far more human than Data. Data considers Lal to be his daughter and sets about teaching her about human behaviour, school is a problem as she is too clever to be in the junior classes but not socially away enough for the senior classes. School might not have worked but she learns more about human behaviour by helping Guinan in the bar, although there is an amusing misunderstanding along the way involving Commander Riker. There is a problem though, when Star Fleet hear about Lal they insist that she is taken to a research station away from Data, something the captain is willing to make a stand against as he believes Star Fleet has no right to take a child from its parent... sadly before the situation can be resolves Lal begins to fail and Data must struggle to save her.This is a superior episode which has a genuine tear jerker ending made sadder by the fact that Data can't feel emotions yet his dying child can. Brent Spiner was good in his role as Data and Hallie Todd was delightful as his doomed child Lal.",9
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Offspring (TV Episode 1990)",Absolutely wonderful,"Data surprises everyone by creating an android ""daughter"". What's so wonderful about this episode is many things, foremost the excellent performances by Data (Brent Spiner) and Lal (Hallie Todd), interesting philosophical and ethical issues brought up in the episode, as well as excellent dialog between the characters.The ending is also very, very touching. Perhaps one of the most tender moments in Star Trek history.At the heart of the story is one of the main concepts that Star Trek has always conveyed: that certain rights are universal, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, nationality, etc. Star Trek just adds a few new dimensions we do not have to deal with: unusual alien sexualities, inter-species relationships, inter-planetary issues, and with Lt. Cmdr Data, the rights of sentient artificial life-forms.What I thought made this episode so superlative is the conversation that Captain Picard had early on with Data. Picard is chewing Data out for creating another life-form without first consulting him when Data points out that other crew members do not consult Captain Picard with their plans to procreate.Captain Picard's reaction is a typical one of someone being faced with something he doesn't want to deal with and doesn't understand and he reacts accordingly. However, over time, Captain Picard learns that he in fact is wrong about his judgment of the situation. This journey from ignorance to enlightenment is exactly how an educated, thoughtful person can evolve their positions when more facts are discovered.It helps that Data is absolutely objective since he has no emotions. Captain Picard cannot argue with Data because Data always argues from facts and logic.In the trivia section, there is mention that Guinan changed a line of dialog describing human affection as between a man and a woman to between two individuals. This obviously ties in nicely with something that wasn't as much of a national issue in the US back in 1989 but is a big issue today, namely gay marriage and gay rights. There is a nice parallel here with Data and Lal and same-sex couples. Someone like the Admiral who wants to take Lal away for study simply cannot imagine a parental bond between the two. This is similar to those who simply cannot imagine a bond between a same-sex couple today and don't wish them to have the same rights as opposite-sex couples. The hope is that more and more people will be like Captain Picard and evolve their positions over time. Evidence shows that is happening.",10
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Offspring (TV Episode 1990)",Change 2 things and it becomes the best ST episode,"You will read the title and shout ""Blasphemy!"" but I'm dead serious. This could have been the best episode of TNG, maybe even Star Trek. I know The Inner Light, Duet, Waltz, City on the Edge and Far Beyond the Stars are better contenders but this could have been the one.GOOD STUFF Spiner is so good in this episode he outperforms Stewart, whose defence of Data is fantastic (in fact, out of all AI and robots in all scifi I feel Data/Spiner is the best portrayed). Spiner has the impossible task of playing a man who desperately wants to love his daughter but simply can't, and does so beautifully. The viewer wants him to show emotions but must accept that it's impossible, which makes us like Data even more. Lal is sweet; Guinan has some great scenes. THINGS I DESPISE 1)I hate Starfleet and the Federation. Sounds weird but every single time we are reminded that both are open minded liberal institutions that are friendly, not racist or sexist, kind to other cultures and respectful of rights. And every episode in every ST proves the exact opposite. Q is quite right in his criticisms, as is Quark. Just think of all the time officers are racist toward the Ferengi, Klingons, Cardassians, Romulans, even Vulcans. Whenever a species is on the verge of warp flight they make contact, which must be utterly overwhelming, and offer membership. When any other race does this they are enraged, calling it conquering and annexing. 2)I hate TNG's need to end shows with happiness. If there was ever any episode that needed a camera panning to Troi in tears it was this one, but it's the usual techno-babble solution and let's warp outta here.CHANGE THIS 1)Boot the admiral. Starfleet is outraged that a loyal, sentient, fully righted officer dares to have a child and sends the worst admiral they can find to show how arrogant and criminal they are. They accept Data's rights and want to steal his child for no reason, an act of utter barbarity. The hypocrisy is so enraging here. Data himself asks whether any other officer asks permission before reproducing and he's absolutely right. Even the IMDb synopsis poses ""Data creates an offspring without regards to the ramifications for Star Fleet"". Total BS. Starfleet has neither to fear ramifications nor feel the need to meddle. Again, a loyal officer has a child: Oh no!!! Let's ignore both their rights and confiscate the child.2)The ending sucks and the worst part is they had the perfect ending in another episode. Change the ending of ""The Offspring"" and ""In Theory""; it would have been unbelievably strong and telling if Data had deleted the program because it was flawed, sit there alone in standby mode, and be glad to see Spot. He's not a dick for liking Spot as much as Lal, but that is the full extent of his love for anyone. It would have been such a deep ending, again forcing the viewer to accept Data's limitations.WHAT TO DO WITH THE FREED TIME (sans admiral) Include a scene with Troi in which Data talks about his need to love her and his inability to do so; have him talk with LaForge about his achievement, how proud Soong would have been, how much it means to him to no longer be alone.Conclusion A fine TNG episode with brilliant work from Spiner and Stewart (TNG's two finest actors); more depth to TNG's most beloved character; Starfleet as annoying as ever; the ending as annoying as ever. ""I will feel it for both of us"" one of the best lines by a guest actor. A wonderful episode that could have been the best.8/10 but it could have been a solid 10/10.",8
10,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Offspring (TV Episode 1990)",Here's to all the heroic dads out there,"One of my favorite Star Trek Next Gen episodes is 'The Offspring', where Data creates a child (named ""Lal""). I first saw it when I was a twentysomething with no wife or kids. I watched it again as a family man, and I had a very different perspective on it, now that I have daughters of my own.When I first watched it, I never understood the closing scene following the death of his child, where Data comes onto the bridge. Picard expresses the crew's condolences, and then Data sits down at his station, expressionless, and does his job. They played this triumphant fanfare as he sat down, and I didn't get why.I get it now: Even when his world is falling apart, the dad still has to go to work, put on a face, and do his job. The music was celebrating this small act of heroism. The irony is that Data, who tries so hard to be human, but never quite succeeds, showed that he could do this better than any human could.",10
11,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Offspring (TV Episode 1990)","Data procreates, Picard defends Data's family from Starfleet Research","Stop what you're doing and spend less than an hour on Netflix to appreciate some of the finest Sci-Fi ever in Star Trek: The Next Generation Season 3 Episode 16 (S3:E16) ""The Offspring"", an episode rated 8.5/10 on IMDb.com. Gene Roddenberry's health was declining during Season 3, and this amazing episode was the first directed by a cast member, Jonathan Frakes (Commander William Riker, 1st officer, aka ""Number One"".)Commander Data, so well played by Brent Spiner, procreates after returning from a conference. Data's daughter Lai was artfully and convincingly played by Hallie Todd. Lai was created covertly in a lab by Data, which at first upsets Picard as he would have preferred to have been consulted first. Data had Lai choose her race and gender among several thousand samples he prepared in the Holodeck. She chooses the form of a human female. In a period of only a few days Data downloads his entire 'positronic network' to his human looking daughter. Data reads every book on parenting, literally thousands, but needs to seek advice from Guinian (Whoopi Goldberg), Counsellor Deana Troi (Marina Sirtis), and Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden). Lai was not adjusting to human school with young school children. As an adult human female, the children laughed at her because they felt intimidated.Wisely Counsellor Troi suggests to Data that Lai could learn human interactions if she worked in the 'Ten Forward' bar under Guinian's supervision. Unlike Data, Lai had achieved one of the 'holy grails' of AI, emotion. Unlike her father Data, Lai spoke using contractions, a less significant accomplishment.Captain Picard appropriately hits high notes of contained anger in several scenes while defending Data's daughter Lai from being taken away for study by Admiral Anthon Haftel (Nicolas Coaster) from 'Starfleet Research'. Coaster's portrayal of the power-hungry Startfleet Research admiral was very convincing. Picard points out that sentient life forms, including android, have rights in the Starfleet charter and that he helped define those rights. He says the admiral's demand that Data turn his young daughter over to Starfleet Research won't happen with Picard as his commanding officer. The stand-off between Captain Picard and the power-hungry Starfleet Research Admiral Haftel is intense. The stand-off is diffused when Lai learns that the admiral is going to separate her from her father (Data) and she feels intense fear which manifests as organic, not programmed in. Lai is confused, and repeatedly taps her stomach in front of Counselor Troi saying 'it hurts'. She wanders back to Data's quarters as she was programmed when experiencing a malfunction. Despite valiant attempts by Data to save her, with the admiral assisting, she dies as her positronic brain suffers a 'cascading failure' triggered by the experience of intense fear, but not before a very touching scene (like none other I've seen in Sci-Fi except in Blade Runner) in which Data informs Lai she is not going to make it, and she says, ""Father, I love you."" When Data responds, ""I'm sorry I cannot feel that with you"", Lai responds, ""I'll feel it for both of us.""Where do I start? First, as Data is an android, when he procreates, the ethical issues raised are profound. The character of Captain Picard has impeccable ethics and he defends Data and his daughter's rights like he would any of his crew members. Since Picard had been involved in getting android's rights in the Starfleet Charter, Picard's unwavering defense of Data and Lai's rights is reminiscent of what one would expect from a father defending his own family.Second, this is the first time I've seen the depiction of PTSD in an android. Lai could not handle the fear of separation from her dad, and she died from it. It reminds me of the aboriginal children taken in the 'sixties scoop' and 'Residential Schools'. Forcibly separating aboriginal children from the families to make them 'White-raised' was unethical, created great distress, emotional harm, and PTSD in the children and inter-generational trauma we see today. In this TNG episode Gene Roddenbury portrayed sentient being rights abuse in an otherwise close-to-utopian future. Kudos to Jonathan Frakes (Cmdr. William Riker) for directing this excellent episode, again the first TNG (or any Trek TV Series) directed by a cast member. Roddenbury did humanity a favour in creating Star Trek, from its original series through The Next Generation, Voyager, Deep Space Nine, and the numerous movies. The humanity themes he highlights, often through metaphor like in this episode, make the world a better place.",9

Now, to make his life more human, Data has decided to have a child! Of course he cannot procreate in the traditional sense, so he builds an android child! And, since it's an android, he allows it to choose its own gender and appearance. While this girl, Lal, looks more human than Data, she turns out to be amazingly slow compared to her 'father'. She cannot pick up on social queues as well, is clumsy and seems, at times, kind of stupid. Because of this, a bigoted Admiral is now pushing to have Lal raised by someone other than Data--and to be raised apart from Data. The WHY of this never really makes any sense--especially in light of an earlier episode which established Data's legal status as a sentient being. And, it makes little sense in light of the Federation's supposed attitude of tolerance and niceness--and this explains why I dropped the score just a bit.As I mentioned above, in some ways this show is a bit like the story of Frankenstein--with Data creating a being like the doctor. However, unlike the irresponsible doctor, Data tries very hard to be a good father and not abandon her to some Federation jerk. Overall, this is a very good episode...and one that might surprise you with how sadly it ends. You might just want to have a box of Kleenex handy.",7

But when Star Fleet gets wind of this new lifeform, the head of R&D shows up wanting to take Lal away for their own purposes.While this is a well made episode, I find a lot of this to be a boring rehash of ""The Measure of a Man"" which covered this ground better. The slight difference is the inclusion of Data as a father figure instead of the focal point of the issue. Star Fleet arguing to take Lal away really doesn't make sense due to the precedent set by Data's court case. How and why this is even an argument is a bit puzzling.But this is a bit of a curio just because it is the first time we get Frakes behind the camera.

0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Sins of the Father (TV Episode 1990)",Trivia,"The initial screenplay did not contain the character Kurn, who was added later as a compromise. The original script had the Enterprise being lured to an ambush by three Klingon ships loyal to Duras. The idea for the script came from the fact that Star Trek archivist, Richard Arnold, was a descendant of Benedict Arnold. Richard Arnold had told me that while Benedict Arnold became a general in the British Army, his sons were never allow to join for the simple reason that their father was a known traitor and it was feared they would be also. ""Sins..."" was the first script to take place (in part) on the Klingon's home-world, Klinga. It is also the only episode of any of the various Star Trek series to win an Emmy and was one of Ron D.

Also, the Age of Ascension is mentioned again (by Kurn).",
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Sins of the Father (TV Episode 1990)",Commander Kurn,"It was in this shows Third Season that it really drew my attention. The first two were good, but character development really began to happen in this one. Worf was always a good character, but was a little too in the background for most episodes. This one gave him some real meat to chew.A Klingon is assigned on the officer exchange program and is later revealed to be Worf's younger brother. He reveals his reason for being there and Worf listens in earnest as Kurn reveals their father has been accused of treason and the show really picks up there. Picard stands by Worf and accompanies him to the Klingon Empire to defend his family name in one of the most interesting Klingon oriented shows of the entire series. A fascinating insight into how the Klingon judicial system works too. Picard's decision to stand by Worf and how the crew banded together was very reminiscent of Star Trek III the Search For Spock in the way the crew stuck together. Casting for this was brilliant also. Tony Todd was wonderful as Kurn and Charles Cooper, Patrick Masset and Thelma Lee were all excellent in their respective roles. This story was later continued through the Fourth Season and into Season Five",10

In this case, the Klingon, Kurn, is now acting commander. Kurn is very strict and disliked by the crew but things are worst for Worf, as Kurn is extremely nice to him--an obvious insult to a Klingon! Eventually, Worf has had enough and he's ready to rip Kurn's head off--at which point you learn that Kurn was testing him to see if he was indeed a Klingon in spirit. This is because Kurn is actually Worf's brother--and the pair have a huge task ahead of them. It seems that their father was recently blamed for the attack, long ago, on Kitimer and it's up to the family honor for the pair to go before the Klingon High Council and restore his honor...or die trying.I really enjoyed this episode because it gave wonderful insights into just how dishonorable and dysfunctional the Klingons could be. Their inflated sense of honor is actually just a ruse and Worf's love of everything Klingon is certainly put to the test. Additionally, it was very nice to see Picard act at Worf's second--a very touching scene. Overall, while this plot unfolds very slowly over several episodes, it is exceptional and among the better stories in season three.",9

Then one day Worf goes to see him in his ready room and finds out that this man is really his brother and he is there to report a really significant bit of information to Worf. Worf's father, who died in a battle against the Romulans, is seen as a traitor on Klingon. It has been decided by the supreme council that he gave the Romulans information that led to the deaths of thousands of Klingons. As is usually the case with this race, Worf must go to the planet and challenge the accusation. If he can't prove it, he will pay with his life.

Second maybe to ""Pilot"", but it feels like every single TV show has an episode with this name; a total cliché. Add to that my lack of favor with Worf, and this episode didn't have me overexcited. But I absolutely underestimated it because it's another high point for this season.We learn so much here, whether it's Klingon law or Worf's heritage. Not only does he discover a sibling, but the integrity of his very bloodline rests at the mercy of a kangaroo court. In the end, good prevails, but at a high cost. And even though it's Worf's story, it's Patrick Stewart who owns this. His intensity is perfect, and Picard's moments with Worf really underlines the bond between a captain and his crewman.It's great drama.8/10",8

This time it's a Klingon coming aboard as acting first officer. There's a big culture clash between the Star Fleet crew and this new arrival. Surprisingly the most animosity is between this new Klingon Kurn and Worf. But it is soon revealed to Worf and the audience that this has all been a test and Kurn is Worf's little brother. Their father has been recently disgraced by the Klingon high council and blamed for the slaughter that killed Worf's parents. The two Klingons dad is now labeled as a traitor. Worf must go to Qo'noS and clear his father's name at any cost.This has been the best Worf-centric episode we've received thus far. He's a Klingon with a bit of an optimistic view on Klingon culture (as he's mostly viewed it from afar) and this episode changes that a bit. He realizes that honor only matters when it's convenient. Here his brother and him are up against the upper class who are able to dictate the narrative of past history.Even so, Worf sacrifices himself for the Empire. With his excommunication, Worf is no longer welcome here. The final scene of all the Klingons ceremonially turning their back on our favorite security officer is absolutely brutual and one of the most powerful scenes in the show's history.",9

Instead of getting rest, he gets hooked up with bad girl Vash, who is one of those people who sparkle with joy, but are incredibly dangerous. She is sort of an Indiana Jones in space and can't stay out of trouble. Picard is immediately attracted to her and they become allies in some intrigue over an artifact, a weapon that is the stuff of mythology. She has ticked off a Ferengi, cheating him out of a lot of money. The neat thing about this episode is the parrying and thrusting of the two characters. Both are formidable and anticipate the moves of the other. If this were not Star Trek, they would make a neat kind of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, using deception and betrayal to get what they want. Now, where exactly is that planet?",8
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Captain's Holiday (TV Episode 1990)",Vash and Picard light up the screen together,"Picard is being crabby so the crew convinces him to take a vacation on Risa. He encounters a female Indiana Jones and they go on a treasure hunt for a powerful artifact that was brought back from the future.This is a great episode that manages to stand out even in a season full of great episodes. Patrick Stewert is phenomenal here, first as the grumpy, stressed-out Captain, then as the reluctant vacationer who just wants to be left alone, and the finally as the adventurous archaeologist who finds the treasure, out-foxes the fox, and saves the day. It's hard to imagine an actor with a performance to match Stewert's here, but Jennifer Hetrick manages do exactly that with her portrayal of Vash, and the chemistry between Picard and Vash is incredible. Vash is a treasure hunter, an archaeologist, and a con artist all wrapped in one. She beats Ferengi at their own game, matches wits with Picard, and has no issue hiking over 20 kilometers through the jungle. And her chemistry and charm is bewitching. Her smile, the way her eyes flash with mischievous life, and the fact that she is so confident and sure of what she wants and isn't afraid to do whatever she needs to in order to get it all make her a desirable woman, even for the reluctant Picard. Quite frankly, she's the only woman who has ever hoped to match Picard's presence or hold his interest. It helps that she is very attractive, too.The time-traveling Vorgons are an interesting inclusion to the story. I think that the writers of the episode intended us to take the ending at face value, but it's vague enough that I am left wondering what their true intentions were all along. They seem almost satisfied at the end when Picard destroys the Uthat. Maybe they were really sent back to prevent the Uthat from falling into the wrong hands, as they initially claimed, and the fact that Picard destroyed it was good enough for them. If the ending was supposed to definitively imply that the Vorgons were thieves trying to steal the Uthat and were foiled by Picard, then the writers did a bad job of making that clear. I prefer to think it was left vague on purpose.This episode also features Max Grodenchik as the Ferengi Sovak. He would later go on to play Rom on DS9. His mannerisms as Sovak are very similar to Rom's (including that awkward bent-over shuffling walk), but Sovak is much more of a traditional Ferengi, being quite greedy and unscrupulous, and slightly less clueless than Rom (though still fairly clueless). One untraditional Ferengi aspect that he shares with Rom is his attraction towards alien women, being obviously smitten by Vash.We also get our first look at Risa in the episode. It would become the go-to planet for referencing popular vacation spots throughout later episodes and series, especially on DS9, including a return to the planet on that show. The Risian catchphrase ""All that is ours, is yours,"" is also re-used in that episode, as are the references to Horga'hns and jamaharon.This story has everything you need for a great episode of sci-fi television. Time travel, mind games, adventure, space babes, and fun, compelling characters that make the story come alive. Definitely one of TNG's best ever.THE GOOD:-Vash -Vash and Picard together-Vash and Sovak together-The scene where Picard is offered jamaharon, then has his confrontation with Sovak, and then gets properly introduced to Vash. The whole scene is gold from beginning to end.-Riker's mischievous smirk at the end. He has his moments.THE BAD:Nothing worth noting hereTHE UGLY:-Time travel always gets messy. I love the storytelling possibilities it opens up, but the paradoxes and complicated interactions it introduces always require a bit more suspension of disbelief than I am able to muster. In particular, now that the Vorgons know exactly where the Uthat is, why wouldn't they just return to the spot before Vash's arrival and dig it up themselves? It makes no sense unless you willfully choose not to think about it, which is sadly the case with 99.9% of time travel stories. Alas. -Making love in the cave. Anybody who has ever been in a real cave knows that they are gross and full of all manner of creepy crawlies-- especially in a jungle area like Risa. Not even the chemistry between Vash and Picard could overcome the mood-killing sensation of having a centipede crawl across your leg or seeing huge spiders on the cave wall.

With Deanna, it has to do with emotional signals and body sense; with others, it's almost like mind reading. Tam Elbrun, the young empath aboard the enterprise, is a super reader of life forms, almost to the point of insanity. He has a checkered history which leads people to fear him, but he is a master at first contact. He has hooked up with ""Tin Man,"" the name given to an entity that looks like a large pine cone. It used to be ship with a crew but circumstances have ended that. The thing has immense power and thinks on its own, but like so many one-of- a-kind creatures, it is filled with dread and loneliness. Tam-Elbrun, being empathic, feels the creature's pain. There is an issue in that the Romulans, who attacked Tin Man are set on revenge because the thing destroyed one of their war birds. Data is taken in on this whole thing because he does not send out any human baggage. This is a really thoughtful episode and well worth the viewing.",8

That makes him different. Speculation--> (In many ways, one could say his character is a symbol for the insane, troubled, sick, lonely, and addicted personalities back here on our planet. Drugs is the big unsaid word in this episode. Sexuality is another big word not said.) I Like when Picard greets Tam welcome. Tam reads his mind and tells Picard what he was thinking, what Picards next command would be. Then Picard does the usual command but a little altered so that Tam does not get to his rights, not just yet. That is Picard in a nutshell.Cronenberg would feel right at home with this storyline.

Howevrer, Elbrun's gift is also a horrible curse, as he reads EVERYONE and cannot shut them out--a rare condition that often drives Betazoids like him insane. He's on edge and Picard and the rest of the crew are worried that he's losing it. Their confidence seems real, as Elbrun once was in therapy with Counselor Troi and suffered a nervous breakdown during one disastrous assignment. Can Elbrun keep his sanity and help the Federation?This is an extremely static episode and like the duller episodes, it's set completely on the Enterprise. It's extremely talky, slow and the overall theme is shockingly uninteresting.",3
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Tin Man (TV Episode 1990)",One of the weaker episodes in a great season,"A large, ancient space creature is discovered in a remote system. The 1701-D takes on a Betazoid first contact specialist and it's a race with the Romulans (randomly inserted) to reach Tin Man first. While occasionally interesting, this is an episode that is ultimately forgettable and mostly dull. Harry Groener guest stars as Tam Elbrun, a sort of autistic-savant type character who is even more gifted than normal Betazoids at reading minds. His character is a stereotypical Aspie--socially awkward and very difficult to get along with, but brilliant and indispensable to Starfleet due to his mind-reading abilities. I understand that his character is supposed to be a difficult person to like, but every time he is on the screen (which is like 90% of the episode), I find myself cringing internally from his awkward and graceless performance. Interestingly, Groener would later go on to play one of TVs best and most interesting villains on Buffy The Vampire Slayer as the evil mayor. The character of Tam Elbrun, however, is a far cry from the slick, smarmy, and incredibly creepy Mayor--and a whole lot less entertaining, too.Aside from the issues with Elbrun, the episode suffers from some other issues. For one, the Romulans seemed tacked onto the story. It feels like the creators of the episode realized late in the process that they had a very boring episode on their hands, and they decided to throw in the Romulans to make things more exciting. It doesn't really work, however, as the Romulans seem to serve no actual point to the story, except as a forced attempt to raise the stakes. The episode may have been better served by spending more time exploring the nature and history of Gomtuu (Tin Man), rather than the Romulans. Star Trek has always made itself interesting by posing intellectual issue for its viewers to consider, not by cheaply throwing in a couple of space battle and explosions.Overall, this is a mediocre episode with unrealized potential and burdened by unlikable characters and a pointless cameo by the Romulans.THE GOOD: -Some decent scenes with Data. The ending scene where he has his ""human moment"" and Troi hugs him is pretty sweet and touching.-We get to see Riker's old ship and captain, the USS Hood and Captain DeSoto, respectively. It's a nice scene when Riker, DeSoto, and Picard are reunited, albeit briefly and only via the viewscreen. Scenes like this do so much for making the characters feel like real people with real lives and histories. Great job here by the writers.-Gomtuu represents some tantalizing ideas. Sadly, they are not adequately explored here.THE BAD:-Troi gets a lot of scenes. She's not overly bad here, just boring. Less Troi is usually better.-The aforementioned issues with Elbrun and the Romulans-The nature, origin, and history of Gomtuu should have been explored more. Giving it more personality might have made the ending more satisfying.THE UGLY:-Hood is also the name of a ship from the Original Series. I know that the TNG Hood was introduced in the pilot, but I still don't like that the name was re-used without adding a letter or re-using the registry number of the original Hood.-The supernova explosion is not only immediately visible, despite being several light-hours away, but the Enterprise doesn't even get hit by a shock wave. Even at that distance, the power of the explosion would be devastating.-There is an offhand comment made that Gomtuu was detected 23 parsecs beyond the borders of the Federation. That is approximately 75 light years. Based on other sources, it seems a Starfleet ship can travel less than 3 light years a day at high warp, meaning this episode takes place over nearly a month's time, followed by another month-long return trip after the episode ends.",4

Lt. Reg Barkley (nicknamed 'Broccoli' by his fellow crew members) was only intended to be in one episode, but apparently he resonated with viewers and writers and in all he had about a dozen appearances.When the show begins, LaForge and Riker are both uncharacteristically negative about a member of the crew. Both see Lt. Barkley as a lazy and disinterested guy. However, their rush to judgment is premature, as Barkley's real problem is that he's painfully shy--so shy that he always doubts himself and is just about paralyzed by his fears. When LaForge approaches the Captain about transferring Barkley off the ship, the Captain is angry and tells LaForge to make things work with Barkley. If that means befriending him or working closely with him, so be it. So, Barkley is finally given an important assignment--to figure out why one of their transporters keeps malfunctioning. Can Barkley rise to the occasion or is he simply hopeless?This episode had a lot of funny moments due to Barkely's bad habit of retreating into the holodeck instead of dealing with people. Inside this piece of machinery, Barkely is a studly hero--and the holo images of the Doctor and Counselor are there to cheer him on and lust after his rugged manliness! It's all clever and fun, but also important because in the 24th century you STILL see that folks have prejudices-- as LaForge and several others are surprisingly cruel towards Barkley. So, despite their advances, people are still people. Well worth seeing.",8

This ""comedy episode escapism"" is highly needed as the show would get plenty intense with the upcoming Borg two-parter, The Best of Both Worlds, as Barclay creates cartoonish, fictitious versions of Enterprise principles as a means to blow off steam as those in his swashbuckling Musketeers fantasy world each play a major role in his inability to function properly in day-to-day ""real life"". There's a problem with a broken canister (the cargo, tissue samples, is needed on another planet due to a breakout of fever, donated by a species) that might have set off a series of events (such as a glass, in Ten Forward, of liquor, in the hands of officers, leaking and the transporter destroying cargo during the molecular stage) that has caused a multitude of malfunctions causing the warp engines to speed to critical stages leading to possible structural failure. Barclay might just assist Geordi in finding the solution to the problem. Barclay has his share of problems, which are examined: Riker is not particularly fond of Barclay, Troi is Barclay's object of lust, and various moments of incompetence could prove fatal to Barclay's career on the Enterprise. Barclay's nickname—thanks to Wesley—is Broccoli, and a visit to Troi under therapy (orders from Geordi who takes some wise advice from Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg, who would appear in sporadic guest spots on the show to offer guidance to characters when needed) on how to deal with Barclay), not to mention the forays into the Holodeck fantasies, all yield funny results at the expense of Schultz' quivering, bumbling character. Seeing Jonathan Frakes as weakened goofs in the holodeck worlds as imagined by Barclay, Patrick Steward under red curly locks, hat and costume, unable to handle Barclay's swordplay, and the way Troi is envisioned as a vixen offering herself to Barclay's pleasure are certainly memorable bits of whimsy certain to earn grins and chuckles from series' fans. This is one of those episodes that give us a chance to unwind and laugh without much in the way of dramatic weight. Seeing Riker so ill-at-ease with an officer is quite fascinating (he really does show a frustration in Barclay's ""derelict of duty""), as well as, Geordi's needing inspiration from others (like Picard who insists that Barclay be given a chance, although his slip in calling him Broccoli is a howler) just to cope with Barclay's errors, really provide insight in the struggle to deal with officers who may not be considered ""Enterprise material"".

Picard is the moral center of this, pushing Geordi to connect with Barclay and expose his talents. This is really a workplace drama, but a good one.This one really surprised me. It does mine Barclay's ""holodiction"" for laughs, but it also ends in a nail-biter of a last-minute save; there's a surprising level of action here for a character piece.

He has incredibly complex programs where he lives his life of adventure, Walter Mitty style. Obviously, he is incredibly talented but with absolutely no self-esteem. He is also careless and undependable. The factor that makes what he does a bit disconcerting is that he uses the images of actual crew members a the models for his characters (this is not a violation, but it is frowned upon). He even has a passionate, submissive characterization of Troi. I've always wondered about the Holodeck. Apparently, anyone who wishes can walk in on another person, so I guess you'd better not do anything embarrassing. It is hilarious to watch Picard and Data as Musketeers, battling the master swordsman, Barclay.

Indeed. That's one of the most relatable things here. His experience in Starfleet Academy surely mirrors my experience in college, filled with not being able to perform the assigned tasks satisfactorily, being disliked equally by students and professors, and just being pushed along to get me out of their way. I find it unlikely that Barklay is oblivious to this, just as I wasn't. Maybe he tried to keep a stiff upper lip and go through, even as his self-esteem disappears, in hopes of being able for his career dreams are fulfilled after graduation, only never to happen. Though, it's clear that he didn't belong at the Academy and can't be tolerated by his crew mates any more than he could by his classmates. The body language of others alone makes this obvious.This is of course Star Trek and we can't be led to think that there are some people that are just worthless, so we eventually come to see that Barklay does have some talents. It might have been more realistic to let us realize that yes, some people are just worthless, and those people should be relegated to doing things that even they can't muck up (too much) and there's no way they should be doing anything like working in the engineering section on a starship.",

Kidnapped by a ruthless collector named Kivas Fajo, played by Saul Rubinek. Kivas places a high value of his possessions. Including, but not limited to, a painting of Mona Lisa, rare animal life, and a Roger Maris baseball card. Data becomes yet another part of the collection.Back on the Enterprise, a strange string of coincidences lead them to a conspiracy. They soon track down Kivas Fajo.Meanwhile, Data has convinced Varria, a long time companion of Kivas, to help him escape. Data was able to prove to her that she herself was nothing more then a part of Fajo's collection.The escape is nearly foiled. Fajo owns some very powerful, and illegal phaser, that ""kills brutally and slowly"". Fajo kills Varria with the weapon. However, the other one that Fajo owned is a few feet away from Data. Picking up the weapon, Data confronts Fajo. Fajo torments Data, and dares Data to kill him. He tempts him more by saying ""If only you could feel rage about Varria's death, but you're just a machine."" In one of his most human moments, Data is about to ignore his prime programming about respecting life, when he is beamed aboard the Enterprise.O'Brien realizes the weapon has been discharged, and neutralizes it before Data is beamed over. When asked about the firing of a weapon, Data shrugs it off. Both Riker and O'Brein glance at each other, questioningly.Fajo is now being held in the brig and Data pays him a visit. Data informs Fajo that his collection is being returned to the respective rightful owners. When Fajo comments about Data taking pleasure in his downfall, Data counters back with ""I have no feelings...I am just a machine!"" and walks out, leaving behind a very dejected Fajo.The Most Toys did the most to expand the human side of Data without him getting some chip or other program. He became human, if even for s split second, merely because of his surroundings. The needless death of a woman who showed Data compassion, risked, and lost her life for him. And Data doing exactly what most of us would have done in his position, and try and get revenge!",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Most Toys (TV Episode 1990)",Outstanding acting / great writing,"At first, this episode seemed rather boring. Then, a few scenes later, Saul Rubinek took command. He plays the antagonist Kivas Fajo to perfection. As is the case with movies as well, a lot of these episodes are dependent on the screen writing and the acting. Whereas a lot of the acting by guest stars in the first two seasons of ""Next Generation"" was shaky, I find myself praising season three's acting quite often. Well, in my opinion, Rubinek takes the season three gold ring for his portrayal of a fat, ugly, psychopathic, lecherous nerd. And when his kidnapping of Data went from the addition of a rare piece to his collection to a possible solution to his twisted carnal desires, the writing went from great to spectacular.This one is definitely in my top three for season three.",9
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Most Toys (TV Episode 1990)",Data on Display!,"I was totally taken in by Fajo's despicable character. In just a few minutes, he made me despise him. His whiny being, his mean spiritedness, his entitlement, all lead one to find him as bad as they get. When he kidnaps Data so he can display him as a prize, he gets more than he bargained for. The only way he can get the Android to obey his wishes is through threat to another crew member who has been loyal to him for most of her life. He has not regard for life or loyalty and may be the most self-centered character on record. I did love that his collection of artifacts included a 1962 Roger Maris Topps baseball card (the year after he broke Ruth's single season record). The one thing that Data doesn't do for him is to perform for his friends when they come one board. What good is this stuff if you can't impress someone with it? Kudos to Saul Rubinek whom we've seen in countless character roles over the years. The diminutive elf with the razor's edge is inscrutable to the bitter end.",9

While Data tries to escape, Geordi on the Enterprise refuses to believe he has died and goes out of the way to prove otherwise.Trivia note: while rummaging through Data's apartment, Geordi and Wesley come across the Data's Tasha Yar hologram (first seen in ""The Measure Of A Man"").

6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Most Toys (TV Episode 1990)",Big boy toys,Saul Rubinek guest stars in this Star Trek TNG story in a fascinating portrayal of a very rich man who collects unusual and rare things. He's decided that the most advanced android in the world even though he's a member of Star Fleet is just what he needs to make him the envy of his peers.I guess you could say Rubinek is a futuristic Donald Trump who few people have ever said 'no' to in his life. I will say he rather cleverly captures Brent Spiner and for a while makes everyone think he's been destroyed. Dead does not seem a proper term for an android.In his own passive way Data resists mightily and it takes a while for his crew mates on the Enterprise to figure out he's been captured. In the end it works out.The scenes with Spiner and Rubinek are really fascinating. Don't miss this TNG story.,7
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Most Toys (TV Episode 1990)",Quick review reply,"I just want to reply that the dude that claim bad writing is the reason why Data does what he does and doesn't punch Kivas is because it's been shown time and time again that Data can't touch Kivas because of his force field. How did the reviewer miss that? Babianarsle.That aside, I think this is a very strong episode as a whole. The ultimate dilemma on what Data is and isn't capable of is an interesting one which lifts a still strong episode off the beaten path. I think killing a kidnapper and stopping a cruel man killing more innocents is very justifiable, and I would like to think that Data acknowledges that in the end.",9

I cannot say exactly when the plot was first used, but it was the subject in ""Dr. Who"" back in the 1970s (""The Sun Makers"") and was used later on ""The Simpsons"" (""Treehouse of Terror X"")--so this ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" episode isn't exactly unique. Because of this, it cannot be one of the better episodes of the series--but I did really like the way it ended.When the episode begins, Data is accidentally killed and the crew of the Enterprise grieves for this loss. However, what actually occurred is that a dirt-bag named Kivas Fajo (Saul Rubinek) stole Data in order to add it to his sick little collection of rarities. He really has no interest in Data as anything other than a curiosity--and because he and no one else in the universe can have him. Despite being very strong and bright, Data is unable to escape from this sociopath's clutches.The bottom line is that Fajo's cruelty and Data's ultimate solution to this is makes this one memorable. Well worth seeing despite its familiarity.",7

Watching it for the second time last night (27 years after first seeing it!), I was reminded of the series' failure (in later episodes) to develop what is introduced here.Data is put in an untenable situation, as he doesn't know he's about to be rescued. What should he do with Kivas? * The man is a murderer **, but Data's programming will not let him kill someone except in self-defense (or immediate defense of others). So why doesn't he just give Kivas a zetz im kopf and tie him up? (He has no trouble overpowering Kivas' goons.)Instead, he decides to kill Kivas, a fraction of second after the transporter begins operating. He ""explains"" the weapon's discharge by saying ""something might have happened"". He later tells Kivas (in a subtly ironic tone) that he ""has no feelings. I am an android.""Data's programming is (presumably) sufficiently complex for his experiences to alter his behavior, and even his world view. We see this in his speaking the literal truth, twisted to cover his real ""feelings"". But this potential for unexpected and even self-serving behavior isn't explored in later episodes. Perhaps it was decided that the audience would not tolerate turning a sympathetic character into a potentially threatening one.* The name appears to be a reference to the ""kivas and trillium"" Spock was supposed to be a dealer in.** Saul Rubinek gives a great performance going through the ""agony"" of deciding whether to kill his female companion.",7

This time, he has a new wife named Perrin (since Amanda who was Spock's mother, has already died long ago). When Sarek boards the Enterprise, the famed Vulcan ambassador begins to emit emotions, being moved to tears by a performance in which Data is a participant on the violin. As the episode progresses, we see that Sarek's mind isn't what it used to be as violence and emotional outbursts escalate by various crew on the Enterprise (including an Original Series inspired Ten Forward barfight).Special note: GREAT and TOUCHING performance by Patrick Stewart as Picard.Trivia note: Data played on the violin in an earlier 3rd season episode ""The Ensigns of Command"". We also see the planet Vulcan in this episode. And, Picard met Sarek years ago at his son's wedding (we assume he meant Spock).",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Sarek (TV Episode 1990)",*Spoilers* Patrick Stewart steals the show,"One of the wonderful qualities of Patrick Stewart is that he can either steal the show or step back and allow another actor to take the focus and shine. It is by far one of his greatest strengths.In this episode, when Patrick Stewart has Sarek's emotions, his acting is top notch. The emotions he transitions between move along seamlessly. You feel a great deal of empathy for him and, moreover, for Sarek, even though Sarek isn't in that scene. Picard is actually acting two roles at the same time and he's phenomenal. I am blown away every time I watch this episode. The depth of acting talent and a lifetime of work go into this one scene. This episode easily stands as one of the top 10 TNG episodes.",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Sarek (TV Episode 1990)",Sarek,"""Peace and long life."" ""Live Long and Prosper."" ""It's ironic, isn't it? All this magnificent technology, we still find ourselves susceptible to the ravages of old age. Loss of dignity. The slow betrayal of our bodies by forces we cannot master.""While I think the first two seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation have some terrific episodes, the third season, in my opinion, shows the series hitting its stride. I'm a sentimentalist when it comes to Trek because of my overwhelming fondness for the Classic Star Trek show, so when a member of that series is on the The Next Generation, I find myself giddy and extra emotionally involved. Those who are moved by Picard's big emotional scene where he has mind-melded with Sarek, in turn taking upon himself all of the repressed emotions and effects of the Bendii Syndrome effecting the 200 year old Vulcan, I think a lot of this comes from the affinity for the 60s Star Trek show. We know that Vulcans have mastered the ability to repress emotion, logic the means behind their salvation from extinction, but when Picard communicates the assault of buried emotions regarding his love for Spock and wife Perrin, it has profoundness to it. We have seen the meetings between father and son, what they conceal from each other due to their way of life, yet ultimately both do know how they truly feelit is repressed but there, just so deeply held in place and shielded. Truly, I think this exemplary episode functions as a sympathetic look at mental deterioration (Althzheimer's perhaps the greatest inspiration drawn from) and how such old age breakdown can affect those around him/her. Sarek, in this case, causes officers on board the Enterprise to angrily accuse, even violently respond, to each other in hostile ways due to Vulcan telepathy. A Vulcan aide has been able somewhat to keep Sarek's condition under control, but the strain of the process of beginning negotiations with an alien race known as Legarians (that has taken decades to prepare for) has made this increasingly difficult. Picard notices this and wants to help Sarekit will take a mind-meld in order to do so. Hours of intense, agonizing emotional pain is what Picard must endure while he gives Sarek the calm, assured part needed for the delicate negotiating process. ""My mind to your mind. Your thoughts to my thoughts."" I'm sure Trek die-hards will find much to enjoy with this episode and seeing Mark Leonard return in the role of Sarek was most welcome.",10

Sarek is losing control of his emotions on the eve of his crowning diplomatic achievement - which is shattering to a Vulcan and an interesting way to see the effects of dementia. Picard says it best: ""It's ironic, isn't it? All this magnificent technology, and we still find ourselves susceptible to the ravages of old age"" But it's also Picard who ends up coming through in the end, and the scenes with Stewart and Lenard are both powerful and heartbreaking.Honestly, before watching this, I'd just expected to see Sarek show up as little more than a nod, like DeForest Kelley in 'Encounter at Farpoint'.But this was a surprisingly considerate story.9/10",9

Of course he's also the father of Spock from the original series.Because Vulcans have a few centuries of lifetime it is highly logical that Sarek return to this new Enterprise and its crew. Mark Lenard is about to cap off the final triumph of his career, a treaty with a race that's been most reluctant to participate in the universe within the Federation.Unfortunately because of a Vulcan malady he is losing the great emotional reserve that Vulcans prize as the key to their way of living. The strain on him and his aides in keeping his emotions in check is being passed on to the crew. Can you believe Wesley Crusher and Geordi LaForge in a brawl?It's up to Patrick Stewart to work out a solution for Sarek and get that treaty signed. The solution chosen is as much a strain on Captain Picard as on Sarek.Scenes with Stewart and Lenard are some of the best in the TNG series.

Interestingly, later the character would reappear--with Ben Cross playing him in the reboot of the series, ""Star Trek"" (2009).When the ancient ambassador arrives on the Enterprise for some important negotiations, the Captain is surprised at Sarek's handlers. Despite his looking amazingly good for a being over 200, his wife and assistant treat him as if he's very frail and are protecting him from others. Why? At the same time, strange things begin happening on the ship. Crew members start acting VERY emotional towards each other-- with angry outbursts, near fights and worse. Could it be that Sarek is somehow responsible for this? And, if so, how?! And, how can they hold an important conference is Sarek makes those around him enraged?!All in all, a very sad episode of the series, as you see a beloved character succumbing to the sad effects of aging. Now I am NOT complaining about this--it is good to talk about dementias and other types of geriatric illnesses. But it is still quite sad. Well worth seeing.By the way, Picard makes a brief comment that made me take notice. He indicated that he'd briefly met Sarek before...at his (Sarek's) son's wedding!

He has a condition that often comes to Vulcan men when they reach their 200th birthday and beyond. He has begun to lose some of his basic faculties and she is aware of this. He is determined to put this negotiating feather in his cap, however. Unfortunately, because he has powers of telepathy, the disease is causing disarray on the Enterprise. Crew members get into fights. They are edgy and angry. There's even near fisticuffs with Geordi and Wesley, pushing and shoving until Riker breaks it up.

Breaking the laws of both time and decency, they got pre-Neelix Ethan Philips to play a Ferengi doctor torturing the kidnapped Lwaxana. What, you think i could make this up?? In the midst of this tragedy of, um, Shakespearean proportions, there's a thread of beauty...Wesley gives up his spot at the Academy to run back and save the day.

The fun is in the efforts to outsmart the exo-eared aliens. Playing on their greed and their sensualities things come to a nice turn. My favorite scene is when Jean-Luc, in order to put a stop to Lwaxana's betrothal, begins to spout poetry, along with a threat of destroying the Ferengi ship and everyone on it.

You may also recognize him as a Native from Gilligan's Island, and he was last seen as the Ferengi ""Gegis"" in the Voyager episode ""Inside Man"" (Where they steal Lt. Broccoli's Hologram). So this is a Ferengi for All Trade Negotia...

Tog's Doctor, Farek (a Pre- Neelix Ethan Phillips) thinks he is being foolish, and continues to think that.Riker and Troi decide to take leave on Betazed and their Sylvan Glade is interrupted by Lwaxana and Mr Hom (Carel Struycken) - This is the last time we see him, even though he is referred to in other episodes.But Riker and Troi have more to worry about than being Coitus Interruptus by Lwaxana - They are Interruptus by Tog who beams down with Ferengi ""pericules"".Lwaxana should have been honored, but Tog was of the Old-School Ferengi, not the enlightened type like Quark and Rom. Besides, the changes in Ferengi Society which take place in Deep Space Nine had not happened yet.Tog beams them all back to The Krayten, and when they all wake up he transports Lwaxana and Troi to the Bridge - San Clothing, in the best Transporter Effect of all Trek.The Krayton is a Ferengi Ship full of Ferengi Gadgets - Transporters that are programmed to remove females clothing, and beds that come out of their Daimon's walls!Majel Lee Hudec Barret-Roddenberry is the spotlight of this entire episode, you can see the disgust roll off of her face as Daimon Tog touches her. But she fools him well - But not well enough to get his command codes before Neelix-Farek catches her and sticks her into a Ferengi BrainSuck Machine.Meanwhile, the Enterprise had to go check out another Stellar Nursery, so they don't know about this abduction until they get back to Betazed. They can't find The Krayton, Ferengi Toads have even better security then The Federation.As Riker finds out, after he punches his Ferengi Jailer in the nose and almost breaks his hand: He can't break into the Krayton's Comm System, so he creates a warp field distortion that can't be mistaken as random. This gives the Enterprise an arrow to follow as to their whereabouts, and it was Wesley again who figures it out- Wesley was supposed to leave and go to Starfleet Academy, but his last minute discovery gives him a few more episode's grace on the show- And Picard elevates him to full Ensign for that time.This was the episode where we learned quite a bit about Ferengi Civilization - Their Females to not deserve the honor of Clothing, and that their Lobes are the most sensual part of their bodies - Introducing Oo-Mox, the arousal of a Ferengi Male by the stroking of his lobes.This gives Lwaxana ammunition she uses against Quark later in Deep Space Nine.

However, he begins to heal at a phenomenal rate, faster than even Dr. Crusher thinks is possible, when he begins to exhibit other symptoms wholly unrelated to his injuries. Soon, he even starts affecting the Enterprise crew including Geordi LaForge who now has new-found confidence in himself (reversing his bad luck streak with women) and heals Chief O'Brien's kayaking wound with a simple touch.However, soon a ship from this person's homeworld demands his return because he is a criminal and very dangerous.What is the Enteprise to believe?

5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Best of Both Worlds (TV Episode 1990)",Super Segue into the Next Generation of Episodes,"The Borg are such a juggernaut. When one fights an enemy in war, one generally has an adversary that may be irrational, but that plays by some kind of rules. The Borg is a bee colony and it's a self sustaining entity. The entire colony has one purpose: to absorb everything in its path and make itself stronger. Intellect is of no use unless it helps the collective learn something. All sentient life is meaningless. They are the dead look in the shark's eye. As we will see later, they do speak and threaten. ""Resistance is useless"" is the response to all. In this episode we realize that the Federation has been anticipation this threat for a long time and decides to send its full arsenal at the Borg. The results of that and the future of Picard are the issues in the first half of this episode. At this point, the show kicked into a different gear, putting great stresses on all involved and confronting an entity that would haunt, not just the people in this series, but the Voyager crew as well.",10

It's much more suspenseful. I believe that the writers almost painted (wrote) themselves into a corner. Sure Part 2 has more ""phaser and dog fight"" action. Here the viewer gets to go inside one of the most complicated interiors ever used in a sci-fi series. Some of it is probably duplicated by either mirrors or mattes, but it seems to go on into infinity. We get a real ""Cooks Tour"" of the whole place. We get altered humanoids that plug into the circuits like cell phones. Why Picard's old uniform would be saved in an IKEA-inspired dresser is beyond me. The Borg costuming is amazing and very intricate. ""Frankenstein's Monsters"" of the future. The shape and design of The Borg Cube Spaceship looks entirely wrong on purpose. A clunky square goes against all the engineering design principles of conventional streamlining. Part 1 is a real ""cliffhanger"",while Part 2 is more predictable as it all must come to a logical conclusion. Both parts together set the framework for the movie ""First Contact"" with the incredible evil Borg Queen.",10
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Best of Both Worlds (TV Episode 1990)",Season Three,"The first two seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation ranged (in quality) from dreadful to uneven. There were some good stories being told and the characters were progressing somewhat, but nowhere near on a consistent basis. Fortunately, this Third Season is where Next Generation establishes itself as a very quality product.Perhaps the biggest difference in this season is that there is a noticeable decrease in ""clunker"" episodes, as there really aren't any eps that are truly atrocious (a fairly common occurrence in the previous campaigns). Clearly, the writing was improved.Another thing I liked about this season was that the stories were so varied. From single-arc mysteries to Data (Brent Spiner) creating offspring to over-arcing Roman plots, Season Three had a little bit of everything in a very nice mix. Of course, the return of the Borg at the end of the season may be the highlight, as Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) faces his greatest challenge yet. Basically, some great diverse storytelling and pacing.I'm not going to summarize or review specific episodes here, but suffice it to say that Season Three is when Next Generation really makes the leap from ""not sure this is ever going to come around"" to ""this is quality television"". I hate to point fingers or cast aspersions, but the common rhetoric for this change is that Gene Roddenberry was less involved in the scripts by this time. While Roddenberry was a great world-builder (not unlike George Lucas of Star Wars fame), his week-to-week scripts or ideas tended to be rather pompous or high-minded. They either really worked or crashed-and-burned magnificently. So, while the decline of Roddenberry was obviously something that no one in the Trek universe wanted to see happen, it may have unintentionally allowed the show's writers to ""loosen the bonds"" a bit, working out for the better.Bottom Line: If you can hold out until this Third Season, you'll become hooked on Next Generation, as this is when the character development and stories finally entertain on an almost every-episode basis. My exact star rating would be 4.5.",9

He also displays a perspicacity than unnerves everyone except Deanna.The ""B"" plot: the ""Enterprise"" is ordered to transport hundreds (512 to be exact) of deadly viruses and other pathogens to a planet suffering from a devastating plague, the cause of which is unknown. The newly promoted Geordi creates a containment field to keep the bugs in stasis.However, one of the bugs begins to multiply, stimulated, apparently, by a form of radiation given off my Troi's child. If the containment vessel is breached, the ""Enterprise"" will become a ship of the dead within hours.The episodes ending, neatly intertwining both the A and B plot-lines, is a rare Star Trek tear-jerker.* No sense in repeating russem31's rather extensive list of the changes appearing in this the very first episode, so I'll merely comment on some of them and add a few he/she didn't.--Gates McFadden took off a season in order to raise her child (in a first season ""feaurette"" celebrating the unveiling of a new Paramount office building named in Gene Roddenberry's honor, a very pregnant McFadden can be seen). Fortunately, she decided to return to TNG.--Diana Muldaur steps in as CMO (very much in Rosalind Shays mode, her very next gig), and begins by offending the Captain and then displays her disdain for Data be deliberately mispronouncing his name.Muldaur had, by this time, lost the fragile beauty that was so enchanting in her two Old Trek episodes (as well as her co-starring turn with John Wayne in ""McQ""). The vulnerability she displayed in her early work is now gone; perhaps this is one reason she was such a delicious villain on L.A. Law.--Wesley decides he can't leave the ""Enterprise"" and asks, and receives, permission from Picard to remain aboard while ""pursuing"" his Academy studies. (Frankly, always found this rationale more than a little flimsy, how likely is it that Annapolis would allow a midshipman to do his--or her!--course work by correspondence while working aboard a ship?) --Marina Sirtis's hair does assume the style that she's sport until season six; while the pseudo-Princess Leia ""bun"" is gone, Sirtis is saddled with a pretty heavy weave. So, I imagine is was a relief, when she's allowed to her hair returned to its natural, brunette color.--Data's personality begins to become more human-like, a response, surely, to his being surround be humans only a daily basis. Since he had been in the company of human/oids for nearly two decades before the point at which TNG begins, it's always struck me as odd that he seemed almost completely oblivious to the nature and habits of creatures he's been interacting with for such a long period...--Some fantastic computer graphics (for the day) are to be seen when the cargo of bugs is beamed aboard. Such intricate graphics will not become the regular part of a show until J. Michael Straczynski's Babylon 5.*This is not, of course, to say, that Star Trek is devoid of moving, tragic scenes, the most obvious being Spock's death scene in Star Trek II & Data's death in Star Trek 10. And, most famously, the death of Edith Keeler (Joan Collins) in the celebrated ""City on the Edge of Forever"" episode during the first season of Old Trek (the script, written by Harlan Ellison, whose ego is in inverse proportion to his size, is inarguably the best thing he's ever written.)",8

4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Child (TV Episode 1988)","Some interesting background to ""The Child""","It turns out, as revealed in the first part of ""Making It So: Continuing ST:TNG"" (a retrospective documentary that appears on the Blu-ray release of season 2), that this story was originally written for the projected (but never made) ""Star Trek: Phase II"", with Captain Kirk et al plus three new characters. With the Hollywood writers' strike looming, rather than come up with a new story, ""The Child"" was revised, with the parts originally written for the new characters of Phase II given to Riker, Troi and Data.
Of course, some new elements were necessary: introducing Dr Pulaski, explaining the decision of Wesley Crusher to remain with the Enterprise, and so on. This would explain many of the complaints in earlier reviews published here: notably that the plot isn't up to the standard of other ST:TNG scripts of the time. Simply put, it's not really a ST:TNG script, but a composite of an older script with new characters transposed into it. And, to my mind, it's done pretty seamlessly.",6
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Child (TV Episode 1988)","According to IMDb, Miss Sirtis disliked this episode...but I thought the concept was amazing and highly original.","Often, I have found that when my reviews for ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" it's usually because I dislike a show and others haven't. However, this is an unusual case where I loved a show that was generally disliked or at least scored in the mediocre range. And, interesting, Marina Sirtis (who starred in this particular episode) especially disliked it! Yet, I thought it was terrific.When the show begins, the Enterprise passes through space and an alien presence enters the ship. However, it looks more like a tiny glowing light and is not detected. Now here's where it gets weird-- the light impregnates Counselor Troi and soon the new doctor, Dr. Pulaski, informs the Captain. Soon, things get even weirder, as instead of the normal 10 month gestation period for Betazoids, the child is delivered (pain-free and without all the icky amniotic fluids) only a few days later! Soon, the child has grown to appear about age 8 within a day!!! At the same time, however, a very dangerous load of plasma plague is taken aboard and the child might just pose a risk to this cargo.I loved the concept of an alien race creating a link to humans through an impregnation--talk about a first contact! To me, it's one of the more interesting concepts I've seen in the series. While I felt a tiny bit disappointed how it all resolved itself, it still worked very well and made for an interesting and emotionally-charged episode. I especially liked Ms. Sirtis' acting--watching her cry and emote was quite nice, as it expanded her otherwise limited range on the show. By the way, I felt a little bad for Diana Muldaur in this and subsequent episodes. Her task of substituting for Gates McFadden's character wasn't easy at all. But, the writers sure made it a lot tougher with the dialog they saddled her with when it came to Data. She comes off as surprisingly clueless and insensitive towards him-- referring to him as 'it' and acting rather patronizing towards him. In hindsight, I don't think this was a wise decision. Having her be curious and even a bit taken aback would have worked, but in the Trekkie 24th century, she seems out of step due to her prejudices towards him.",9
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Child (TV Episode 1988)",The Interconnectedness of the Universe,"This is certainly interesting if one doesn't think too much. Sometimes this series goes over into realms beyond speculative physics. I guess the convoluted nature of the plan here has some acceptable parameters. But the whole childbirth thing and all its implications seems pretty far fetched, even for an alien intervention. It is interesting watching Data's fascination with the human (well, almost human) birth. He seems to wired to certain emotional connections. The virus being managed takes on a minor role throughout, and that is at times disappointing. What is even more disappointing is when dumb luck, not based on any actions of the crew or the captain come into play. A couple of other things thrown in. Diana Muldaur and her Dr. Pulaski serving as Crusher's replacement and the maybe/maybe not of Wesley's staying on board the Enterprise. Ho hum!",6
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Child (TV Episode 1988)",Weird and Gross,"In ""The Child"" an unknown ethereal alien lifeform impregnates Troi in her sleep with itself, wanting to experience a humanoid lifecycle. Meanwhile newly promoted Chief Engineer Geordi is tasked with creating containment units for deadly pathogens and diseases that need to be transported to a science base to be studied for possible cures to a current disease wiping out a corner of the galaxy.Of all the weird scripts to kickoff Season 2 of TNG, they chose the one where Troi is basically raped by an unknown entity and forced into motherhood? Then the kid is also radioactive and endangering the ship with his presence? And the kid is aging quicker than new Spock did in ST3? What a weird decision guys, no me gusta.All of this combines to detract and distract from all the good improvements we have in Season 2: better lighting, new and more defined roles for the crew, some colorful new uniforms. All of this is very exciting. However when you kick off your season with an a-hole of an entity that without permission rapes, impregnates, births itself, almost causes a ship-wide meltdown, and emotionally manipulates Troi, how am I suppose to focus on any of these positives?Cute puppies though...",2
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Child (TV Episode 1988)",Ridiculous Episode,"I just watched this episode for probably the third time in my life. As others have written, it is forgettable, and I remembered only bits and pieces of it as I watched it. I understand why Marina Sirtis hated it. The story is ridiculous, and it lacks real, genuine tension. It's also implausible, even for a futuristic science fiction setting. This episode also marks the introduction of Diana Muldaur as Doctor Pulaski. Almost every Trek fan hated her because she replaced the sexy and talented Gates McFaddden then whined about her experience on the show years later.I'm going to rank it 3 stars only because Sirtis's acting is believable despite the fact that she knew that her character's situation was ridiculous, which makes her performance even more impressive.",3
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Child (TV Episode 1988)",Season Opener Flop,"The episode was just weird. Not sure what they were thinking making this the opener of season 2.

I believe that there may be something wrong with the ratings or someone has put 1 by mistake.The episode is not so much exciting as it is ""moving"" and well executed. On the other hand it does contain a certain amount of intensity that is seen throughout the Star Trek TNG series. The main reason for me rating this episode is down to the oddly low rating. There are a few ""not-so-good"" episodes throughout the entire series. This, however, is always remembered by me as one of the better ones (out of the earlier episodes).EDIT: The only problem is that it is a little bit slow paced at times. I originally gave this a 10 but I have downgraded it to 7 because it is good in comparison to other early episodes but it is not one of the best overall.",7

Geordi's running Engineering, cosmetic changes abound on the bridge, chief among them the origin of Riker's beard (game-changer, baby!). The bad news is we also get Dr. Pulaski and her anti-android prejudice.But as for the actual episode, we get the Enterprise transporting some sort of death plasma, while Counselor Troi gets impregnated by a glowing blue sparkle (so, Tinkerbell?) and delivers a baby within hours. Miracle of pain and scar-free delivery, no less. All kidding aside, there's actually some emotional weight to this, as the child is linked to the plasma stuff and the Enterprise is under threat.

Including Troi. It's just... And then this rapist child is instantly born, ages 8 years in a day or whatnot, and then dies. And Troi expresses legit attachment and grief.

13,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Child (TV Episode 1988)",A Milestone,"The Child is not a great episode by any means. It's probably completely forgettable. But like others have commented, this is a major milestone for the series. Besides the annoyingly ugly Dr. Polaski ( a sharp contrast to the GMILF that is Gates McFadden ), the changes to the show do put it out of the dated First season and begins to show the true potential of this show.Star Trek the Original Series is a tough act to follow! But as you can see at this point in the series they have what it takes to start a new generation of fans, and it worked.One thing others didn't mention is that the opening theme is changed ever-so-slightly by adding a techno bass drone to the original mission statement. It's very subtle but as a techno artist I noticed it.All that aside, and the real reason I came here to comment, is the WIG. That's right. Somewhere obvious in this episode there is a gigantic blonde wig on a grey eyebrowed man. It's very Andy Warhol. It's gotta be one of the more hilarious jokes they tried to pull off. At least since they decided to use a banana clip as Geordi's Visor, and when they do close-ups you can see brown eyes behind it, not blind white eyes(plus that has got to be a safety hazard if not degrading to wear-now you know why Geordi got the engine room and fewer away missions). Makes you have to ask yourself ""what were they thinking?"" sometimes. Ah well, in such a revolutionary series, it's easy to ignore the tiny flaws, but I still can't help but let out a little giggle when I see that tribble-looking monster toupee that guy is wearing.",8
14,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Child (TV Episode 1988)",is there any pain..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 02With new smart ideas, compelling dramatic pieces and ethical dilemmas that makes you think twice, the second round of this enterprise crew is surely an improvement where more diversity and maturity is visible.The ChildThis in and out mission had a smart idea to start off the season but what made it smart and dull was ""no threats"" antagonist, that only plays with borderline risk which is left to imagination, the only issue is, there aren't any close calls to amplify the momentum.",
15,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Child (TV Episode 1988)",Star Trek TNG- The Child,"The second season of Star Trek: The Next Generation is kind of regarded as the red-headed step child of the series, a bit underrated in my opinion, but not considered of the same quality as the seasons which came after. Some things happen after the first season. Beverly Crusher has left the ship to become head of Starfleet Medical and son Wesley really doesn't want to leave the Enterprise. Guinan(Whoopi Goldberg who would make occasional appearances on the show), the ""bartender"" of Ten Forward would be introduced. Taking over Crusher's position in the sick bay is Dr. Katherine Pulaski (Diana Muldaur), who can be stubborn and bull-headed, doesn't take to the transporter, and is more ""seasoned"" that her predecessor. Interesting that the show would open with a less action-packed episode, more focused on a very unusual storyline, that of Deanna Troi becoming pregnant from an ""unidentified energy source"", in actuality a life-form entity that resembles a bright star. The threat of this episode is specimens of a plague to be contained on board the Enterprise and taken to a starbase for further study to determine if a cure can be found. In one of the protective modules is a specimen that has started to grow. The stimulation of this growth could be the child born from Troi (she really bonds with the baby from the moment she sees the fetus videoed from her womb and refuses to abort it despite how the lifeform ""chose"" her without permission). The baby, from the moment it first started to form inside her, grows at an alarming rate and the birth did not prove difficult for Troi. But what is the purpose of the lifeform? How will the Enterprise crew contain the growing specimen before it breaks from the module threatening everyone on board? The result of the story really did nothing to stimulate my interest except for Marina Sirtis' performance as a new mother who really cares for her child even though he is not the most ordinary lifeform. The episode ends rather predictably, but is really a starting point for the show going forward. Muldaur has a moment with Data (he ""takes offense"" to being called ""Data"" instead of the pronunciation of ""Day-ta""), but hadn't really broke out with the character during her first episode. While many TNG fans didn't like her, I think there were certain episodes during the second season where Muldaur had her moments. Anyway, Wesley haters will not like this episode as it dedicates a sub-plot specifically to him (the show seems hell bent on getting him involved when it could) on the decision to leave or ask Captain Picard permission to stay on the Enterprise. John Cassavete fans will recognize Seymour Cassel as Lt. Commander Hester Dealt, the one dedicated to making sure the specimens get to the starbase without a hitch, a scientist behind the search for the plague's cure. Riker has a beard, Worf is Chief of Security, and Leforge is Chief of Engineering. I think the show was still trying to find its way and the signs of that potential I think are evident by the set up with this first episode of the second season.",6

If that character is Miles O'Brien, then there is a glitch in the story, according to Star Trek lore, O'Brien didn't have a military rank throughout DS9, so it should be impossible for him to be Lieutenant at the time of this episode. There was no mention about him losing ranks, and his story which unveils in DS9 tells the audience, that he has never been a military ranked officer, which made him unique to be on board a vessel, or a space-dock being Chief Engineering Officer.Of course he is a skilled soldier if the situation demands it, for proof watch Season 7 episodes, or one particular episode of Star Trek DS9: Terok Nor.",8
0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Where Silence Has Lease (TV Episode 1988)","The first ""Red Shirt"" casualty of Next Generation.","There is a lot more going on in this episode than I originally thought. First off, we get to see Worf's calisthenics program for the first time. Then we get to see another ""hole in space"" similar to ""the immunity syndrome"" from Star Trek the original series.And of course the Enterprise D gets sucked up into this new hole. But instead of finding a huge solar system sized single celled organism, we find that first nothing.And then it seems like the enterprise can't do anything but move around in circles even though they are moving in a straight line, it seems they have found a hole in space where nothing exists and they can't get out because there are no directions, turns, referents. No up, down, sideways, and no matter or energy.Except: A Romulan ship which is too easy to blow up, a representation of the enterprise sister-ship Yamato, which is not really there.And suddenly there is a new helm officer sitting where Wesley was sitting, a red-shirt named ""Haskell"": I want to ask anybody who has seen this many times, did anybody notice that Wesley was suddenly missing and Haskell came from nowhere?Because Haskell appears when something new appears: an entity named ""Nigilum""- Who offers immediately that he had trouble making his appearance seem human.But any entity that could re-create a Romulan Warbird, or the Enterprise sister-ship is probably better at putting on faces then he/it would claim, he even seems to understand what gender is, even though he wants Dr. Polasky to demonstrate with Worf.This entity was never really explained in this episode, or ever referred to again and any next generation, Deep Space 9, or Voyager story.But if we consider the original series episode ""immunity syndrome"", there was a single celled organism in a similar hole in space. Is it too far of a stretch to consider that Nigilum, is a descendant of that original single celled organism? If it was as large as it was in the original series, and if it existed in a pocket of non-space, then it probably could also go through several billion years of evolution from the time that the original enterprise ""Ran into it"", to the time of this encounter.The one thing I realize and I apologize for having to make this a spoiler, is that Haskell was probably just another illusion of Nigilum's, he appears suddenly on the bridge, gets ""killed"" by Nigilum, and then just as suddenly disappears: you will note that nobody mentions Haskell ever again in this episode or at any other time. And, as soon as Haskell is dead, Wesley appears sitting at his station, as if he were there through the whole incident. They never show him getting up to leave, why would Wesley leave, unless it was a shift-change? So then, why would Wesley suddenly be back at the helm, a different officer would probably have been assigned instead. So that makes me feel better- nobody really died in this episode. Nigilum already knew what existence was, he just wanted to did hear what Picard had to say about it. So he sends his replicas of Troy and Data into Picards' waiting room, to hear what was one of the most profound monologues about existence from Picard I have ever heard.But my theory, this theory: this was the original entity that the original enterprise blew up in the original series. But, it survived, evolved, and this is its revenge on the Federation for almost blowing it up. He was just screwing with the enterprise crew. Because nobody realized in the original series think they could've just left that thing alone, it wasn't really in the same space time continuum him as our galaxy is.",10

Once the Enterprise is pulled into the entity so it can learn about Picard and crew, about death, they decide to do the unthinkable - self-destruction. As a trivia note, originally the producers wanted Richard Mulligan (of the series ""Empty Nest"") but he wasn't available - but as an homage, they named the entity in this episode as Nagilum (Muligan backwards!). We also see another Galaxy class starship, the Yamato, as well as an homage to Jerry Goldsmith's Klingon Theme at the beginning of the episode when Worf shares his Klingon calisthenics program with Riker  you get to see Worf's Klingon instincts (such as anger) again here.",
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Where Silence Has Lease (TV Episode 1988)",The Tone Of The Original 1966 Series Is In Place,"The Enterprise encounters a void in space.One of my very favourite second season episodes as it has a nice story mostly set on the bridge and we get some wonderful lines of dialogue from the Captain, the ship's Doctor (Diana Muldaur) and the mysterious creature.I know I am in the minority around here, but I actually think that Muldaur is the best TNG Doctor as she gets some wonderful put-down lines to Data...even calling him ""it"" at one point.

3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Where Silence Has Lease (TV Episode 1988)",Was This More Dumb Luck or a Truly Clever Play?,"The whole setup for this episode is quite good. We have a mysterious void in space where the Enterprise finds itself buried. Since there is nothing on the sensors, there is no escaping it. Add to this, the illusions of a Romulan battle cruiser that actually fires on the ship and a federation starship which has no crew. It is obvious something is toying with the crew. Soon a sort of cat-like face appears on the screen. It is the chosen representation of an alien force that sees the Enterprise as a mere curiosity. It has no respect or concern for the crew. It even kills a bridge officer to watch him die. It is hard to enjoy an episode when the forces working against the crew are so unfathomable that there is no strategy to counteract them. The best Picard can do is to destroy the ship. He and Riker initiate the destruct sequence. The crew gets twenty minutes to get its affairs in order. The entity continues to toy with them. I guess saying enough is enough is the last resort for Picard. Still, the universe is so complex and the villains are around every corner (are there corners?). This episode is clever and dramatic and does keep our attention. Perhaps that's all we can ask for.",7

The Enterprise later investigates an unusual anomaly in space and end up being drawn into a wicked plan by a malevolent entity who wishes to toy with the lives of the Enterprise crew. Picard is aghast when the being, now identified as Nagilum kills a crew member to see someone dying as it is an experience unknown to it. As a show of defiance by Picard, he decides to destroy Enterprise rather than let Nagilum kill the crew to satisfy it's own curiosity. After this Nagilum departs as it's needs cannot be satisfied. Picard deactivates the auto destruct and the bridge crew breath a sigh of relief. Picard later faces Nagilum on his monitor in his Ready Room and tells it plainly if the Enterprise encounters it again it will be in space and under his terms.

5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Where Silence Has Lease (TV Episode 1988)",Star Trek TNG- Where Silence Has Lease,"""Why do I get the feeling this was not the right time to join this ship?""I have mixed feelings about ""Where Silence Has Lease"". I think the episode, before the threat's ""face"" is revealed, is absolutely fascinating. The Enterprise crew encounter a mysterious void, absent dimension and has no readings on Data or Wesley's monitor--it seems to exist, yet doesn't provide any readings to prove that it is a ""lifeform"". Worf mentions the Klingon myth of a space creature that devours starships and could not be too far from the truth. Anyway, the Enterprise decides to ""take a closer look"" with the void ""enveloping"" the ship! So the next thirty minutes has Picard strategizing as to what the void is. The appearance of a Romulan vessel, instantly attacking (and destroyed after return torpedo way too easily), the presence of the USS Yamato (replicated but not exactly the same ship, not operated by a crew, as Riker and Work board it noticing that the bridge and other locations are ""off""), and the inability to exit the void despite warp speed to the max, each incident further perplexes Picard and crew, growing more concerned until the void finally shows its face (eyes, nose, and mouth, looking like a cartoon character, not menacing at all) and speaks perfect English. Deanna Troi and Dr. Pulaski feel that the Enterprise crew is like a rat in a maze, a laboratory experiment, their lives inconsequential to the Nagilum (that is what this void calls itself). When a member of the crew is killed by the Nagilum, interested in seeing death first hand, coldly/clinically determining that it will experiment with murder for over 50% of the Enterprise, Picard will decide to self destruct the starship instead of watching as the creature slaughters his crew. How will Picard get his people out of this situation? To be honest, once I saw the Nagilum for the first time, I was taken right out of the episode. It looks too silly for serious science fiction, something a child doodles on paper out of boredom during math in the third grade elementary. The idea of a void, a kind of ""hole in space"", simply engulfing sensor probes sent into it instantly, with the ability to duplicate ships, containing a degree of superior intelligence, not known through any historical text, Data unable to define what it is, offers a really fascinating story, yet with one visible image of the void's face totally diminishing the results of such a compelling developing plot. That said, I was gripped by this episode for a good duration. The Nagilum wanting to learn about the Enterprise crew, seeing what they would do when faced with a number of tests, disappointed with its findings, even using the likeness of Troi and Data, at one point, to ask Picard about the meaning of death, ""Where Silence Has Lease"" definitely has an alien entity perfectly identifiable in the Trek universe. Aliens have shown up during the many Trek series wanting to learn about us, often using experimentation as a means to gain knowledge about how humans handle a crisis or difficult, perilous ordeal. I don't imagine this episode, however, will be viewed by Trek TNG fans as a particularly memorable episode, which is a shame because it initially had a lot of potential. Funny, many might remember the hologram program where Worf introduces Riker to a battle program (he calls it ""calisthenics""!) he spends time in during his off-hours! This is significant in that Riker and Worf board the replica Yamato and we again see how the latter responds under duress, with his Klingon half surfacing possibly to his detriment (during the hologram exercise, Worf, so worked up, almost attacks Riker!).",6

immediately lose all navigational bearings. Fortunately they are commanded by
Jean Luc Picard who does not lose his cool easily. Imagine had Worf been in
charge and we see it almost happen when he and Riker are put into a maze like
situation.Which is what Patrick Stewart grasps soon enough. It seems as though the 
Enterprise has ventured into the realm of some god-like creature, but one who
has not done any creating. So Nagillum as it calls itself is looking to find out
about these creatures who have entered his domain.A thought provoking story, not one of the better ones though.",5

When they get near it to investigate this further, the ship is enveloped by the complete blackness and unable to escape no matter what speed they put the Enterprise at. After fighting an illusionary Romulans vessel, the Enterprise encounters its sister ship, the USS Yamato. Worf and Riker beam aboard and find it to be abandoned and not the true Yamato. There are multiple bridges and other weird happenings. Worf loses his cool and the lair beam back.Right about now is when Picard discover this nothingness has a name: Nagilum. This being wants to study humanity and our concept of death. It kills a red shirt and said it plans on killing more in its studies. To prevent this, Picard and Riker set the Enterprise to self-destruct and not give Nagilum the satisfaction or power to finish its lab experiment. Nagilum tries to trick Picard into canceling the order by taking the forms of Data and Troi but Picard doesn't fall for it and Nagilum allows the Enterprise to leave. They cancel the self-destruct sequence at the last second and head off for a new adventure.This episode is a bit on the slower side but this script is a step in the right direction for the show at large. We get some real exploration here and a solid since of direction from Winrich Kolbe. The all-powerful god-like figure is really played out by this point but at least in this instance Nagilum doesn't show up until the episode is practically over. The void is the thing here that takes center stage, that and the trip to the Yamato.It's not the greatest TNG episode ever but after some of the Season 1 episodes and the first ep of Season 2, this one feels like a breath of fresh air.",6

This is just another example of the superior species test of humans/Vulcans/Klingons. We don't learn much new from this one.1. Humans still don't pick up any new technology tips, after all of these exposures. 2. You would think they would look for an alliance with one of these super duper species. 3.

So, they go in for a closer look and get stuck within. The laws of physics simply stop applying and the ship's movement results in no change in heading. Later, other ships appear and all seem to be 'phantom ships'--with no crew. When Riker and Worf beam over to one, the ship completely defies all physical laws--having multiple bridges and it all ends up being like a hall of mirrors with no exit. And, when exits appear in the cloud, they quickly seal up! None of this makes any sense and the cloud is behaving as if it's alive and jerking them around! What gives? Will they be stuck there forever?After a long and fruitless search for a real way out, suddenly a giant face appears in the cloud and begins talking to them--asking questions about a wide variety of things. Then, it begins treating the crew much like lab rats--and even kills one. In fact, it announces that it's going to kill many more--at which point the Captain decides that it's best to self-destruct than put up with this. What's next?While this episode is interesting, it's also a bit claustrophobic-- with the crew being stuck mostly on the bridge for the entire episode.

As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 02With new smart ideas, compelling dramatic pieces and ethical dilemmas that makes you think twice, the second round of this enterprise crew is surely an improvement where more diversity and maturity is visible.Where Silence Has LeaveThe physical sequences have definitely up the game and so is the spookiness of an alienated subject which covers up the first half, and even though the rest of episode fails on living up to the expectations, Picard's definition of death ought to be and will be cathartic.",

I think Qanqor's review of this episode implies that he missed the point of what it was supposed to be. There needed to be an episode that wasn't so dark. They had just lost Yar.Also no. The computer was locked out by Moriarity himself. When the system created him, it created him to be smart enough to defeat Data. The computer gace Moriarity the knowledge of the entire ship. Along with any knowledge that was present in the system itself. He overrode the system.(You honestly would have known that if you got halfway through. And at the end, he is the one that cancels the override)And no. They could not have destroyed the Holodeck, they had explained that doing so would destroy Palaski.Despite all those things. Even if they could just destroy the holodeck. The whole purpose of the episode was to solve a mystery. It was to challenge one's mind. Not use brute force to accomplish something.",8

This episode revisits Data's fascination with Sherlock Holmes which we first see in the first season. It's also interesting to note that even a Holodeck environment can be used dangerously if one is not careful because La Forge was able to create an adversary greater than ""Data"", or as Picard describes it, his ""Nemesis."" And, it's a riot to see Worf dressed up in 19th century London garb complete with gloves! This is one of the better TNG episodes.",
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Elementary, Dear Data (TV Episode 1988)",this is wonderful!,"A lot of the loose threads are left for other episodes. I'm not just referring to ship in a bottle, but also to measure of a man. Admittedly it bugged me when the Issue of Data's computer-like intelligence, which was the catalyst for the doctor's challenge and thus for the main problem, was not answered but one would need an entire episode at least to answer it and that is given to them about 6 episodes later.For now Moriarty is a great villain and well performed by Daniel Davis. The entire episode has a metaphysical plot-hole the size of this continent but hey, Star Trek IS metaphysical! watch the above named episodes to get a sense of fulfillment to the issues raised. There are a few minor errors but this episode is amusing, intriguing, silly and classic all at once. Of how many episodes can that truly be said ? 4 or 5 stars.",7
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Elementary, Dear Data (TV Episode 1988)",Brent Spiner vs Daniel Davis,"This is where The Next Generation really started increasing in Quality.In Season 2, the addition of Guinan booted TNG in the rear-Every Starship should have a Bartender- And the replacement of Dr Crusher with an actor that really did well portraying a Doctor - It is just ""Elementary"" that the show got better.The series saw an immediate increase in quality the moment they removed Tasha Yar: and I am glad that they Vindicated that character in the episode ""Yesterday's Enterprise""-But in Season One, the series was still being controlled by old-school personalities like David Gerrold, Dorothy C. Fontana, Gene Roddenberry and Bjo Trimble, who although being experts in the Kirk Era of Trek, had trouble writing for a 'Next Generation' - Including Gene, who had no direction for this series.And So, Beverly Crusher was replaced by Dr Katherine Polaski, who was almost as good as Dr McCoy, she was a female version of McCoy-Including Acerbic Tongue.But this episode, really gets into the relationship of Geordi and Data. Geordi wants to have an adventure, which Data ruins by his excessive knowledge of everything. No Mystery, No FUN. So Geordi tells the Computer, ""Create a Villain that can defeat DATA.""This wonderful bit of FUN allows the creation of Daniel Davis' Dr Moriarty: An Intelligent Holodeck Character.Dr Polaski, she just wants to Prove that Data can't pull off any kind of creative thinking, so they all meet in ""London"" and immediately, Moriarty ""Kidnaps"" Polaski, who he ""Crams full of Crumpets""- This is one thing that should have been pursued, Moriarty's attraction to Polaski- That could have been exploited in another episode. But Polaski did not stay on the Enterprise very long.This episode set the standard for TNG Holodeck episodes, Brent Spiner throws himself into Data's ""Sherlock Holmes""- And Geordi, No Longer the misplaced Kunta Kintu of Trek, is now the Chief Engineer- Where he should have been from the Beginning, instead of about four Chief Engineers they had before him.But what makes this episode, is Daniel Davis' Interaction with Data, Polaski and then Picard. I've seen Davis playing all kinds of roles, this one is one of his best.",10
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Elementary, Dear Data (TV Episode 1988)",Anything but elementary,"This episode proved so popular that 5 years later the Professor Moriarty character
who Daniel Davis plays here was brought back for a sequel. It is a very thought
provoking story on the mystery of life and creation.Seeking a little R&R both Brent Spiner and LeVar Burton go to the Holodeck where Data has a Sherlock Holmes program with Geordi as Dr. Watson. The
program is a bust since Data has read and memorized all of Arthur Conan Doyle's
work and he cuts right to the chase.What to do but to have the ship's computer design a program with a foe who
is capable of beating the android. That it does, but Professor Moriarty works
only too well and soon he's got control of the ship from the Holodeck.At that point it's Captain Picard who has to take charge of the situation and
defeat a Moriarty who is rapidly acquiring knowledge up to the present time.Like any other creature with a sense of self, Moriarty wants to survive. You'll
have to see how this is worked out and as TNG fans know it's not a permanent

5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Elementary, Dear Data (TV Episode 1988)",One step closer to the TNG we know and love,"'Elementary, Dear Data' may be a holodeck episode (and I honestly didn't expect all that much walking in), but it's one that refreshingly sees TNG up its game. This time around, it's Data and Geordi in a Sherlock Holmes mystery and Moriarty winds up taking over the ship. Not complicated, but I did like the big question being asked here: can a computer be alive? Dr. Pulaski spends a good deal of time haranguing Data for not being able to reason like real people (geez, this woman), while Moriarty yearns to learn more about the ship, stretch beyond his simulation limits and (more importantly) doesn't want his program being erased. But the situation is handled more thoughtfully than expected with Capt. Picard (in sweet top hat) brokering an understanding between the two.All in all, a great episode; the wardrobe and sets are well done and you can tell Brent Spiner loves this Holmes stuff. More importantly, this actually feels like TNG: the characters feel right, Picard's actually softening, and everything's clicking.9/10",9
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Elementary, Dear Data (TV Episode 1988)","Elementary, Dear Data","Because Data has read all of the Sherlock Holmes stories, every detail memorized, even able to play the superior sleuth's violin flawlessly, Geordi is frustrated because he wanted to help him solve a holographic mystery (Geordi would be portraying Dr. Watson to Data's Holmes) together. Dr. Pulaski feels that because he's a walking machine, his circuits would short if asked to deduce and risk failure against a capable opponent (a human quality he doesn't have). Geordi and Data decide to try to create a mystery with an opponent capable enough to offer a challenge, but instead of asking the computer to give them a villain able to defeat Holmes, he asks to provide one that can defeat Data. So the computer provides master criminal Moriarty with a consciousness and he can actually call for the holographic arch, eventually learning of how to control the Enterprise, overriding protocols that would end the program and kill him upon command, building a device with a lever that can shake the ship. Picard will have to have a talk with him. I love episodes where we see the hologram involved in stories because they seem to often involve complex challenges Picard and his officers must solve. This is a marvelous episode for actor Daniel Davis, as Moriarty, exuding a mixture of child-like wonder and determined focus on maintaining his existence. It is neat because we see a fictional, created character aware of the very system and people who led to his creation. He wants to live, knows he has an intelligence beyond the basics of his holographic design, and is willing to threaten the Enterprise in order to *not die*, to not *cease to exist*. I really like how Picard handles Moriarty's fate and this episode, ""Elementary, Dear Data"", one of the series most memorable episodes, and a standout from the second season, leaves open the opportunity for the character to return (and does in ""Ship in the Bottle""). Good way for Pulaski to get involved, she once again ""insults"" Data, believing he's a machine, not able to truly rise beyond how he was programmed. The original Victory, a well-constructed oceanic model ship, built by Geordi as a gift to a former captain, makes a welcome appearance, recalling *simpler times* when man had to use the environment and their own intuition to guide through the seas, preparing for whatever challenges might await them, only counting on each other to get to the desired destination. There are plot ""deficiencies* in regards to the ability of energy turned matter to leave the holodeck, but it wasn't that big a deal to me as it might be for nitpicky folks who demand perfection in regards to science. Holmes, the character, and London, are featured favorably here and if you love the stories, the show lovingly establishes their importance in history.",8
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Elementary, Dear Data (TV Episode 1988)",Bring your truck,"While this is a superficially enjoyable episode, it is deeply flawed. Specifically, you might as well bring your truck to this episode, because you'll be able to drive it through the plot holes.We reach a point where the crisis is that the holodeck Moriarty character has somehow become sentient and taken over control of the holodeck, and is holding Dr. Pulaski hostage within his holodeck-London world. We presume that the holodeck safeties have been disabled and the good doctor is in real peril (notice that nobody actually bothers to check). Data is unable to shut down the program; the computer announces that this is because it is locked under authority of-- Geordi.The problem is, there are about a thousand different ways our heroes could easily and safely rescue the doctor. These, then, are the plot holes: 1a) As the goofs for this episode points out, the program is locked to Geordi. So Geordi should be able to unlock it, no prob. He doesn't even try.1b) Data outranks Geordi. So he should be able to override Geordi's lockout.1c) If nothing else, surely *Captain Picard* has the authority to override any computer lockout set by someone under him.2) Why not just shut off the holodeck. Not ask the computer to shut it down, but shut it down yourself. Is Geordi an engineer or not? It's just a friggin' device in the end. Pull the power cord! Open the thing up and take out key circuits. Shut down the engines so there's no power for it to draw. Shut down the whole computer! (why not? they've done it before). Or just take an axe to all the holodeck equipment.2b) You could also destroy the holodeck from the inside. There have to be emitters that create all the stuff in the holodeck. And engineering has the schematics to know exactly where they are located. Data could just go in with a hand phaser and quickly shoot out all the emitters. Boom, no more holographic projection, just an empty holodeck room with Dr. Pulaski standing in it somewhere.3) Or how about something a zillion times simpler: Just beam her out of there! Duh! They know she's in the holodeck room, the computer even knows she's there (presumably based on her comm badge), the sensors can easily pick her out as the only life form in the room. Piece of cake to just transport her out!Well, you get the idea. The conundrum is ridiculously contrived. And we haven't even *begun* to talk about the preposterous notion that the ship's computer could create sentience, just by someone asking it to. Pity that Dr. Soong wasted so much of his life designing Data's amazingly complex positronic brain, when all he had to do was just ask a regular computer to create sentience.",4

He figures out how to override the controls and is soon in total control of the holodeck and altering the ship somehow. Picard must enter the holodeck and negotiate with Moriarty to release the kidnapped Pulaski and give control of the ship back to the crew.Data as Sherlock Holmes amuses me. I can't tell if Brent Spiner is bad at playing Data as Sherlock Holmes or if Data is just bad at playing as Sherlock Holmes but either way I find it funny. I like when Data and Geordi bro out like this.The holodeck gets made fun of a lot as an overly powerful, dangerous tool that has no business being on a starship and this episode is case in point. The computer creates AI through Moriarty that is so smart and dangerous that it threatens the crew's very existence! One small slip up in instructions from Geordi cause all this to fall apart. The holodeck is like having a 800 pound gorilla in a cage on the Enterprise. Sure, it's probably fine most of the time and might even give the crew some entertainment... but the risks are way too high to justify it!Anyways, we get to see a bit of Picard's great negotiating powers here. Kirk would have just beat Moriarty up but Picard uses tact and intelligence to regain control. Something tells me this won't be the last we see of this Moriarty character...",7

Well, I don't see it. After all, it's a holodeck episode and to me these particular plots are very unsatisfying and contrived. And, as a fan of Sherlock Holmes, I take no pleasure in seeing these characters brought into the annoying holodeck. In this case, Geordi and Data are playing Sherlock Holmes on the holodeck. However, the program is taken directly from an original story--and Data has memorized EVERYTHING--making the fantasy a complete waste of time. Geordi and the Doctor challenge Data to star in a NEW Holmes mystery--one that the computer could create. In it, their nemesis is Moriarty* and through some strange programming, this character gains sentience and eventually figured out that he was a hologram as well as how to access the control panel and computer!I found this episode insufferable. The show had practically nothing to do with ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""--and seemed amazingly misplaced. Additionally, while it's not as awful as the baseball game episode from ""Deep Space 9"", I found it very tough going sticking with this one. As a fan of Holmes and sci-fi, the episode really didn't satisfy either.*Although it's practically a cliché to feature Moriarty, he was NOT a frequent character in the original Holmes novels and only appeared on a very occasional basis. The same can be said for Lestrade--who is only one of many policemen who Holmes works with in the original stories.",3

It is, without a doubt, the most complex of entities, going beyond the realm of current possibilities. For one thing, it is more than holographic. The people can be touched, the chairs sat in, the fog felt, and so on. Also, there are some possibilities that only the mind can envision. With the huge crew, there never seems to be a problem with crew members signing up for this thing. I believe there are two on the ship. Do only ranking officers get to use it? I know that in the future, little children are allowed in there. Anyway, it is fact, but there is little information about how it came to be (at least I haven't seen it yet). Back to the episode. Data has a thing for Sherlock Holmes and has created a program where he and Geordi (his Watson) encounter the villains from the Holmes canon. To Geordi's dismay, Data solves the crimes immediately, since he already knows the plot of the story. Geordi and Polaski talk him into allowing them to create a program where he has no idea what is going to happen. Geordi makes a terrible mistake when he asks that a character be created that could defeat ""Data"" rather than that could defeat ""Holmes."" This brings the great Moriarity to life and puts the ship and its crew in danger. The Holodeck seems to be able to create such an entity which would make it rather a dangerous thing, out of the hands of the crew. There are two issues at stake. The very life of the ship and Moriarity's mortality which comes into play. The final scene is a little too easy, but it gives us a thoughtful look at what constitutes a life form, which brings the prime directive into play. Picard goes about his business on a day to day basis, as crew members come and go in the Holodeck. It makes one wonder if some safeguards might be put in place after this episode.",8

I recently watched it again just to remind me why. I've always considered this the worst ST:TNG episode (with the exception of ""Shades of Gray,"" which barely counts as an episode at all).I keep listening to the clunky dialogue and thinking of the script red-penciled by the author's Writing 101 teacher: ""SHOW, DON'T TELL!"" From Deanna Troi's pronouncement, and everyone else's constant elbowing reminders about what a charming, dangerous rogue Okona is, to Guinan's explanation about how funny her droid joke is (it isn't), to the who-cares resolution to the conflict, there isn't a plot point that isn't highlighted and triple-underlined for our edification, and there ain't a believable moment in any of it. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is too puppy-dog huggable to be the center of the machinations of the plot. On the other hand, it could be that no one short of John Barrowman (Jack Harkness from ""Doctor Who"") could pull of this underwritten placeholder of a role.(Zero points, by the way, to the Data subplot. While I think Joe Piscopo stopped being funny decades ago, he and Brent Spiner had nothing to work with here. Although the Jerry Lewis bit was funny in a stupid way.)On a good day, you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to a lesser Original Series episode.

However, there really isn't a lot that is funny here--and that's odd since that seems to be the purpose of this episode.When the episode begins, Captain Okana is having engine problems with his run-down old freighter. The Enterprise, always eager to please and establish contact with various races, offers to help. However, it will take some time and so Okana comes over to the Enterprise to relax, look around and score with as many women as is humanly possible!! By the end of the episode, however, Okana's roguish ways come back to haunt him, as his reputation in this part of space is less than stellar.The other main plot involves Data. As always, he's trying to get in touch with what it's like to be human. In this case, he's investigating humor and enlists the help of an unnamed holodeck comic (Joe Piscopo) to give him pointers. The problem is that it all comes off as VERY rehearsed and the jokes are exceptionally corny. Guinan tries to help. Oddly, while this portion has to do with humor, NOTHING about it made me smile or laugh and was by far the weakest aspect of the episode.Overall, not a lot to this one. Pleasant and engaging at best...a bit of a waste of time, perhaps, as well.",5

To this end, he creates a Holodeck Facsimile of a 20th Century Comedian: Joe Piscopo, who tries to instruct him in the fine art of making people Laugh. But Data fails to grasp any of it, which in turn makes this one of the most hilarious episodes of ST:TNG. There is a classic meeting between ""Guinan"" (Whoopee Goldberg) and Piscopo, where she asks him, ""You made a Living doing this?"" - Irony is one of the best forms of Humour, which this episode uses in all of the little vignettes being played out.One small spaceship appears and starts locking Lasers on the Enterprise, which would not do much. Then another craft appears from the other side of the system, and does the same thing: But they both want Okona. As the second ship appears, Worf mumbles: ""Another Globfly"" and Picard has to shut Data up before he expounds just what a Globfly is for two hours.Okona of course is being pursued by the leaders of the two planets, he is accused of stealing a priceless gem from one planet, and impregnating a Princess on the other. The Princess is Rosalind Allen (From SeaQuest DSV). On the other side, is ""Prince"" Benzan (Kieran Mulroney, writer of ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"")-whose father is chasing Okona because he stole some ""National Treasure.""Okona initially takes refuge in Picard's Hospitality, but when the two opposing ships appear, Picard has to ask him if he had an ulterior motive for coming on-board (Other than seducing three different Enterprise Crew Women).But the two leaders both want Okona's head, he has to choose which ship to be beamed to, Okona chooses to agree to a shotgun wedding with Yanar (Allen). When Benzan Objects to this, the truth comes out: The two leaders cannot get along, but their children have gotten along just fine, producing a child!As the situation changes from the threat of the two leaders fighting, to the two leaders arguing about which planet the couple will get married on, the threat diffuses, and Okona can go on his way, leaving Data with some memorable studies in Humor: To which Guinan states: ""To be funny is not the end all or be-all of being Human"" but Data disagrees, as he sees nothing more Uniquely Human than to be Funny.

Not much sci-fi here.As another poster noted, it is too bad that Okono did not return to the series every so often, like Harry Mudd, as he would have given us some welcome laughs.

I get that this is supposed to be one of those think pieces that delves into what differentiates an android from a human but it's just so poorly done. Joe Piscopo's presence doesn't help things.The Okona character isn't much better. He's the uber-stereotype of a renegade space man: on a broken down ship, seducing all the females aboard, charming all the men. It's just a bit much. Even the plot twist at the end felt very cliqued.

As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily.

The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table.

0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Loud as a Whisper (TV Episode 1989)",An interesting attempt at inclusion.,"This episode features a character, Riva, who is a peace negotiator-- even though he is deaf. For his language, he used three interpreters who all represent different aspect of him. Unusual to say the least. However, when these three interpreters are accidentally murdered, the peace treaty that Riva is trying to negotiate looks like it's out of the question. What's next in this highly unusual show.Most folks wouldn't know this, but ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" was actually one of the first TV shows that was closed captioned. The captioning wasn't always great back in the late 1980s, but they deserve recognition for trying. Fortunately, the newer captions included with the shows on Netflix are exceptional and very easy to read--and we use them in our home. This is because my youngest daughter is deaf--and we both sat down and watched this particular episode together. Hannah is not a regular viewer of the show but I wanted her insights. Mostly, she was just surprised how long ago this show was made, as she had assumed that deaf awareness was a much more recent issue. She also greatly appreciated the effort to make deaf people a part of any TV show.A few things we noticed. Data's sign language is mostly gibberish, but the deaf actor Howie Seago was using American Sign Language--and my daughter laughed at that the same way we laugh when all the aliens just instantly know English in most sci-fi shows! Seago was very easy to read--especially for a non-deaf signer like me. What I noticed is that OFTEN when Data was interpreting, he was saying things BEFORE Riva (Seago) even said them!! Oops! Not perfect--- but I do appreciate the effort nonetheless. Overall, an extremely interesting episode and a great opportunity to include deaf people in a mainstream TV show. Worth seeing.",8
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Loud as a Whisper (TV Episode 1989)",Loud as a Whisper,"""Loud as a Whisper"" comments on disability and how one comes to terms with the loss of one sense, turning a disadvantage into an advantage. Loss seems to be a major emotion that speaks dramatically and thematically in this episode about two factions of Solari people on a planet called Solais, both warring with each other for centuries, on the verge of extinction, reaching out, however reluctantly, to renowned, reputed peachmaker Riva (it is made known in a scene with Worf, in the transporter room when he feels certain unease, brought to light by Troi, that Riva was responsible for peace talks between the Federation and Klingon). Riva is deaf and has a ""chorus"" of individuals who work in concert as his thoughts, feelings, words to others and a tragedy involving one out-of-control Solari warrior shakes the confidant mediator's resolve and belief in his abilities to end war/conflict, placing an incredible strain on Capt Picard and his crew. The idea that one man, with help from a highly trained, and well in-tune, accompaniment, can end centuries of war is certainly fascinating, understanding his methods will be of focus in this episode as Deanna Troi (who Riva has become profoundly moved by) tries to change his mind when the senseless murder of his chorus may potentially halt Riva's desire to stop the possible slaughter of an entire world's populace. I love this final scene where a relieved Picard thanks Troi for her work with Riva; it is a moment where her importance to him is celebrated/applauded. A fascinating development involving Geordi's eyesight is also featured as Dr. Pulaski offers to perform surgery and perhaps give him the ability to see, although straight-forward that it is not for certain that it will work. I thought Howie Seago was extraordinary as the deaf, mute Riva and his scenes with Troi are the heart and soul of this episode's story. The death of Riva's chorus is shocking and horrifying, as it should be to drive home the point that it will not be easy to settle the ongoing, personal war between these people. I love how this episode incorporates the theme of deafness as it relates to the crew's difficulty with him once his entourage is killed. And Data's learning of the sign language also adds much to this wonderful episode. ""Loud as a Whisper"" is yet another nice discovery as I make my way through the early seasons of The Next Generation.",9

He has 3 people who communicate for him hearing his thoughts and then verbally expressing them (his Chorus). We also get to see how he handles himself without his 3 translators once they are killed. An interesting episode which brings to the surface the issue of deafness including sign language (which Data must learn to help communicate with Riva directly).

And to top it off, one of the people who was vaporized was Marnie Mossman, Q's (John DeLancey's) wife.The issue here, is that we have a federation negotiator who has developed a unique way of communication. But unfortunately he is a little bit too self-confident, confidence that gets knocked down when something unexpected happens.But an amazing thing occurs at that time, the negotiator is shown as a real person, Who can still do his job even with the handicap he is given back after the incident. But what is most important is that it takes Troy and Data to show this man that he can still do what he needs to do.After all, this is one of the men that helped negotiate the peace between the Federation and the Klingon Empire. If he has Worf's respect, then his reputation for 100% success has been wholly deserved. This episode shows that even the most successful people can have reversals set up on them but that they can still function and do what they need to do even in the midst of that. One of the most difficult things to deal with is Deafness, this man was born deaf and mute, but he developed a chorus that allowed him to communicate. In a way, this man was carting around a miniature royal court. Well, we have seen through history that even Royals are human beings and have their own difficulties.The man who had boarded the enterprise was blustery and confident, the man left standing on the hilltop at the end of the episode was to same man, he had taken his disadvantage and turned it into an advantage.",10

The landing party barely makes it back to the ship. Now its time to pout. Riva, who has never lost a negotiation, takes his ball and is ready to go home. Troi has been the one to connect with him during all this because of her empathic powers. She is designated to do his job. The conclusion is quite non-surprising.

The one oddity about Riva is that he is deaf and uses a trio of mindreaders who give emotion to his thoughts. Riva feels a connection to Troi since she is an empath and understands him on some level.The away team plus Riva and his crew beam down to the negotiation site. One of the factions has an usurper in its midst not ready for peace who shoots and kills Riva's interpreters with his phaser. The rest beam back up to regroup. Data learns Riva's language so he can interpret. Riva wants to give up but Troi is able to motivate him to try again. Riva decides to beam down to the surface and face the two factions by himself. He will teach them how to sign in his language and then teach them all his wisdom that he has on peace and prosperity. It may take a while but then again, creating a peace pact for a centuries old war is not something that can occur overnight.This episode is a bit strange in my opinion. It really focuses on this Deaf Jesus fellow they call Riva. He comes in a bit too cocky and is quickly shown his place when his team is cut down. If it were up to Worf there would have been a security team there protecting them. My favorite part of this though is that the man who played Riva actually is a deaf actor. It's super cool that they were able to include him in this episode, a nice little touch by the casting director.But the actualy storyline to this is fairly middle of the road. We've already had multiple ""transporting negotiator"" episodes and we're barely into Season 2 here! There's no real B plot here unless you count the half-baked one they drum up about Geordi's eyesite and possibly giving him real eyes. This is ground we've already tread a bit in a previous episode with Q but I guess we're giving it another shot here?

He has a masterful scientist, actually being the mentor of Data's creator, Dr. Soong. Unfortunately, his great career is about to end. He has an incurable disease that is fatal. In a comic, but touching scene, the old man insists that date refer to him as ""Grandpa."" They talk for long periods of time. The acerbic old goat is condescending and sarcastic and will not go gentle into that good night. He refuses to recognize the illness but it has obviously taken a foothold in his body. Things get interesting when Graves dies and his demise is announced by Data. From this point forward, Data changes completely. He becomes an android Graves. A hilarious scene is when they have the burial service and Data delivers a eulogy that is hilarious. However, the new android/Graves begins to become dangerous and could also be compromising Data's programming. Violence begins to dominate, not the seeking for knowledge that Grave's imagined, particularly when it comes to a young woman that he has raised and loved his whole life (a May/September situation). This whole episode is played with aplomb and is very entertaining.",9

Graves is dying and in an act of desperation and love, he transfers himself into Data, thereby creating a ""shizoid man"", Data now having two personalities (himself and Graves). You get to see Brent Spiner having fun here as Data, because he gets to portray more human feelings than is otherwise possible - including with a beard! Also, Suzie Plakson makes an appearance as Dr. Selar - although she will never be seen on screen again, she is mentioned quite a lot as the series progresses (also the actor will portray many Star Trek characters including Federation-Klingon Liaison K'Ehleyr in TNG, as well as the Female Q in Voyager and Tarah in Enterprise).",

4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Schizoid Man (TV Episode 1989)",Definitely one of the better Next Generation episodes - great comedy,"Data gets ""possessed"" by a brilliant scientist, and hilarity ensues.Actually, it's the proper blend of hilarity with a convincing amount of creepiness. I've never laughed harder at Next Generation than at the scene in which the possessed Data lavishes excessive praise on the recently deceased scientist during his eulogy. Brent Spiner does a superb job in this one. During his long career as Data, he seemed to nail the character's comedic aspects better than his stodgy, stiff aspects.I also loved my introduction to the gorgeous Barbara Alyn Woods, whose career is apparently in decline in recent years. But she had a much better run than the majority of the other minor players who have appeared in this series.",8
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Schizoid Man (TV Episode 1989)",The Schizoid Man,"Here is a bonafide ""Jekyll/Hyde"" episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation where the great William Morgan Sheppard makes the most of his ten or so minutes as Dr. Ira Graves, a renowned scientific mind working on bridging the gap between human and machine, dying of a painful disease that will kill him in a manner of hours. He is secretly in love with his assistant, the much younger, and adorable Kareen Brianon (Barbara Alyn Woods), and has discovered a way not only to incorporate his knowledge but his whole personality, the entire self into cybernetic form, ""stealing"" Data's body for his own! This episode allows Brent Spiner (Data) to really mimic and portray the character conveyed by Sheppard during his limited time on screen. I imagine that was a joy for Spiner, too, really being able to inflict Graves' persona on an Enterprise crew not prepared for it. Graves may be a genius, but he's riddled with arrogance and self-congratulation, admiring his intellect and superiority towards most opposite him because of his heralded intelligence. But his Achilles Heel is Kareen and while being able to take control of Data's body, his own personality becomes a detriment and the power he now is in charge of could be Graves' very downfall. Accidentally fracturing Kareen's hand with a grip out of anger because she wants no part of being transferred into an android body, Graves is ill-equipped to continue on inside the body of Data. Suzie Plakson has a guest role as Vulcan Medical Doctor, Lt. Selar, the one who diagnosed Graves' condition. Sheppard really shows us the agony his character experiences and certainly leaves a distinct impression of his character; it allows us to get a feel for who he is so when the real Graves leaves and Data takes his place, you know that the personality has changed. The use of ""If I Only Had a Heart"" from Wizard of Oz is especially noteworthy as it pertains to the personality change. Seeing Data and Picard at odds with each other makes for great dramatics. This episode is fun, and it is a good progression of the Data character arc of his desire to be human. The scene with Data wearing a beard should earn quite a few laughs.",7
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Schizoid Man (TV Episode 1989)",24th Century Schizoid Man!,"This excellent Episode has the great character actor W. Morgan Shepherd (Mostly known for his small role in Max Headroom and as the Klingon warden of Rura Pente Prison in Star Trek VI who spouts the ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" Speech to Kirk and McCoy) as Dr. Ira Graves, the Robotics specialist who had taught Data's Creator, Dr. Noonian Soong.The Enterprise sends an Away Team to his planet while they warp out to a nearby emergency, this is the first (and only) time they use a ""Near-Warp Transport."" Data, Troi and the Vulcan ""Dr Selar"" (Played by Suzie Plakson before she appears as Key'lehr later in this season) are almost ""Beamed into a Stone Wall."" Graves won't let Selar use a medical tricorder on him, but he is distracted by Data, who gives him a sharp turn, in turn giving Selar the opportunity to sneak up from behind and scan him. Graves has a terminal degenerative disease and has not much time.Graves has been snapping at his associate, Kareen (Barbara Alyn Woods from ""One Tree Hill""), and she send the emergency broadcast because of it. Because Graves is considered the ""Greatest Living Mind"" by the Federation, they were compelled to respond.While they wait for the Enterprise to return, Graves spends most of his remaining time with Data, and as he had taught Data's ""Father"" Dr Soong ""All he knew,"" he tells Data ""This makes me your Grandfather."" He tells Data that all of his vast Knowledge will not be lost, he has found a way of scanning and digitizing his memories and transferring them to a Computer.This gets Data talking about his ""Off"" switch, and that he does not look forward to having it flipped. Graves says, ""Now where would Soong put such a thing - Don't tell me, let me Guess.""Graves dies before the Enterprise returns, Data says ""He died in My arms"" and insists to Picard that he be allowed to make the Funeral Speech for Graves. Ergo, ""To Know him was to Love him, and to Love him was to Know him. Those who knew him, loved him, those who did not know him, loved him from Afar,"" — making Picard tell Data to shut up once more (Picard never does tell Data to actually ""Shut Up"" until ""Nemesis"").But Data starts acting very strangely, and he takes an unwarranted interest in Kareen. Picard orders Data to be inspected by Crusher, and she diagnoses Data with Dissociative Disorder. At that time, Data/Graves tells Kareen that he had moved his memories into Data, but she reacts and he tries to grab her, injuring the woman he loves. At first, Graves does not want to Vacate Data.But after several more injuries he causes, he moves his memories into the Enterprise Computer Core, and his consciousness leaves Data's Positronic Net.It is a shame this was not pursued in later episodes, they could have recreated Graves in the Holodeck and moved the memories in there, that way, Moriarty would have had a friend to talk to in the years of his inaction.All in All, great acting from both Shepherd and Spiner, and Plakson made a great Vulcan, it is a shame that they never had Selar come back, although the character was part of Crusher's medical staff until the end of the series.",10
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Schizoid Man (TV Episode 1989)",Brent Spiner gets to have some fun with this episode.,"The Enterprise landing party meets Dr. Ira Graves after his assistant sent out a call for help. She thinks he's dying and he refuses to have any help in his final days. It turns out that he is dying--and he knows there is no hope. You'd think he'd have regrets or fears about death, but instead he's STILL a crotchety old guy who has an ego nearly as big as a planet!Of the landing party, Dr. Graves has little interest in the doctor or the other humans. Instead, he's drawn to Data for many reasons. The obvious one is that Graves' work contributed to Dr. Soong's building Data. So, in a way, he's like Data's granddad! As for his other reason for being happy to see Data,...well, you'll just have to see what's next! This is an amusing episode with Data--and not forced like in ""The Outrageous Okona"". This time, the humor worked and the script allowed Brent Spiner (Data) to have some fun and expand his character. Well worth seeing to see the 'new Data'!If you really care, the title, ""The Schizoid Man"", might be misunderstood by some. Despite the root 'schiz', this is NOT a reference to schizophrenia but to a schizoid personality. Such a personality is typified by an individual who has no desire for the company of others. Some, while acting gruff and distant, actually secretly long for friendships and intimacy. A true schizoid personality is perfectly happy being alone and might consider others to be a bother! This is a reasonable description of the main character in this episode, Dr. Graves. Although Graves is a gifted genius, he has no desire to live among people but on his own little planet in the middle of no where. His only companion is a pretty young assistant--a woman with which he has a distant and somewhat cantankerous relationship. She is there to help him in his work...not be his lover or friend. However, although a good argument could be made that Graves has a schizoid personality, the fact that he had deep hidden thoughts about his pretty assistant and secretly wants her would indicate that he's most likely an avoidant personality--a person who PRETENDS to hate people but who, very down deep, wants them or at least one person. It is also possible that the 'schiz' is referring to the literal interpretation--a split mind. However, this is NOT the same as Multiple Personality Disorder and could refer to Data's mind becoming fragmented. Okay...psyc 101 lecture over for today!",9
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Schizoid Man (TV Episode 1989)",Self-aware machines are NOT life forms,"This episode is one of many that explore the essence of a man and his personality vs. an android and his ""persona"".The protagonist, Dr. Graves, is an expert in cybernetics. Living alone on a planet with a young woman associate, he has been exploring methodology aimed at adding a human persona to computer and android mechanisms.The Enterprise is summoned by calls for help by his female aid, Kareen, because Dr. Graves is dying, as subsequently diagnosed. The Enterprise crew arrives to find Graves in pain and displaying bitterness, arrogance and regret over losing his life and the realization of many personal dreams.The doctor makes particular effort to become close to Data, treating him as a grandson and telling him of his life and dreams. It becomes apparent that he has always loved Kareen and regrets the age difference that has prevented the possibility and consummation of a relationship.After passing away, it becomes apparent that the doctor has transferred his persona into Data and has co-opted his body completely, suppressing Data's ""persona"" to an inactive state.As his behavior in the body of Data becomes increasingly emotional, arrogant and erratic, the Enterprise staff figure out what has happened. The co-opted Data pursues Kareen and after being rejected accidentally injures her. This is followed by additional altercations and injuries to crew members, leading up to a plea from Captain Picard that the doctor relinquish control over Data's body thereby, according to the Captain ""depriving another being of his life"".Once again we are confronted with the question of whether only a man can be considered a life form or whether an artificial machine with self-awareness should also be thus categorized and have his ""right to life"" protected.As in previous reviews, I must once again point out the irrationality of such arguments and the degrading attitude they project on the human soul.To my mind, all arguments about self-awareness defining a life form are absurd and reflect utter ignorance of computers and their programming.No matter how much artificial intelligence, ranges of decision parameters, creative options and even random ideas that you program into an artificial mind, you can NEVER create anything like a human persona that has unlimited thoughts and feelings fashioned by his unique soul and identity.The reason is simple: the android's programming - even if self-awareness is included - is never more than the programmed reaction possibilities written by the programmer. And the programmer is a human being who, along with all of mankind, has only limited understanding of himself and the human soul/mind.More so, a program is just that - a preset rule-book of inputs and reactions - even if broad in possibilities, it remains totally preset and limited to an infinite degree, thus precluding any possibility of attributing such an android's decisions, words and actions to a unique persona of its own. The possibilities - however broad ranged - can never breach the bounds and idiosyncrasies of the program. Period.Therefore, the android has no feelings and no independent identity, only reactions executed by the lines of code in the program.The moral implications of comparing such an android to a human being are frightening and no less than a degradation and threat to the dignity and rights of true life forms.Underlying this philosophy is a malevolent ulterior motive to neutralize the imperative of moral behavior, rendering all absolute human values relativistic.""Obviously"" it is claimed, any moral limitations and value judgments can be shown to be parochial and non-binding on others, by pointing out that these artificial ""life-forms"" can be programmed to simulate human life, with no acceptance of any or all human conventions and values. You can build a ""Data"" to do any vile or immoral acts with no compunctions about them, by simply programming him to lack all such values.The goal of such a philosophy as appears in these episodes is precisely aimed at tearing down all societal expectations and moral absolutes, creating a ""wild west"" without human values - since ""life forms"" without such can be created - and where everyone can do exactly as he pleases as long as he has sufficient political backing to sanction his group's morality (or lack thereof) as a ""valid"" system.",8
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Schizoid Man (TV Episode 1989)",Data Gets His Body Hijacked,"In ""The Schizoid Man"" the Enterprise goes to give medical attention to a reclusive, brilliant scientist who lives with only his young, female assistant doing research. Unbeknownst to the crew, Dr. It's Graves figures out how to upload his consciousness into Data before he dies and takes over the android's body. But the irascible doctor's plan to live forever receives hate from the assistant he's in love with. A speech from Picard is able to convince him to give Data his body back. The doctor uploads all of his practical knowledge into the computer's memory banks before dying for good.This episode was a bit on the boring side. There's no real subplot to speak of unless you count the rescue mission we never get to see. The best scene is probably the cold open in which we see Data showing off his new beard to Troi and Geordi. It plays for laughs and it works well. Besides this, this episode is pretty mediocre. Nothing about it is super awful or offensive, but it never really gets going.",5
10,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Schizoid Man (TV Episode 1989)",stuck in the wall..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 02With new smart ideas, compelling dramatic pieces and ethical dilemmas that makes you think twice, the second round of this enterprise crew is surely an improvement where more diversity and maturity is visible.The Schizoid Main""I could use discipline"" pleads and whispers Picard in someone else's ear and the series somehow grows mature, with no big black or white threats, this is diplomacy at its best where it third act is the only disappointment to this brilliant chapter.",
0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Unnatural Selection (TV Episode 1989)",The episode that shouldn't exist,"This episode shouldn't exist as it goes straight against Star Trek canon in every way. First, since the Eugenics Wars, Earth and Federation law strictly bans any genetic experimentation on humans, so the mere existence of Darwin Station is impossible. In a canon episode, if a Starfleet vessel were to find Darwin Station, it would've been immediately shut down, the specimens and the research data destroyed and the personnel arrested.If we discount this giant plot hole, there are still problems with the episode. When the Enterprise finds the USS Lantree and they gain remote control over the vessel, they just activate it's beacon and leave it floating in space. They don't inform Starfleet Command, they don't request a medical or science vessel to investigate, they don't order it to follow the Enterprise, they just leave a potentially really dangerous ship out in open space. Not to mention Picard leaves the Lantree with the keys in the ignition, so to say (it is totally empty but otherwise in perfect working order), so it's a prime target for any shady creatures happening by.The story at Darwin Station is also shaky at best. According to the log, the Lantree left the station 3 days prior to the Enterprise finding it derelict in space. By the time the Enterprise reaches the station, the personnel down on the planet is already showing advanced symptoms, yet in 3 days they didn't put out a quarantine warning or distress signal, they didn't inform Starfleet (or anyone else), nothing. They didn't even try to warn the Enterprise away, they wait for the ship to hail them before they say anything at all, saying they ""just declared a medical emergency"". Really? It's only an emergency after you age 30 years in 3 days? Also, the Enterprise just shows up at the station unannounced, they seem genuinely surprised to see what is happening on the station when they first hail them. What? They didn't try to contact them through subspace? They didn't even try to call ahead, just straight up show up there.Also, the standing quarantine protocols seem to leave much to be desired. There is ongoing debate about what to do next all throughout the episode, as if there is no real quarantine procedure at all. If there is a standing procedure, the captain, the CMO and the station personnel should follow it to the letter. But instead they all argue every step of the way as if it's up to debate. Even if that were the case, Doctor Pulaski trying to argue her point to Picard is utterly needless, since the CMO outranks the captain in medical matters anyway. Also, the sense of urgency regarding the ""child"" specimens is utterly forced and goes against even the simplest disease control rules. Why is it so important to beam them to the Enterprise on the double? Admittedly, they are totally isolated on the station, so they are perfectly safe, there is absolutely no need to move them anywhere until the doctors can figure out what's wrong. It's really reckless and dangerous to move anything out of a quarantine area unless absolutely necessary, which is not the case here. In fact, saying that the ""children"" are not sick doesn't mean anything, since they still could be carriers, which an accomplished disease specialist like Doctor Pulaski should know full well. Going as far as insisting to ""breath the same air and touch them"" is simply beyond stupid.Finally, the ending puzzles me to no end. They decide to blow up the Lantree. This is puzzling for many reasons. First, blowing it up with photon torpedoes is reckless. The remaining flying debris could contain small pockets where the ""disease"" could hide. So unless they outright vaporize the entire ship, it could be even more dangerous to blast it to small pieces that could later contaminate some unsuspecting salvager. Also the Lantree is a fully functional and, I presume, quite ""expensive"" (in Star Trek terms) space ship. Not only that, but it's a Starfleet vessel. Now, that they finally found the nature of the ""disease"", it would be quite easy to set the bio-filters on the Lantree to get rid of the antibodies. If not that, just blast it with a huge dose of ionizing radiation or some other form of decontamination should work nicely. Destroying a perfectly good ship when it can be salvaged is pretty dumb.All in all, this episode was terrible for many reasons and shouldn't even exist.",5
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Unnatural Selection (TV Episode 1989)",Losing a battle with time . . .,"ST:TNG:33 - ""Unnatural Selection"" (Stardate: 42494.8) - this is the 7th episode aired in the second season of The Next Generation. I want to say right off the bat, I really like this episode a lot because it deals with the subject at the very heart of Star Trek - that of the unknown. The episode deals with excelled aging. This episode also shows how stubborn and adamant Dr. Pulaski can be (just like a good ol' Southern Doctor we know very well and as Counselor Troi points out like a familiar captain of the Enterprise-D!). We also get more background on Pulaski - transporter chief O'Brien (who is given more of a role in this episode) she has NEVER used the Enterprise transporter before (just like the aforementioned Southern Doctor). This episode also shows the first real launch from the shuttlebay via the shuttlecraft's perspective. And look out for the great aging makeup effects.",
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Unnatural Selection (TV Episode 1989)",Plot Holes that don't relate with the ST Universe,"Circa 1992 in the Star Trek Timeline there was a war that was based on altering human genetics. This was called the Eugenics War. It was a war between genetically altered humans and natural humans. Natural humans won the war and made genetic tampering illegal at this time as is explained later in Star Trek DS9 when issues of Doctor Julian Bashir's genetic enhancement are brought to light. In that episode Julian's parents arrive on DS9 and his father is forced to serve a 2 year sentence for allowing Julian to be genetically altered as a child and hiding it for so long (something like 22 years). My point is that if genetic alteration is illegal why wasn't the criminality of it brought to light. The Eugenics Wars timeline I am pretty sure was established in the Original Series. My point is that Unnatural Selection is an affront to humanity and peace and the crew doesn't even bat a lash at this concept.One more plot hole I will point out is that Transporter Chief Miles O'Brien is a commisioned officer in TNG - a lieutenant, having obviously gone to the academy, traversed being a cadet, and gotten his officer's commision as an ensign. Later before the show begins he must have been promoted to Lieutenant. The plot hole is that later on in DS9 then Chief O'Brien makes sure to point out on many occasions that he is a non-commisioned officer Chief on many occasions and that would mean that even an ensign such as Nog could tell Chief what to do. How is it possible that a Commisioned officer somehow lost his commision and became an NCO? Could he have resigned his commision, left starfleet, and returned as an NCO? As is proved by Chief Engineer Argyle(He appears in 2 episodes - Ep 5 - ""Where No One Has Gone Before"" is one) in the 1st Season of TNG, and Chief Engineer Lt. Geordi La Forge in the 2nd Season you CAN be a commisioned officer and still be the Engineering Chief.The third and biggest plot hole in this episode is that Dr. Polaski is beamed up in the end and she doesn't carry the ""infection"" which they were so kind to point out earlier in the episode that the ""infection"" couldn't be filtered out through the transporter system and they failed twice to do so, resulting in Dr. Polaski's ""infection"" in the first place. Did something change? Otherwise the whole crew would have been affected by the ""infection"" and it would be the end of the series since everyone you know would be dead. Because they never fully explain how the disease is passed from one host to another you can't really give it full credence as a plot hole, but it was convenient to the story let's put it like that. It seems to me by the conclusion of the episode, considering they saved Darwin IV, they had mastered this condition so why blow up a perfectly good starship when you can transport their crews corpses into space, give her a scrub and tow the derelict back to a starbase or call in a tug as was done once in Season 1 - surely the immune Data could accomplish this if nothing else. Energy and materials are free in the ST Universe but humanoid labor to assemble the materials is not free and they would have to consider it their greatest asset. To give up all that labor in one photon torpedo burst just doesn't seem prudent to what an actual captain might do, in today's navy or in the navy of the future.Lastly, they bring to light the fact that Geordi really doesn't need to wear the visor(banana clip), he just wants to. By DS9 a mere 6 years later they completely rebuild Vedek Bareil in Season 3 Episode 13 ""Life Support"" as he wastes away a piece at a time. When the get to the brain they decide to let him die because he would be nothing but machine at that point. So if they can rebuild an entire human being and prosthetics are in a golden age, then why does Geordi ever start with a visor on this show? It was something that they realized and quickly scrambled to explain later in the series. If I was not correct in this, it would have never been brought up in the show, it would be accepted fact.In conclusion I found this episode to be poorly written, and a poor fit to the Star Trek Universe and in my personal opinion. It's plot holes are so large you could pilot a Galaxy Class Starship thru them. Although Dr. Polaski has more character than Dr. Beverly Crusher, I find her to be more of a liability to the show(bones has been done before and better thanks), and I will be glad when she is finally gone.One more thing, the laptop screens are like 4 inches thick on this episode. You tend to see thru the facade when you see things like that. It's really hard to make a show about the future because everything that happens in the world would have to be reflected in the future as well. For example in the first season I recall Cpt. Picard telling Cmdr. Riker to ""download that file to sick bay"" when he would clearly have to UPLOAD it. Also they don't have bluetooth! When they sit together and talk it's funny because they could've used the internet to look up whatever they wanted and had the computer read it back. Instead they use Data for this function of giving the audience/crew information. It's just kind of funny is all. TNG is a great show, just not so consistent with the lines it predecessors and it's progeny laid out.",5
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Unnatural Selection (TV Episode 1989)",Did I miss something?,"Did I miss something or was the shuttle craft left on the planet since Data seemed to beam back up?

There are more things that I do not understand but it does not detract from the enjoyment of viewing them.",9
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Unnatural Selection (TV Episode 1989)",An interesting idea...too bad that so much of the episode seems overly familiar.,"Much of ""Unnatural Selection"" is quite good. It's sad, then, that the show starts off with a serious deficit because so much of the show seems like a remake of one of the original ""Star Trek"" shows, ""The Deadly Years"".The Enterprise receives a distress signal from a Federation ship. But, by the time they arrive to help, the entire crew is dead-- killed by some disease that turned young and healthy people into old folks who died from 'natural causes' due to age. This certainly isn't good but is worse because it looks identical to the earlier show (and I hate repetition).Fortunately, what follows is still an interesting episode. HOW the virus occurred and how they come up with a solution is all very fascinating. My only other complaint, though, is that the scientists at the Gagarin Station seemed amazingly stupid and unscientific in their thinking...and this didn't make a lot of sense. Flawed but worth seeing.",6
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Unnatural Selection (TV Episode 1989)",The Old Aging Well......Again,"The theme of uncontrollable aging seems to be a favorite of the Star Trek brain trust. In this episode a group of geneticists are playing around with a master-race of children who have aggressive immune systems. The Enterprise quarantines a starship which has on board an entire crew that has died of natural cause due to aging. The ship had been on a planet where the aforementioned engineering was taking place. Now, the same aging process has gone rampant at this facility. These ""children"" will soon be orphans because those who ""parented"" them will only last a few days. Dr. Pulaski risks everything by trying to help one of the young men on board a shuttle and is immediately overcome with horrible arthritic pain. She has the condition. She goes to the planet and helps with the research needed to try to figure out what can be done with these test tube tykes (all of whom look like they are in their mid-twenties). It is up to the crew on board to try to solve the problem. Sometimes the accomplishments of these people range beyond the abilities of future scientists. Data again plays a significant role.

This encounter leads to the Enterprise to a scientific research outpost dealing with genetics and eugenics where the scientists have also started to rapidly age. Here they have created a race of super-children whose immune system is so strong that it has attacked and mutated a harmless virus they were exposed to by the visiting freighter. The super-children's immune system has rewritten the DNA of all of these normal humans.After Doc Pulaski is exposed and begins to age, the crew conceives of a way to reset her DNA using a hair sample and filtering her through the transporter. It works and the Enterprise is able to do it for all the scientists as well. They're experimental children however will have to be quarantined for their entire lives or at least until they're able to change their immune system. The Enterprise destroys the freighter full of the infected dead.This is the most we've gotten of Dr. Pulaski and Transporter Chief O'Brien this far in the series. Both really take center stage at the expense of mostly Worf who doesn't have a lot to do during this one.TOS has a rapid aging episode as well but this ep comes with the twist that it's not the main cast aging, it's a different group. There's a long of technobabble coming from the doctors and O'Brien in this one. I'm a sucker for some made up jargon though so I was all ears.We don't get a real B plot here unless you count them mentioning they need to rendezvous with the Star-Station India. That's probably the biggest flaw of this script since it leaves us dealing with these old geezers and empathic teenagers the entire episode.This episode is pretty middle of the road. Nothing about it really stands out to me but none of its too problematic either. It has a few plot holes and a eugenics station seems super against Federation regulations so I can't rate it much higher than a 6.",6

Picard and company are in a race against time (in more ways than one) to find a ""cure"" for the disease or else lose Pulaski and the other Darwin geneticists to certain death.

A sample of Pulaski's dna will be detrimental to this experiment's success and salvation of other lives not just hers. This episode is what you might call a Diana Muldaur vehicle as she becomes the Chief Medical Officer replacing Dr. Crusher and her stubbornness and traits similar to Bones obviously intentionally pays homage to the iconic McCoy character; she gets center stage as the story is catered to the Pulaski character. Her disputes and debates with Picard (and the revelation that she jumped at the chance to work on the Enterprise because of the opportunity to serve with Picard) are really what make this episode, Unnatural Selection, such a treat.

In other words, show the adventures of the Klingons as they explore space! It cannot consist only of killing everything they meet and could prove fascinating with its various possibilities. Much of my desire to see this was spurred on by ""A Matter of Honor""--an interesting episode that briefly gives you a glimpse of what it would be like aboard such a vessel.When the show begins, you learn that some new crew members from an exchange program are arriving. One looks just like Mordock from ""Coming of Age"" and this character is played by the same actor (John Putch). But, unlike Mordock, this guy is an arrogant know-it-all. In addition, an exchange program with the Klingons has been arranged and Riker volunteers to serve aboard one of their battle cruisers. Sadly, though, he is a series regular and you know this assignment probably will last no longer than the episode.Watching Riker getting along with his new Klingon pals is priceless. What also is interesting is that Riker's new-found bromance with these folks is brought to a huge test when the captain of the vessel believes that they've been attacked by the Enterprise...and he plans on making an attack of his own. What is Riker to do?This is one of the better shows of season two and helps to show that the series was improving as it progressed.

Meanwhile The Enterprise takes on one Exchange Officer: Ensign Mendon the Benzite. We met a Benzite in the Episode where Wesley Crusher competes to get into Starfleet, and a Benzite beat him in. At first Wesley thinks it is the same Benzite, but they are simply part of the same extended family, so they look the same (And can therefore use the Same Actor to play the part).This is the first really good look we have of Klingon ""Nutritional Choices""- And of Gagh, Klingon Serpent Worms. I'll eat Klingon food any day before I touch any Cardassian Food.Christopher Latta is ""Captain Kargon"" of the Klingon Ship The Pagh, and every question he has for Riker is a Trick Question. But Riker knows enough about Worf to give Kargon the right answers: But as this episode progresses, knowing the right verbal answer is not enough, it has to be backed up with Force. Therefore, when Lt. Klag (Brian Thompson) challenges Riker, Riker has to beat the crap out of him. As Kargon explains, it is Riker's first ""Command Decision.""Riker easily wins the respect and obedience of the Klingon Crew, even capturing the attention of two Female Klingon ""CrewMen""-""One? Or Both?"", he tells Klag. Meanwhile, Ensign Mendon (John Putch), who was so eager to please Captain Picard, is having trouble impressing WORF. Especially when he discovers a Metal-Eating Parasite devouring The Pagh's Hull. He initially keeps it to himself, but when sensors pick up the same gunk eating away at The Enterprise Hull, he tells The Bridge crew he had found the same substance on The Pagh.So, after a berating from both Picard and Worf, Mendon figures out a way to clean the parasite off, and the Enterprise chases after The Pagh.But Kargon finds the parasite before the Enterprise can warn him, and he wants to Blame the Enterprise. This puts Riker in a precarious position, he has to serve, fight and possibly die with the Klingon Crew, but on the other hand, he must assassinate Kargon if Kargon becomes inept: Which he DOES.Riker's solution saves not only the Pagh and The Enterprise, which The Pagh would have surely fired on, but he also saves Captain Kargon's Honour.As Riker-with-a-black-eye tells Picard: ""It's (about knowing) when NOT to duck.""",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" A Matter of Honor (TV Episode 1989)",How Could They Keep the Klingons Under Control?,"The Federation has encouraged its starships to participate in an ""exchange"" program. As part of a multi-cultural thing, a group of aliens comes on board the Enterprise. They are eager, and one in particular, a Benzite, like the one who beat Wesley out of a position at the Academy, becomes a bit of a nuisance. A combination of scientific ability and sycophancy make this character intriguing. Like his predecessor, his existence requires him to breath vapors emanating from a tray under his chin. When Picard talks to Number One, asking if he could suggest a crewman to go on board a Klingon ship for the exchange, Riker quickly jumps at the chance. Worf helps prepare him a bit and there is a scene of the Commander eating all manner of Klingon food, including a bowl of worms. It's interesting that not only are these guys the bad boys of the universe, but they eat absolutely nothing conventional (as far as the crew goes). Because they are disgusting, their food must be also. Anyway, Riker must face off against the aggressive, dangerous Klingons to gain status on the ship. Because of his rank in Starfleet, he assumes his same role on board the new ship. There is trouble, of course, because these warlike characters see him as trying to subvert their ship. They will not listen to reason and Riker must act. These Klingon episode always make me wonder how they managed to do rudimentary things on a day to day basis if they spend so much time killing an maiming each other. This ""dying with honor"" thing still involves dying, a seemingly counterproductive activity. The episode does a good job of showing us the ship, and Riker is a worthy match for its crew.",7

When the Pagh finds a small, corrosive hole in it's outer hull, the ship's captain blames the Enterprise. Riker denies culpability but is not trusted yet.The Benzite Mendon discovers similar holes on the Enterprise and Pagh. He discovers what it is and how to fix it. Picard orders the Enterprise to turn around to warm the Pagh. Captain Kargan interprets this is a sign of attack and cloaks up, ready to destroy the Federation vessel if need be.Riker tricks the Klingon captain into getting beamed aboard the Enterprise via an emergency locator he's holding. Riker takes control of the Pagh and communicates with Picard, ordering him to patch the hole. Everything is back to normal. Riker is tossed off the ship by Captain Kargan but Riker understands Klingon a bit more. And the Klingon crew now have more respect for the humans.People say that Season 2 is where TNG really starts to take shape. This is the first episode of the season where I really feel that. We get a nice little plot here involving a multitude of gleep-glocks which is when I think Trek is at its best. We get another appearance from a Benzite and learn a bit more about their culture. (Still don't know what's up with their harmonica holder thing though). And we finally see some cooperation between the Federation and the Klingon Empire, old enemies but new allies.Klingon culture has to walk a bit of a tightrope to be written successfully. If done without a steady hand, the Klingons come across looking a bit foolish and macho. I think the writers do a good job here of showing their honor-bound society without making their ways seem too outlandish. The idea of the first officer having to kill his superior when the leader is unfit is a cool concept. It reminds me of a pack of predators where everyone waits for the Alpha Male to become old and weak before making a power play. Here Riker uses his brain more than his brawn to pull off his successful coup.What's the deal with Wes's fascination with the Benzite people? Everytime one of them comes on the show he tries to get all chummy with them like they're the new kid in class. He only does it with this race though?",8

0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Measure of a Man (TV Episode 1989)",Best episode of the ST:TNG series.,"Of all the episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation, this is the episode that I consider, without hesitation, to be the best episode of the series. Its brilliant writing explores many facets including the right to choose your pathway in life (be you android or not), what makes a ""sentient being"" (""Does Data have a soul?""), the ethics of robotics (do we have the right to make slaves out of them?), friendship, camaraderie, and other factors.As MTDAVIES mentioned, this is the type of storyline that Gene Roddenberry wanted for ""Star Trek"". By the time this episode came along, most of us who watched the series were already attached to the Enterprise crew, and especially to Data as he was the foil for exploring ourselves and the human condition. To have Data be told that he didn't have the right to choose for himself was inconceivable. The resulting JAG case was riveting as well as emotional.You just can't ask for better Star Trek than this. This also ranks very highly in the ""Best Science Fiction ... period"" category.",10
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Measure of a Man (TV Episode 1989)",It could be used in an ethics class!,"Too many people look at the Trek stories and shows as ""just science fiction"" but Gene Rodenberry had much more in mind. This episode stayed true to Rodenberry's vision and made us think and question. It looked at themes of Civil Rights and Slavery.. it looked at ethics, morality and science all intermingling.There was some excellent acting in this one. Whoopi Goldberg, Diana Muldaur, Patrick Stewart & Brent Spiner all played their prospective roles particularly well. But, in my opinion, it was the character of Riker that played the most difficult role in this story and Jonathan Frakes pulled it off excellently! The character of Lt. Commander Data, the android crew member, was an ingenious invention of the Next Generation writers. Each time they explored his character the more interesting he became. This story, by Melinda M. Snodgrass, however, is the best of those explorations of character. It could be used in an ethics class! It is a definite ""must see!""",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Measure of a Man (TV Episode 1989)",Great little piece of television.,"From the setup to the finale, this is a well paced, well acted and well plotted drama. There are moments of humor amid a true detailed exploration of the meaning of humanity, reminiscent of the works of Asimov.Guinan is never used more effectively, and Whoopi's performance is uncannily nuanced, dripping with the precocious wisdom that defines her character. Shows what a strong dramatic actor Whoopi is, and makes me wish the character was used more with this level of effect. The best ethicist on a ship full of them.Falters a little with Riker's reticence and feelings of betrayal, Frakes just can't deliver the internal pressure at the same level as his peers though he does his best and it's not offensive.Ending is predictable but satisfying nonetheless, with an epilogue that caps the affair nicely. On par with the best television has to offer, and certainly the best episode of the season if not the series.",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Measure of a Man (TV Episode 1989)",problem with the premise of this plot line,"This episode does a great job of exploring the nature of humanity and freedom. But there's always been one thing that bothered me about this episode as it relates to the whole Star Trek universe. Commander Maddox makes the statement that Data is a piece of machinery, no different than the ship's computer. However, Data is COMMANDER Data, a commissioned Starfleet officer, who graduated from Starfleet Academy. The ship's computer can make statements and recommendations, which crew members can evaluate, then either accept or reject. As a command officer, if Data gave an order and a crew member chose not to obey it, that crew member risked a court martial. This directly implies that Starfleet recognized Data as a sentient being, and not a ""calculator"" to be experimented upon. In all fairness, I also realize that by using this argument, Gene Roddenberry would have ended up with a very short episode.",9
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Measure of a Man (TV Episode 1989)",Where is the line drawn?,"The usual reaction from the uninitiated when you tell them you like Star Trek is, why? Some people will just never get it, and while I concede that some people are also in danger of getting it a bit too much, classing Star Trek as just sci fi can mean you miss out on some real gems. I have to confess I'm a sci fi fan, conventions attended by uniform wearing devotees is not really my bag but what I do think is that the genre has offered some of the most profound work that has ever been put on film. The original series suffers a great deal from parody and the fact that like any vision of the future it doesn't age well, but it was a real envelope pusher in it's day, a black female regular cast member at a time of palpable racial tension in the United States is a bold move, having her perform the first interracial kiss on network television is not only bold it's historically important. Using science fiction as a metaphor for relevant issues of the day worked very well, and people dig funny aliens and scantily clad green women. Though far from perfect the series never shied away from a hard story line or controversial character and managed to break barriers on the screen and off it. The two decade interval between the cancellation of the original television show and the revival of the franchise with the Next Generation and it's subsequent off shoots meant that the real world was given a bit of time to catch up to Star Trek's ideals if only in spirit than real action. The producers of the new show (which for a time included Star Trek deus Gene Roddenberry until he went on to the greater adventure) did an amazing job with casting. The original crew had long since been elevated to the pantheon of sci fi gods due to syndicated repeats and the successful movie spin offs and they left some pretty big moon boots to fill, but the newbies were up to the job and within a short time they had amassed their own cult following. In fact the antecedent had a far shorter run and after birthing the superfan it soon ran out of steam. It was then drip fed in to pop culture with animation and feature films. By the end of the eighties the well oiled machine that is American television production focused grouped together a superior sequel. The superior part is of course just my opinion. Most of the aliens were still rather obviously guys in rubber suits, and a shaky camera more than often doubled up as a strike from an enemy vessel. In both series the main cast was anchored by the captain, in the original series William Shatner played Kirk as a louche man of action, who would usually get himself in trouble by disregarding orders and not keeping it in his space trousers. The decision was made for the next captain to be less kinetic and more cerebral and Patrick Stewart was able to imbue Picard with an air of Shakespearean authority. While a classic Kirk episode would involve a punch up, a neurotic but deadly cosmic female in not much clothing and a gorn, Stewart's theatre background allowed classic Picard episodes to become more talky affairs. ""Measure of a man"" is an almost perfect vehicle to show this off. At the start the Enterprise and her crew are visiting a nice big space station for some essential maintenance, little aware that some old flames and new slimeballs are waiting to disrupt the interstellar harmony aboard ship. In a moment that has viewers thinking that they should just get it on and get it over with, Picard meets up with Captain Phillipa Louvois, a blast from his pre Enterprise past who is now the senior legal officer in that neck of the galaxy and it is established that much tension, sexual and otherwise still exists. Elsewhere an Admiral getting a tour of the federation's flagship nonchalantly gives a transfer order to Brent Spiner's Commander Data, ordering him to report to the robotics laboratory of Brian Brophy's awfully greasy Commander Maddox. When pushed for a little more detail Maddox reveals to Picard that the transfer will involve the dismantling our favorite android with little or no hope of putting the tin man back together. How outrageous. With any serial the writers are able to present us with different scenarios for our fave characters to be tested with each week while staying true to the core themes. A sci fi show can just as easily take the form of a detective drama, or as in this case a courtroom debate. The problem is having a cast talented enough to pull this off and with Star Trek TNG we are very lucky to have justthat. Brent Spiner will forever be in the hearts of innumerable geeks(myself included) as the pale faced golden eyed metal man who wants nothing more than to be what we take for granted, human. He lives life cut off from emotion but manages to teach lessons to one and all from the morally superior high ground one gains through the inability to feel anything.Patrick Stewart is a stage animal, give the man the words and he will make them seem as sent by god, have him argue that an artificial life form is as sentient as you or I and you might not hit your toaster with the same venom you used to next time it burns your crumpets. Add to this the ever classy Whoopie Goldberg drawing some parallels from history to the debate raging today, and a show about aliens becomes an impeccably presented morality play, asking where does the line between service and slavery fall? And they are doing all this on a wicked cool space ship. Awesome.",9
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Measure of a Man (TV Episode 1989)",There it sits!,"At the start of this, trivia buffs should know, we get to see the first poker game seen. Shortly later an Admiral comes aboard and brings a cybernetics expert on board who wishes to disassemble Data and fit him with an experimental new positronic brain. Data asks a few questions about the procedure and Commander Maddox is a little vague and Data declines and is then handed reassignment orders to Starbase 173 under Maddox's command. Picard tries to block these orders and the whole thing eventually ends up in a court. Is Data person or property? Riker is ordered to prosecute and Picard to defend. This courtroom drama is brilliant character stuff and Frakes puts in one hell of a performance. Stewart puts on almost as good a show and is crushed as Riker begins to prove a better case. Guinan puts Picard on the right track and it is about Maddox eventually creating a entire generation of slaves to be used at mankind's discretion. After winning the case Data goes to Riker and asks him to join the celebration. Riker declines as he almost won his case against him.

This is one of the more intelligent of the TNG episodes dealing with an ethical and moral dilemma - what is the measure of a man, is Data just the property of Starfleet to do with whatever they want just because he's an android (and therefore has no personal freedoms) - would that border on slavery as Whoopi Goldberg (in another appearance as Guinan) points out? Also, Picard meets someone from his past - Judge Advocate General, Phillipa Louvois who was at Picard's Stargazer court martial hearing. Trivia: this is the first time you see the Enterprise crew playing poker together (including Data, Geordi, Riker, Pulaski, and O'Brien) - Data learns the meaning of bluff and what a poker face really means. This is also the first of 3 appearances by Clyde Kusatsu as Admiral Nakamura and a hologram appearance by Tasha Yar. VERY intelligent writing in this episode which makes it one of my favorites.",

Does Data get a say in this? Course not, so Picard drags everyone into the courtroom to hash this out. Is this a legal drama? Yes. Boring? Hell no, and that's part of why 'The Measure of a Man' is the best episode of the show thus far: it's riveting. Jean-Luc lets righteous indignation do the talking, and to see Patrick Stewart all fired up is to watch a gifted actor command the screen.But it also asks the important questions about Data. Sure, he has some sweet superpowers, but is he more than an appliance, there to acquiesce to Starfleet's whims? It's a story about slavery, basic rights and free will.

Words cannot explain the power of this episode. It directly touches on the concepts of dualism, individualism, and identity. The parallels between the scenarios in this episode and in philosopher Bernard Williams' identity thought- experiments are too strong not to mention. If this episode peaked your interest, I strongly recommend that you look into Frank Jackson's argument of knowledge. There is a wonderful YouTube video that illustrates it (search ""Frank Jackson - The Knowledge Experiment - Mary's Room). It's a short video that perfectly explains the validity of Data's concern over losing the substance (definition: Qualia) of his memories despite retaining the knowledge of them. I think it's safe to say that this will not be the last Star Trek episode I watch.",10

This man refers to the Commander as ""it,"" and insists Data is strictly a machine. Since those in a superior position have decided to allow this, a trial ensues, where Riker must take the role on prosecutor and Jean-Luc the defense attorney. Also involved is an old love interest of Picards who finds him a challenge. There are sparks. What happens, eventually, is a moral dilemma as to what constitutes sentience. What is ""the measure of a man""? Data's accomplishments, while impressive, don't seem to stand up very well. However, what of his emotional being? One other thing is brought up. If this man, who is insensitive and full of himself, can break through, he plans on making hundreds, even thousands of Data-like creatures. This may constitute a race that is to be used as the slaves were in our early history. The trial and the issues are extremely interesting and would be food for thought when one evaluates a species.

12,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Measure of a Man (TV Episode 1989)","A true TNG classic, but the Justice part is a bad joke","PLOT (SPOILERS)Commander Maddox dreams of whisking Data away so he can dismantle him, and use the brain-dead model to replicate more AI's. Naturally Starfleet agrees and orders one of their most decorated and valued officers to be torn apart. Picard objects and demands a court case which the newly established starbase cannot provide. Thus the Judge, a former lover/rival of Picard, orders the Captain and First Officer to fulfill the roles of attorney's. Riker refuses to send a friend and fellow officer to his demise so the Judge happily threatens Data's life because of this understandable position. In the courtroom showdown, Riker argues that Data is a mere machine and property of Starfleet whereas Picard argues he is a living, sentient being with rights. Picard is losing but after a talk with Guinan he realizes that using Data that way would mean slavery, and in a brilliant speech, Picard wins over the Judge and other participants and Data is allowed to choose - naturally he refuses but does express interest in the idea, encouraging Commander MaddoxTHINGS I LIKEDThis is a fantastic episode. Frakes, Spiner, Goldberg and Stewart give stellar performances and the way Data is basically silent whilst others determine his fate is done in a powerful way. You cannot help but feel for the android who so desperately wants to be human and is now almost destroyed by humans. Maddox and Louvois (the Judge) are believable characters. Picard's ending speech is monumental and I am not at all surprised this episode is sometimes used by college courses in robotics and AI. Riker turning off Data is a real ""now just wait a sec!"" moment. The legendary poker night begins. The judge is very emotional as she weighs Data's soul or lack of it, and I truly believed her when she gave him the right to determine his own life. The use of Yar's image was very neat and I liked Maddox calling Data ""it"" until the last moment when he calls him ""he"".THINGS I DISLIKED1) This is more a consideration than an annoyance but every scene with Guinan (whether it's with Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Worf's parents, Wesley, Ro or LaForge) essentially makes Troi obsolete. She is a better counselor, offering wisdom rather than a lecture, and does so without violating people's privacy of thoughts and feelings (for instance, Worf in the transporter room in Loud as a Whisper, or Dr Stubbs in Evolution). It also helps that she, unlike Troi, doesn't patrol the corridors looking for patients to harass or publicly humiliate.2) The real problem I have with this episode is of course the justice bit. The starbase isn't staffed yet so the logical thing would be to use that magnificent Warp 9.9 engine and go to one that is. But no, utterly unqualified officers are assigned to fill these positions. Both of whom are Data's close friends. The Judge is a memory of the past for Picard and she basically says she loves him. Judge Louvois basically orders Data to his grave just because Riker doesn't want to help send him there. Riker is allowed to physically attack Data but not to give a closing statement. He doesn't object once to Picard's attack on Maddox. Picard actually invites the Judge to DINNER for crying out loud, moments after she rules in favor of her favorite. And worse of all, no one in Starfleet objected to Data, one of their own, and clearly a living, sentient being, with many titles, achievements and medals, and many years of loyal service, being dismembered by this lunatic mad scientist. Even after being vindicated, f I were Data, I would give them all the finger and resign anyway. It shows that despite the self-important glee that Starfleet, above all others, respects new life and beings' rights, they do not care one bit for their own and would happily sacrifice a valued bridge officer so they can have disposable slaves. Highly, highly questionable. While I like Commander Maddox realizing not just the error of his ways but also Data's value, it bothers me that no one in Starfleet admits to any wrong, and barely a Season later, in ""The Offspring"", we see that Starfleet has learned and respects nothing as they send yet another admiral to steal a intelligent and sentient being, just because it is a very different and unique one.CONCLUSIONThis is a TNG classic, a Star Trek and TV classic, and is one of the best looks into artificial lifeforms and their rights I have ever seen. Acting is top notch in this one. In a rather shaky season 2 this one stands out by a country mile. However, it does not get a perfect score because the utter fallacy of Starfleet Justice is shown. I'm genuinely surprised no other reviewer has mentioned this. The offhand way Admiral Nakamura (I think?) just says ""Oh this Commander Maddox and he will destroy that yellow robot over there"" is ridiculous. He is already a recognized living being (Pulaski says that Starfleet records state this) and who the hell says that when the clearly sentient officer in question is within earshot. This episode, even more than the Drumhead, has that feeling of being a very good episode while showing the complete fallacy of Starfleet Justice. Fair trial, my backside. 8/10 for Picard's speech, the acting, and the bold topic. Two point deduction for the insensitive and let's-betray-everything-we-stand- for attitude from, you guessed it, an Admiral and Starfleet in general.",8

There are a number of reasons for this. For one, I prefer the Kirk/Spock/McCoy trifecta to the more ensemble approach of TNG (though I respect the latter and the actors who bring it to life). I also tend to think of TNG as a bit too... I dunno, self righteous? Goody goody? Woke? For my tastes, anyway. I like the (relative) rougher edges of the original series. But I've wanted to go back and explore a little TNG, so I figured, why not start w/one of its best regarded episodes. Good call, that.""The Measure of a Man"" is fantastic television. On paper a Picard vs. (a reluctant) Riker courtroom drama over Data's rights sounds a little dull, but as written it's smart and compelling stuff. This is an episode that nourishes the mind and the soul, earning its happy ending w/o cheats and never once becoming cloying. The performances are also quite good. Patrick Stewart has rightfully won many accolades over the years, but his cast mates don't typically find themselves listed among the great thespians of their age. That said, they're all very good in their roles, and Jonathan Frakes was never better than he is here.I don't know that one episode is enough to make me a Next Gen convert, but I'm very pleased to say that watching an episode regarded as one of its best by those who love it, I'm inclined to agree.",8

We previously learned in ""Datalore"" that Data had been found on Omicron Theta by Starfleet officers and so if he's only property, Starfleet would be guilty of the theft of Dr. Sung's property.Still, this is the best episode of season 2. It's what Star Trek is supposed to be about, an exploration of what constitutes a person, even if it does ignore some legal questions.

As the second highest aboard, Riker is forced to prosecute against his desire. If he doesn't (or does his job badly), JAG Captain Phillipa Louvois will call the trial off and let Maddox do what he wishes to Data.The trial starts off badly for Data with Riker bringing up valid points and turning Data off at one point. But a recess does Picard a world of good. He heads to Ten Forward where Guinan gives him some sagely advice on what this precedent what mean for Data as the first of his race: basically slaveryUsing this argument and proving Data's sentience, Riker tears down Maddox's arguments and claims. Louvois doesn't feel comfortable dooming an entire race of androids to subservience and let's Data walk and free man and rejoin the Enterprise.This is the first truly great episode of TNG. I typically dislike courtroom episodes of any of the Star Trek series but this one is by far the best of the bunch. It's got a great moral dilemma, superb acting from Stewart and Spiner, and a topical analogy that will be questioned for decades to come.I don't really have much to criticize about this episode. I guess I don't really understand the regulations: why does Riker have to be the prosecution here? Why can't they make Maddox or Admiral Nakamura do it? If Nakamura is the highest ranking officer here, can't he do it? Also Maddox is the same rank as Riker. Can't they substitute him in? He's got more of a horse in this race anyways.But I'm nitpicking.

What got me was Data saying he was intimate with Yar and it actually meant something to him. Can't get more human than that. As many times as Data has saved the Enterprise by being the only one who could withstand certain elements, I can't believe that Starfleet would be willing to risk losing him by an uncertain scientist who is clearly under a lot of pressure to make a name for himself.

17,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Measure of a Man (TV Episode 1989)",always an option..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 02With new smart ideas, compelling dramatic pieces and ethical dilemmas that makes you think twice, the second round of this enterprise crew is surely an improvement where more diversity and maturity is visible.The Measure Of A ManThe courtroom drama is more sentimental than uproaring as one would anticipate, either way the result is not tear jerking but a genuinely moving adventure for Picard especially since this time this unknown land is the staged courtroom.",

Captain Picard has received to have Data report to Brian Brophy a cybernetics
professor with Star Fleet. Data is to report to be disassembled to find out just
what Dr. Sung did that makes Data the unique creation he is. The theory is
that if we can build a race of Datas, the Federation would be invincible.From Patrick Stewart on down the Enterprise crew regards Data as one of
them and don't like him being dissected like a lab rat. Brophy throws the whole matter into the Federation's futuristic JAG office in the person of Amanda McBroom.Every player out there loves courtroom scenes and that is no less true in the
Star Trek franchise. Patrick Stewart is Data's Counsel and Jonathan Frakes is
dragooned into prosecution.Ironic as all get out in that Data's never ending quest for humanity he should
be put through a procedure like this to prove him worthy of being treated like
a living being. Not Clarence Darrow, not F. Lee Bailey could have done a better
job of defending him than Captain Picard.Of course a little advice from Guinan helps which occurs in a key scene with

I understand she was about 25 years old in this episode, but sells the Alien Teenage Princess thing beautifully.So of course Wesley develops his first crush. Unfortunately, the girl has a nanny ""Anya"" acting as a Deflector Shield (Voice Actress Paddi Edwards - Who ironically was the voice of 'Gozer' in Ghostbusters).In fact, Paddi the nanny was the high point of this Ep. We all thought she was just a protective old woman until she changes into a monster in sick bay. An ""Alasamorph"" - maybe a distant cousin to Odo, a Shapeshifter, and she's good at it. But her over-protectiveness is interrupting normal ship operations, and Salia (Jaime) is affecting Wesley the same way, he can't get any work done.Picard confines Anya to quarters. She has a great confrontation with Worf. This gives Salia a chance to sneak out and chase down Wesley.But ""Nothing is as it seems"", in more ways than the obvious. It is not simply that the nanny 'Anya' is not who she seemed, but we see Salia talking to a young woman and then a short alien bear. Eventually we figure out that these are also Anya, and she is much more than a Nanny.Basically this episode is Anya and Selia's taxi ride from Harlem to The Bronx, and what they did to spend the time. The Enterprise is simply a backdrop, and it was lucky for Salia as well that Wesley was there to get all bothered.This episode was long before they had any digital shots, so there are a couple of transformation sequences done by Dan Currie which were matte paintings shot over each other in rapid succession. The end result was fantastic. Eventually, Foundation Imaging would do CGI for Odo's transformations in DS9, but here, they could do more than the regular Orangish Odo-Goo, you could see the hair and skin textures developing in each piece of the transformation.This episode in fact had a lot of great imagery, and it was all practical effects. It's worth seeing, even if you don't like Wesleysodes like this. But the Wesley-Salia salivation is not the only connection, there is a strong Anya-Worf connection, and the interaction between Michael Dorn and Paddi Edwards is like watching two boxers in the ring.

I was actually impressed by the youngest actors' performances in this one, and the script is fairly solid. I think that its rating might also be suffering because it follows one of the best Next Generation episodes of all time (""The Measure of a Man""). But it's well worth seeing.

4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Dauphin (TV Episode 1989)",The Dauphin,"It is kind of unfortunate for the Beverly Crusher character that she wasn't on board the Enterprise when her son met his first love and had his first kiss.

Salia was born from parents who were from opposite sides, so after their deaths, she was taken from her homeworld and sheltered light years away, Anya raising her for this specific purpose. Salia has reservations (who wouldn't?) and reluctance about the whole idea of becoming some leader of an entire planet, supposedly the last chance for a peace, the beacon of hope for centuries of war. Wesley becomes a monkey wrench in these plans, stirring the anger of Anya who serves as a Mama Bear Protector (and can shift into a giant furry creature with bulging red eyes, bear claws, and fangs), as Salia begins to contemplate the idea of exploring galaxies, enjoying the sights and sounds of other worldsintroduced to her by Wesley on the Holodeck and throughout the ship. So Picard is in a pickle and he has asked Wesley to stay away from Salia (as Anya has insisted Salia stay away from Wesley). That will not be easy. Good moments between Wesley and Guinan (especially the end) talking about first love and how empty it can feel once that person that built such a strong bond with him is now gone. This episode also makes a statement (when Salia reveals what she *really* looks like) about love not being about what you look like as much as who you are, although Wes is rather taken aback by Salia's secret regarding the ability to take forms of any lifeform she so chooses. Worf's scenes with Anya, over which is a superior fighter and protector, make for some nicely intense back-and-forth, but their truce is perhaps even more special when both acknowledge their similarities.

And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws.

Indeed, this episode has everything a good Star Trek episode should: drama, suspense, mystery, intrigue. The interesting question as to whether the problems of the advanced star ships are design flaws raise interesting questions concerning the flaws of technology. The whole story about this ancient, lost race is really interesting and well developed. The technological difficulties are equally well done. The repeated encounters with the Romulans are especially good, showing a battle unlike any we have seen before. The dialogue in this episode is some of the sharpest I've seen in Star Trek. In fact, the script to this episode is probably one of the best of TNG. That is, until they went about writing the ending. Okay, I love Star Trek but the ending to this episode certainly must go down as one of the worst and most disappointing. The first 40 minutes really grab you, make you want to know and understand what is going on. But, well, let me put it this way. The 'solution' to the problem is something a 15 year old could have come up with. Any person with half a brain would have tried it first, not almost let the ship be destroyed before it occurred to them. And it didn't even occur to Geordi, he just witnessed Data's system doing it. Seriously, if Geordi is that incompetent he has no place being in the engine room. But of course, as we know, he's not. This is just a badly developed ending that deflates the episode.

6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Contagion (TV Episode 1989)",Contagion,"""Fate. Protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise.""Interesting how one of the best episodes (for my money, maybe not yours) comes from one of the lesser seasons of the series. ""Contagion"" has always been one of my all time favorite episodes, and has remained on my mind since I first watched it as a young teenager in the early 90s. A ""system failure"" possibly caused by a probe from an ancient alien race called the Iconians (studied by all at Starfleet Academy as a possible civilization, considered as a myth by most) destroys a galaxy class starship, The Yamato, in the dreaded Neutral Zone (a Romulan cruiser has been following the Yamato for their own desire to seek out the technological advancements of the ancient Iconian race) and the USS Enterprise must uncover details that will rescue them from a similar fate. Downloaded records from the Yamato have ""infected"" the system of the USS Enterprise and Picard's options at finding a way of correcting this before the ship is destroyed by system failures is deteriorating. The planet where the Iconian civilization is located (in essence, Iconia), is found to have been ""bombarded by orbital debris"", and could be the answer to the method of rescue for the Enterprise so Picard will have Data and Worf accompany him (against Riker's judgment that the Captain lead the team) to the surface hoping to get information sorely needed if another catastrophe is to be avoided. All that seems to remain is a control center which features programs including one that opens a gateway to travel to planets and ships (including, appropriately enough, the Enterprise and Romulan vessels). When Data is ""probed"" (a joke I couldn't pass up), and infected with the same ""system rewrite"" that destroyed the Yamato and is disabling the Enterprise, it could, surprising enough, give Geordi the method for ""cleansing"" the ship of the program created by the Iconian people. What an awesome episode this is, just a ton of fun and further illustrates how well Picard and crew can solve complex problems through the misfortune that comes from boldly exploring an unknown universe. The Romulan conflict and how it ties in with the Neutral Zone treaty is also a major part of this episode. Seeing the Enterprise lose its capabilities, shields and weapons systems fluctuating in on and off patterns, the ""hiccups"" of malfunctions becoming hazardous and aggravating to the crew (the turbolift and Warp Engine controls both harm poor Geordi who sure serves as a punching bag in this episode), this episode comments on the dependency on technology and how this can be detrimental to those on board ships in space. The opening destruction of the Yamato just left chills all over once again as if I was watching ""Contagion"" for the first time. The scene where Picard is accessing the personal logs of his old pal, the Captain of the Yamato, it is, to me, just as eerie and chilling as the ship's demise, because this is kind of the final voice of a now-dead crew who can no longer speak. Funny moments are here as Dr. Pulaski tells one of her staff how to splint an injured leg and the replicating machine doesn't give Picard his tea as asked for, instead producing a plant!",9
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Contagion (TV Episode 1989)",The Crew Learns How to Do a System Reboot,"In ""Contagion"" the Enterprise rushes to the aid of its sister ship in the Neutral Zone, the Yamamoto, only to watch helplessly as it malfunctions and explodes, killing everyone aboard. The Enterprise learns that the Yamamoto had crossed the border because it thought it had discovered the location of an ancient, high-tech race known as the Iconians whose ruins may help the Federation leap forward in their current technologies.But the crew realizes too late that the Yamamoto was destroyed by an Iconian probe that started to rewrite the software aboard and made its systems go haywire. But downloading the destroyed ship's logs, the Enterprise has opened itself up to the same fate. To make matters worse, the ship is being stalked by a Romulan vessel who is also encountering technical problems.An away team consisting of Picard, Data, and Worf beams down to the planet where they believe the Iconian ruins are and find some systems still up and running. Before Data can troubleshoot the answer, he's zapped by a probe and his programming starts to get recoded. Worf takes his back to the ship to see of he can get Geordi to fix him. Data seems dead but reboots after a few seconds, basically as a backup before all this code got injected into him. Geordi realizes they can do the same thing with the ship's system to fix everything. Picard destroys the remaining tech on the planet as it's too advanced for the Federation or the Romulans to safely use it. They beam Picard aboard and head back for Federation ship, telling the Romulans how to save themselves on their way out.My biggest take away from this episode is how incompetent Geordi can be sometimes. He didn't think to reboot the system with a backup? That seems like one of the first things they should have tried when the ship got funky, if not the very first thing. Him or Data should have come up with that idea but it never crossed either of their minds.So the ending is a bit of a disappointment. I would have liked to have seen a more complicated or clever solution. I would have liked Data to explain that the Iconian probe had infected all the backlogs as well, making a reboot impossible but apparently it was a valid option the whole time. It's a dumb finale.I do like the Romulans inclusion, we haven't got any good time with them in a while. It was even cool to see Picard on their bridge, even if it didn't amount to much. Pulaski is really shoehorned into this ep for no apparent reason.This was very close to a good episode but the last 10 minutes or so really drag it down for me. A more elegant solution really could have made this one of the highlights of Season 2.",5

Now, when I was younger, I don't think I got a lot of the humor, but now when I watch it I laugh my head off. The plot is fairly clever and it's always hilarious when we see the members of the Enterprise try to interact with obsolete technology. The plot revolves around Riker, Worf, and Data become trapped in a sort of simulation based off a ""second rate"" novel that is set in a 1920's gangster era hotel/casino. The characters they interact with are caricatures and I think the actors and actresses playing them have a good time with that. It's obvious that the writers had a fun time making the most cliché'd version of the hotel that they possibly could. For example, there's a rich Texan playing blackjack and loudly giving advice to anyone who will listen, because there's ALWAYS a rich Texan acting just like that in these kind of novels.

Sure Star Trek is so good because it so often brings up real problems which we actually can learn from, but once in a while I enjoy the fact they they can make episodes that are just pure Sci-Fi fun. And episodes like these are quite clever. Episodes like this is a sort of supernatural problem explained trough science fiction. The away-team; Riker, Worf and Data find themselves in a hotel. It is a lonely structure on a literally dead planet, the inhabitants don't register as life-forms, but still exist. And only to make it more exiting they are incapable of exiting the hotel. (SPOILER AHED) It turns out the whole place is an recreation of a second rate novel owned by a dead 21 century astronaut they find in the hotel. Turns out the life form on the planet assumed this was the natural habitat for humans and created it for him. (SPOILER ENDS) To be honest this episode just makes me laugh, and it shows Data and Riker on their best and funniest. heck even Worfs grumpy attitude are funny at times. But the episode still manages retain it's seriousness.This reminds me of some of the classical TOS episodes like; the Squire of Gothos, Patterns of Force, and mostly Spectre of the gun. Like mentioned before there are three types of episodes, well there are also three settings for Star Trek; the enterprise, alien planets, and the ""bizzarre"" setting. I like these because they always present a mystery and plays on the unknown.

S Richey whose cheap dimestore novel, Hotel Royale, was the inspiration for a recreated place by an alien race who accidentally killed his shuttle crew, out of perhaps guilt hoping the sole survivor might have the comforts of what they believed home was to him. A French mathematician's theorem is mentioned by Picard as he studies it, like so many, trying to find the answer and it has a reason for being a topic of conversation as it pertains to the mystery behind how Richey's shuttle, whose trajectory was disrupted when in space exploring the end of the Earth's solar system, could have made it out so far. The main ""suspense"" angle of the premise is that away team Riker, Data, and Worf beam onto a planet with a nasty atmosphere incapable of human life, but a single structure exists that has breathable air. This is the Royale, and the trio get trapped in the alien-created hotel, needing to uncover a way to get out so they can beam back to the Enterprise. The answer could be in the recreated details of the novel and their role as it pertains to the results of the conclusion of Hotel Royale. This is one of those undemanding episodes that tickles the funnybone...but ""The Royale"" isn't a barnburner or of certain importance in regards to the Trek Universe or the characters that inhabit it. That said, Noble Willingham (Walker, Texas Ranger) as a Texas gambler with a cowboy hat, with lingo and drawl to match, and bubble-headed Jill Jacobson as a gullible lady he easily manipulates are fun characters within the Royale literary creation on the planet; Data's interaction with them adds charm to the episode.

As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 02With new smart ideas, compelling dramatic pieces and ethical dilemmas that makes you think twice, the second round of this enterprise crew is surely an improvement where more diversity and maturity is visible.The RoyaleIt is exactly like finishing the unfinished novel, a bit obliged to connect the dots and surf through the antics, where the blanks are filled in with humor, but then who is to complain if you having just pure fun.",

2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Time Squared (TV Episode 1989)",Time Squared,"""There is the theory of the Mobius—a twist in the fabric of space where time becomes a loop from which there is no escape."" I have always found that some of my favorite Trek episodes deal with time paradoxes and parallel universes where the characters of the show often meet themselves in the future or we are introduced to an alternate version of themselves. Imagine the horror of encountering the future version of yourself, returning on a shuttle craft, with footage recorded of the Enterprise's destruction, six hours the time for which you can prepare. Another Picard from six hours into the future, a warning to the present Picard that unless an alternate plan can be executed, diverting disaster, The Starship Enterprise will be destroyed. While no signs ahead show any danger, a ""time vortex"" appears, the Enterprise being sucked into it. Picard has anxiety and anger in equal measure, needing the future Picard to tell him the steps he took prior to the ship's destruction. The vortex seems to be a lifeform that is interested in Picard himself, but why? The ""future"" Picard might have the answer. I imagine ""Time Squared"" is one of those episodes that drive certain scientists crazy. I haven't the intellect to analyze and dissect the approach by those involved in the writing of this episode regarding whether or not the results are realistic/logical—could Picard and company actually avoid the Mobius for which Worf theorizes the Enterprise might be facing? I just understand that the show would have to go on and accept that we have the ability to alter fateperhaps we have the opportunity to change course and direct a different path into the future, in essence, redirect a predetermined fate. This episode is food for thought and does a good job of conveying Picard's torment—no one would want to be in his position; this speaks volumes about what it takes to be a Starship Enterprise Captain. Picard's reliance on the opinions of his crew, like Riker and Troi, really says a lot about the Captain's interest in what they think and believe. What I love about The Next Gen is the wisdom of the crew and their willingness to look at a problem, seek a solution from various angles, and theorize a proper solution; sometimes, it might be LaForge, or Pulaski, who has the right solution, and Picard, to his credit, is a willing listener. Picard doubts himself and Pulaski speaks to Troi about possibly removing the Captain from his duty if he can no longer command properly; this episode is quite a roller-coaster, a mind-bender with a far-out premise that really pushes Picard to the brink. Because Picard is a thinker, someone who is not quick to rush to judgment without intellectualizing the possible consequences of rash action, episodes like ""Time Squared"" show why he was such a superior Captain. Picard's decision to ""kill himself"" was not only surreal to me but rather profound...to look at yourself and be willing to use a phaser to alter the future by possibly killing you, there's this bit of loss I think Patrick Stewart illustrates when the ""real Picard"" must take drastic action to halt the destructive time anomaly from destroying his ship. That final scene as Picard looks forlornly out of a window, gazing at the stars with Riker stopping by to console him is actually rather heartbreaking to me...Picard is actually emotionally wounded, I believe.",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Time Squared (TV Episode 1989)",The Slingshot effect,"This was one of the better Star Trek: The next generation episode. It deals with Captain Picard who is mysteriously found on a shuttle craft out in deep space. The problem is that this discovery is a duplicate of the Captain who is already on board the Enterprise. After the shuttle craft logs are broadcast, it appears that the Enterprise was destroyed six hours into the future with the sole survivor being the Captain. Since a captain always ""goes down the ship"", the ""real"" Picard cannot understand why the future Picard would do such a thing. What comes out of this is feelings of self-doubt and uncertainty as to what to do in the next several hours. As the time approaches with the current Picard coming to the same time reference as the future Picard, the future Picard starts to ""phase back"" and become more coherent. The current Picard realizes that the future Picard had made a deadly choice that resulted in the Enterprise destruction. The ship becomes enveloped in a time vortex that tries to drag it inside the vortex. Picard makes a last minute decision to stop the future Picard from repeating his previous actions and instead propels the ship using a slingshot effect. This changes the dynamics of the subsequent future time line. Picard essentially had a second chance to correct his ""error"".",8

8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Time Squared (TV Episode 1989)",Not great,"While the basic premise is interesting enough, this episode just has too many flaws. Some of them are evidence of just sloppy writing; with a little more care, the story could have been much tighter.1) At the opening, Picard announces that they're picked up an ""automated signal"" from a shuttlecraft. But just a minute later, Worf announces that communication with the shuttle is not possible because the shuttle is without power. Well, call me dumb, but it seems to me that sending out an automated signal suggests that communication IS possible and the shuttle is WITH power.2) Polaski tries to revive Picard II and the result is that it virtually *kills* him. But then a short time later, Picard orders her to try again, and she does, and this time it works just fine. Huh?3) The whole idea seems to be that Picard II is completely out of phase with this time, which is why his readings are all strange, why he reacts backwards to the stimulant, why he can't grasp the reality around him. But if he's so out of phase, how is it that Troy has no problem reading him at the very outset, so clearly as to be *certain* that he's really Picard? This in particular seems like a lazy means to establish plot to the audience, rather than something that makes sense within the framework of the story.4) After an approximately one minute run of full warp power (roughly timed by my tivo), we are informed that the engines can't handle the strain and Geordi can't hold it, and they have to execute a full stop. However, at 0:46 into the episode, Geordi announces that they are again at maximum warp; at 0:47 he says ""Captain, I can't hold it any longer, if we don't shut down *right now*, we are going--"" and Picard cuts him off and tells him to hold position. And he does. All the way until 0:57. Now, to be fair, that included a 4-minute commercial break. But, at least *some* of that time counts, because Picard leaves the bridge as we go to commercial and arrives at sick bay as we return. So it's still roughly *10 minutes* that Geordi has no problem holding the full warp power after he protested that he couldn't. By that point, the engines should be a shambles, but he has no problem providing ""all the power you can muster!"" Now remember, it is well-established that Geordi doesn't exaggerate in his reports to the captain (in ""Relics"", he tells Mr. Scott this explicitly). So when he says he can't hold it any longer, we have every reason to believe him. Yet it's a completely lie, he holds it another 10 minutes, no problem, and still has power to spare. Again, sloppy writing.5) Perhaps the most egregious: the whole vortex-being thing makes *no sense*. Where did it come from? Where did it go? What did it want? Why did it want Picard? Troy says the being is not thought but instinct, yet wanting one particular individual sure sounds like a thought, not an instinct. The whole point of the vortex was it was trying to pull the ship in, yet when the ship voluntarily flies in, absolutely nothing happens.This flaw is so bad that the script even acknowledges it, having Picard muse at the end about how the whole thing doesn't make any sense. But having the characters acknowledge this flaw doesn't make it any less of a flaw.At the end of my recent viewing of the episode, I was thinking to myself that the whole thing might have made sense if it was some kind of test by Q. Well, it turns out I was right! Apparently, this episode was originally intended to be a two-parter featuring Q. It's a pity they didn't follow through with that idea.",4

A ""civilian adviser"", for whom Will knows personally, will brief him on the Aries missionKyle Riker (Mitchell Ryan), his father! We see immediately that Will has animosity/hostility for pops and ""The Icarus Factor"" examines what that is. Most of it deals with the death of Will's mother/Kyle's wife and how the two often compete with each other. The martial arts fighting style of ""anbo-jytsu"" might be the right sort of action to get these two to ""bury the hatchet"" or, at the very least, confront the personal issues that currently estrange them. Also fascinating is the fact that Kyle and Dr. Pulaski were once romantic and Worf is going through an emotional turmoil where he's not only isolating himself from the rest of the crew but snaps at any officer who dares to confront him out of curiosity/worry. It turns out, thanks to Wesley Crusher's research (he's the one who is motivated to pursue what is wrong with Worf after he yelled at him for no reason other than annoyance), that Worf has reached the tenth anniversary of the ""Age of Ascension"", a spiritual pain ceremony where a Klingon must endure the ""rite of passage for a warrior"" by taking shocks to the upper torso with painstiks as his family looks on from afar. This episode really gives the Riker character a chance to determine his current career path, whether he is ready for his own command or would rather remain on the premier Federation starship as a first officer to the Captain, and also finally acknowledge his pain in regards to his authoritative, well-respected, and highly popular father, a towering figure who has quite the commanding presence. You can see that Will has been battling for years to escape the shadow of his father, and his efforts have been rewarded with the new command offered him. Look, we know Will wasn't about to leave the show so the end result—the decision—isn't some big surprise, but seeing him come to terms with a father he has felt a particular disregard/anger for is really what the episode is truly about. Ultimately, this episode is about family, especially fathers (Wesley never got to know his father, Worf who never knew his Klingon father, and Riker who has never forgiven his father for past ""misdeeds""). A minor subplot involves the USS Montgomery sending scientists to the Enterprise to study a ""glitch"" in Engineering, with Chief Engineer Geordi a bit disenchanted with the idea that he cannot fix his own problemsa bit of irony comes into play as Data pronounces what he believes is the reason behind the anomaly before the officers board and is correct.

This is what I consider a Riker episode, delving into his past by a surprise visit from his estranged father (played by Mitchell Ryan of ""Dharma & Greg"" fame) before Will Riker takes a captain position of the Starship Aries he is offered that will take him on a far away mission. The estrangement is caused by the death of Will's mother when he was still a young child. Also his father knows Dr. Pulaski, who is an old love of hers. You also get to see Riker looking at photos of his childhood in Alaska, including one with him holding a fish.At the same time, Worf is increasingly hostile to the rest of the crew - it turns out he is feeling isolated because it is the anniversary of his Age of Ascension, an important Klingong ritual - and it's up to Wesley, Data and Geordi to help Worf!Trivia: there's also mention of PCS - Pulaski's Chicken Soup!",

His leadership and his overall competence has brought an offer of command on another ship. There are two issues. One is the fact that the ship he would go to wouldn't have the spirit of adventure this one does. I assume he may be bored. The other factor is that Will's father is on board and there is no love loss on Riker's part. He is resentful and full of almost childhood hatred. Somehow, the father is seen as indifferent to his son and not adequately affected by the death of his wife, Will's mother. This is a tired old plot where the guy can't speak to his son for more than a few seconds without the son taking off. Riker's father is a handsome, impressive man, highly respected in Starfleet. He apparently also has had some romantic connection to Dr. Pulaski. Of course, we know what's coming. The second plot is that Worf has been acting distant and silent. It turns out that he is in the tenth year of his age of ascension, and he needs to transition into a warrior. This is done by his surviving a painful ritual where he is subjected to incredible pain by a gauntlet of Klingon warriors with pain sticks. This is supposed to be set up by a family, but since Worf has no family, he must rely on his friends, Geordi, Will, and Data. Of course, Worf would never ask for this since it is a question of honor.It's an OK episode but not really memorable.",7

This would take him to a far-off unexplored section of the galaxy. Delivering a report on his mission (if he chooses to accept it) is Riker's absentee father Kyle who always chose his career over raising Commander Riker. The son wants nothing to do with old Pa and has a lot of other things to think about with this potential promotion.Meanwhile Geordi, Data, and Wes try to figure out what's eating Worf who seems more taciturn than usual. Wes figures out it's the 10 year anniversary of his Klingon Ascension, typically a celebratory event surrounded by family and involving a violent ritual. The trio program this into the holodeck and watch as as Worf walks through a battery of Klingon painstiks. Worf is grateful to everyone for setting this ritual up for him.Back in the main plot, Riker continues to deal with his daddy issues. We learn that Kyler Riker and Pulaski had a previously undisclosed romantic relationship, much to Commander Riker's chagrin. Father and son argue until finally deciding to settle things with anbo-jyutsu, the supposed pinnacle of martial arts. Riker has never beaten his father but learns during the match that Pops has been cheating all these years to win. The two have a heart-to-heart and make up. Riker decides he wants to stay on the Enterprise as Number One.This episode is real cheesy but I can't help but like it a little bit. I watched this as a kid and remember Worf's wild BDSM Bar Mitzvah as a terrifying moment. This B plot is probably the best part of the ep.I could do without the Riker vs. Riker arguments. I don't think this really adds too much to Commander Riker's character, as he's pretty flushed out already. If anything it does more to develop an underwritten Pulaski character. I also thought Troi did really well in this episode and took no guff from Riker's sexist father.The final scene of the two laying it down on the mat is hilarious but I gotta say... it kind of works. This whole episode is goofy but it has a lot of things to like.",6

Most see this episode as one about Riker getting at odds with his father. In fact, i believe is more about the two of them finally dealing with the loss of Will's mother (Kyle's wife).
The unraveling story gives us some funny moments, specially when Troi and Doctor Pulaski (another of Kyle's former partners), step in to try and help the two men work out their issues.
Then, there's the Anbo-jytsu, one of those failed attempts from Star Trek to come up with ""futuristic"" aspects of human culture. It's like a cheap American Gladiators with cross-bike like armor, even less believable.
Overall, an entertaining show, that builds on Riker's backstory and motivations.

I have a lot to say about that, but not here.This episode is book-ended in the Season 7 episode ""Thine Own Self"", which is similar in a lot of Ways. Both Wesley in this episode and Troi in the latter are exploring the upper limits of Authority: Both are exploring the Ensigns of Command.The Enterprise enters the Selcundi-Drama sector, which has Planets like Bruce Willis: they ""Live fast and Die Hard"" - Riker tells Worf ""This is Geology, not Malevolence"" and Picard calls for his usual Conference before assigning Wesley Crusher his first Command task in finding out why these planets turn into Asteroid belts for no reason.But one of these doomed planets has an intelligent humanoid life-form, and Data starts talking to what amounts to a little girl playing with a Shortwave Radio Set.But the Planet does not have Warp Drive nor does it know about life outside of it's degenerating sphere. As Picard, says, ""Oops!""The next planet due to be destroyed is Drama IV, the planet of Data's little girl friend (Sarjenka - Nikki Cox). Will the Prime Directive be ignored? Picard decides that if the reason why these planets blow up is discovered, and a solution is forthcoming, Drama IV can be spared.Which lays a lot of responsibility on Wesley's young shoulders. And he had already saved the Enterprise from being destroyed at least twice in Season 1. Can he, and SHOULD he do it again here?I say YES. This shows Wesley as he should have been in Season 1 - Not just a snotty know-it-all kid, but a gifted kid that when given the proper tools, Instruction from the best Officers in Starfleet and a team of planetary specialists under his command, can SPEARHEAD a group of people whose working together can solve this conundrum and find a working solution. This shows that Wesley CAN believably save the day, when put into the position where he can question his own ideas of how to go about it. And to stand up to older crew-members who have a lot of experience, believing in himself and that his order for a certain difficult test was the right decision.So because Wesley stood up for himself, the people of Drama IV did not have to become a new asteroid Belt.There is also a reference to the Anne Mccaffrey ""Crystal Singer"" books- Sarjenka picks up a singing rock in Sickbay and is told by Dr Polaski that it is an Alanan Singer-Stone, and in the books the Singers basically sing the stones out of the ground.In reference to Season 7 ""Thine Own Self"", Data also saves a little girl and her immediate civilization - Only in that case, his memory gets wiped rather than the little girl's memory, as Dr Polaski does to Sarjenka here.",10
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Pen Pals (TV Episode 1989)",Picard's Dilemma,"Once again the prime directive gets put to the test. Because of the subjectivity of this directive, it is often up to the captain to be the interpreter. When Data makes contact with a young alien on a dying planet (due to geological issues) he makes a plea to Picard to save her and her family or even the whole planet. This puts the Enterprise in the position of playing god. Still, she is a child and pulls at our heartstrings. Coincidentally, Wesley is given his first significant position on the ship, leading a geological team in analyzing the planet's surface. He is torn between his given authority and the ages of those under him (he is, of course, wet behind the ears). So his issue with commanding others is his issue. The two plots eventually will come together. While I think it's sort of contrived and a little too easy for things to work out, it's a decent episode. Data's programming seems to contain a fair amount of humanity. His desires and his altruism must have been there from the start or we wouldn't have episodes like this.",8
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Pen Pals (TV Episode 1989)",Pen Pals,"I am amazed ""Pen Pals"" isn't considered one of the best Trek episodes of the entire series. I, for one, found it profoundly moving and fascinating at both ends examining the Prime Directive and how far the Enterprise is willing to go to disobey what is their fundamental method of operation in the universe, a guide that keeps the Federation from interfering in the natural order of other lifeforms and their way of life, a protection from getting involved when the risks are too great. Data has communicated with an alien girl named Sarjenka, who lives on a planet that is geologically unstable (later determined by Ensign Crusher's staff (yes, he is given his first ""trial command"" to determine what is causing planetary bodies to disrupt into little more than asteroid remains within the unmapped, uncharted sector the Enterprise is exploring, the first ship to do so) to be an imbalance in the tectonic plates of the planets). Data appeals to Picard to save her and the people on her planet from destruction. Here is where Picard's dilemma comes in: to interfere with the planet's natural order would be a violation of the Prime Directive. Do you allow a planet to die, including the people on it? Are those on board the Enterprise gods? How far can Picard go? When they listen to a plea of help from a frightened little girl to Data before he is to ""sever communication"", Picard decides, against his better judgment, to try and help save her planet. Crusher's team might have an answer While ""Pen Pals"" focuses on the Prime Directive and its purpose, with all senior officers convening in a secret meeting to determine if the Enterprise should help the planet from going in its natural path, taking a complex look at the difficulties such a decision entails, the episode also dedicates a minor subplot to Wesley Crusher, his training in understanding what it is like to have command and all that such duties require of an officer. It is just a geological survey, but Crusher does get to see what it is like to face opposition from members of his staff, challenging his order to check an ico-spectrogram; and, this is a good decision (obviously, since it is wunderkind making it), which leads to an answer as to how to correct the problem currently unstable in the planet's geological structure. Picard and Riker understand how deep their problem is as Data continues to challenge the Prime Directive in order to save Sarjenka, and the noose around their necks tighten with every step their android takes that opposes their chief method of ""law"" that keeps them out of moral entanglements. While I guess some find episodes about the Prime Directive exhausting, I love how the complexities for which the Enterprise often face when challenges against it arise (like ""Justice"" where Wesley unknowingly breaks a law that carries the sentence of death on a planet whose laws are considered ridiculous to many), the show thrusting Picard and company into psychological/emotion crises often provoking intellectual/philosophical debate. I think this is a stellar episode that deserves re-examination. Picard and Troi's scene involving animals (preferably Picard's fondness for horses) is rather illuminating regarding their banter about how creatures and humans interact with each other, curing loneliness/emptiness. Because of Data's incapability to understand emotionally the fundamental wreckage that could result from his actions, the way the situation causes stirs among his crewmates (such as his taking the child to the Bridge, as Chief O'Brien, Riker, and Picard all have issues with such a decision) adds an interesting dynamic to the story. Some great dialogue scenes include the aforementioned ""meeting of minds"" of the senior staff and Riker's talk with a concerned Wesley over the demands of a command.",10

The ship has arrived at a very unstable star system-- unstable because the planets are tearing themselves apart! The ship is there to monitor---but Data ends up changing the purpose of the mission all by himself. It seems that on the planet below which is being destroyed, Data has established voice contact with a scared little girl--and Data would like to do something to help. But, during a conference, many of the crew (including the Captain) recommend doing nothing to help, since the Prime Directive guarantees no intervention in the normal evolution of a planet and its people. So, in essence, they recommend that the Enterprise do nothing. But, Data is insistent...and the child begins calling out for help. What's next?I liked this episode because it is a wonderful example where Data shows more humanity and compassion than most of his crewmates. It helped to establish his compassion and decency and, at times, the show touched my heart. Well done and worth seeing.",7

Data contacts Picard who orders all contact to cease. We once again see the Prime Directive coming into play. Wesley suggests a procedure to his older intimidating team members and is dissuaded by their lack of enthusiasm. In a brilliant scene, he consults Riker and asks what to do. Riker gives him a needed wake up call and Wesley braces himself and orders Ensign Davies to proceed. Much to Wesley's surprise, Davies replies 'you got it!'.

The team has a philosophical discussion about what to do and decide to save the planet without telling the inhabitants.Data beams down to rescue the girl and ends up having to bring her aboard the Enterprise. The crew figures out a way to save her home planet but Picard says, for the girl's sake, they must wipe her brain with any memory of Data. Data has to say goodbye to his friend and returns her home, leaving her with a token of their brief friendship she will never remember.I didn't really have a fun time with this episode. Wes's issues with being a manager plays out like a corporate training video and the crew's moral hand-wringing over the Prime Directive is akin to a Philosophy 101 class. In the end they don't even follow it. If they have the capability to wipe memories like MIB anytime they intervene in a society, why don't they do it more often?While not a disaster, this episode did bore me a bit. Probably the most exciting but is when Data's on the planet's surface. I also like when Wes shows up and ruins the date Riker seems to be on. Besides that though, there's not a lot here.",5

0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Q Who (TV Episode 1989)",my favorite!,"How I love this episode! Of all the Next Generations, this episode is still my favorite. Words cant describe the chill that went down my spine when they first encounter the Borg in the engine room. I think what I enjoy the most about it is the fact that the producers, writers and directors seemed to be working in complete harmony with regards to every faucet of the shows production. Comparatively, there is also very little background music, which to me only heightened the tensions inherent in the scenario. In an old issue of a European film magazine, they once had an issue dedicated to ST:TNG where they had a brief synopsis of every episode as well as behind the scene stories. With regards to this episode, it was said that Patrick Stewart actually grew angry with some members of the crew because they were goofing around and not taking things more seriously. He stated that it was a particularly difficult episode to do because of the themes introduced...and the fact that for the first time there was a large number of crew killed in the storyline. He thought the fact that they were encountering an enemy that had the capability to defeat them...and was actually on the verge of doing so before Q interceded...had a profound impact on how the mood of the shoot progressed. As for myself, I enjoyed it so much because of those very reasons! In the entire history of Star Trek and through all of its incarnations, the rosy, happy or optimistic nature of the shows sometimes tended to overwhelm. This seemed to be a very realistic encounter...especially when you consider that the vast majority of the episodes or films that introduce a new species or culture invariably resolve in a very optimistic manner. Q Who simply, but effectively, went the other way and showed us a reality in which the Enterprise, and the Federation itself, was NOT up to the challenge and was very nearly doomed.Like the episode, ""Yesterday's Enterprise,"" all was not well in the universe and there was death without reason or purpose...as there is in real life. It was the first time that the Enterprise and crew had simply run out of options and/or hope of survival...and it was that theme that made the episode so strong.",10

With this episode, The Next Generation begins to come out of the shadow of its mighty predecessor, The Original Series, because the Borg will soon become as memorable as the Klingons and Romulans.

2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Q Who (TV Episode 1989)","A New ""Borg""inning","While ""Q"" drives me crazy (because of his omnipotence stealing free will from the Enterprise), this episode is still quite startling. John Delancy's character shows up demanding to be made part of the crew. Picard can see nothing positive about this. He rejects the great one's offer and the next thing we know, the ship is sent 700 light years from there, into another quadrant that should not have been explored for years. Q continues to taunt the crew and Picard holds firm. It's probably that he sees the reality that if he relents, there is no purpose any more. The sad thing is that the Enterprise now meets the Borg, one of the most creative entities produced in fiction. They, of course, are a bee-like culture where there is a collective rather than individuals. They act in concert rather than alone. They are also a humorless juggernaut, beyond reason, whose sole purpose is to absorb other species and add this information to their collective. When attacked and damaged, they move quickly to repair and move on their insidious journey. Unfortunately, in the process of investigating this thing, a number of crew members are killed.

I could understand their apprehension, but in this episode, Q is annoyed by their rebuff and so he decides to show them a taste of what lies ahead...a VERY good thing, actually. In this case, he introduces the ship to the Borg--a race no one in the Federation had heard of and did not anticipate. Their who 'seek out new life' motto is tried to the max, as the Borg really don't want to be friends--they just want to take the Enterprise and turn it and the crew into their slaves. In future episodes of this and other Star Trek series, the Borg would begin an all-out war with the Federation as well as practically everyone else (including the Romulans). I loved this storyline and it gave the shows a nice overarching enemy and theme. It also provided a wonderful Star Trek movie, where Picard has his ultimate showdown with the Borg. To me, this is a highlight of the series and one where Q shows he COULD be very helpful-- but yet STILL the crew (and especially Picard) seem to despise him.

What we do have in this episode are the coolest most chilling cyber zombies ever dreamt up, enter The Borg! (Have to mention Alfre Woodard's line from First Contact 'Sounds Swedish'). This episode also sees more of the enigmatic Guinan who we all know is more than she appears to be. Not only does she have chilling recollections of her own encounters of the Borg but on some level she seems to frighten even Q. Intriguing, as Data would say. The Borg waste no time in attacking the ship and for the first time Picard and his ask first and shoot later crew are forced to deal with an enemy they cannot bargain with, reason with or think their way out of a confrontation with. They have to fight and it is a fight they cannot win. Personally I think I would have been screaming at Worf to fire every weapon I had while the Borg were dissecting the ship and killing 18 of my crew mates but that's me. Also whilst I had the Borg incapacitated I would not be sending my most valuable crew members over there but firing everything I had left and then warp nining it away from there but again that's me and Picard obviously had other ideas. Apart from a few flaws this is easily the best episode so far and renewed hope for most Trekkers that the show was improving on some of the awful Season 1 & 2 turkeys. This episode also lined the way for the best of both worlds, First Contact and some of the best Star Trek Voyager episodes made. It was the Borg that assimilated me into becoming a die hard TNG fan.",10

But he also did us a hidden favor.The Borg were apparently coming anyway and now we know what we'd be up against, or at least know that they are out there. in my opinion it was more than a ""kick in our complacency"". this episode had at least one other interesting feature.I found myself disagreeing with the protagonists. Picard said it was ""not smugness not arrogance!"", but that's what it seemed like to me. OK I'd seen the other Borg episodes before this one so I KNEW they weren't ready. I realize that I am giving a lower rating than my comment might indicate but there is some really dull and ultimately pointless stuff in the episode before Q shows up. it is unfortunate that the ""dealings"" were never explained. The ending is great! 3 of 5 stars. And what happened to the Borg not having a single leader.",8
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Q Who (TV Episode 1989)",Overrated Contribed Episode (spoilers),"I like the Borg as much as anyone else. But the characters in this episode make decisions that don't make sense, which is bad writing. Picard asks Guinnea for advice and then ignores her when she tells him not to enter the ship. The ship barely survives an assault, and then instead of leaving, They decide to have a conference while parked right by the dangerous ship, and then board the ship. This was made so just to see the inside of the ship, which was cool, but writing needs to make sense for me to rate something very high. They episode is nonetheless suspenseful and intriguing because the Borg are awesome, but this is by no means a great Borg episode if you care about story logic.",6

relentless and monolithic Borg for the first time.It's quite an encounter with this square shaped space ship handled by a crew
of half carbon based humanoids and half robotic all part of the same mind and
obeying one will. All the Borg want is technology. To try it, absorb it and
absorb those who have it in their singular collective.This was the first of many encounters with the Borg in this and subsequent

While I value its importance to the series, I don't think it's a fantastic episode. All the stuff with Geordi and the new ensign you can immediately throw out. Their scenes together are quite annoying. I also feel that they write Picard to be a bit too hubristic, more so than his actual character is. I think Q was right in showing them the dangers of the universe but Captain Picard makes a few head-scratching decisions. Beaming aboard their vessel when they had time to flee was an absolutely insane decision. Even with Guinan giving them the low down, they ignore the most knowledgeable person aboard and go on ahead like their invincible. It bugged me a bit.Still this episode introduces the Borg and does a good job of showing off their capabilities. This won't be the last we heard from these folks.",7
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Q Who (TV Episode 1989)",as a guide..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 02With new smart ideas, compelling dramatic pieces and ethical dilemmas that makes you think twice, the second round of this enterprise crew is surely an improvement where more diversity and maturity is visible.Q WhoIt is witty as the antagonist always outsmarts our in house team the result is a nail biting ping-pong game where the ball goes back and forth in each court, plus it is always fun to see familiar faces on the wrong side of the door.",
10,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Q Who (TV Episode 1989)",Q gives humanity a painful lesson...or is it a helpful warning?,"You must forgive me for being uncharacteristically ebullient but I adore this episode. TNG was pretty light, colorful and happy, ending every episode with the usual love-in before warping away without any follow-up. The set-up may be original here and there, but the wrap- up is often easy to guess. But here, the writers take us on a completely unpredictable sleigh ride without really a happy ending.Plot (SPOILERS) Q offers to become part of the crew to help prepare the Enterprise (and the Federation) for what awaits them. Picard, not without reason, rejects him and Q transports them, ship and all, to an uncharted region of space. Here they are confronted by the Borg, an eerie race of cyberzombies interested only in whatever they can use to improve themselves. In a way, they are a bio-mechanical locust. Picard tries to make first contact, but the Borg aren't listening. Fleeing, the crew realize that they are hopelessly outmatched and unprepared. Picard acknowledges this and pleads for Q's help, who restores their original heading and leaves a wounded and humiliated Enterprise.Good Stuff I like Q but even if you hate him he is highly tolerable in this episode and there are some great Q-Guinan and Q-Picard scenes. The Borg are TNG's finest addition to the Trek galaxy. The Borg cube is equally alien and menacing inside and outside. For once the Enterprise is outgunned and takes ""a bloody nose"". Picard realizes that now the Borg know of the Federation's existence, they will be coming, ending the episode on a uncomfortable note.Things I disliked Erm......I guess you could call a cubic space ship impractical. And erm...you may question their decision to hold while the Borg ship is regenerating, as opposed to just bombarding the thing with every torpedo in your arsenal and then making a run for it. But the only real bad stuff is that we do not, in later episodes, return to some questions, such as whatever happened between Q and Guinan in the past or some emotional pay-off to the 18 dead crew-members. Or that they ruin the Borg by making them more individualistic.Conclusion But that is just being petty, this is a great episode and (depending on how you view Datalore) the first real TNG classic. It sets up the equally brilliant Best of Both Worlds and decent Family as well as the fine movie First Contact. Q is wonderful in this episode, as is Guinan. Some beautiful directing and a constant feeling that this is very different from what we've come to expect from TNG. 10/10 for originality and introducing the Borg and not ending on a sickly sweet note.PS I end with this interesting notion: rather than just Q acting out or proving a good point to Picard, is it not possible that Q, who as an omniscient being will have foreseen either the Borg or Domionion (or both) attacking the Federation, may actually have intended for the Federation to stop being so optimistic and arm themselves so as not to be wiped away? Which would make his motivation at least honorable?",10
11,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Q Who (TV Episode 1989)",Star Trek The Next Generation--Q Who?,"What I think Q Who does exceptionally well is utilize the Q character to not only establish one of the Federation's (and Picard's & Enterprise's) most fearsome threats in the Borg but further establish how this obnoxious, annoying, obtrusive entity can often provoke the Enterprise crew (and, in particular, Picard) to address their weaknesses and human/humanoid frailties, and how not every situation can perhaps be intellectually/philosophically/cleverly handled (including the use of dialogue to thwart death and destruction by ""talking it out""). Q wants to join the Enterprise crew as an officer, even telling Picard he would give up his powers and become mortal. Picard doesn't trust him and says he doesn't want Q's help in regards to what lies ahead in the far reaches of space. Q wants to teach Picard and his crew a lesson in humility regarding how prepared they are against unknown lifeforms who could pose a serious danger to them if unready. Q is right in that Picard and the Enterprise are not ready for the Borg. Q Who introduces the Borg as a force to be reckoned with as they have better technology and their function as a collective affords them to work as a singular unit of humanoids with artificial intelligence that operates only to take what is of interest to them to continually build their power and strength. Q just waves a hand and sends the Enterprise forwarding away of their current position and right into the trajectory of the Borg Cube's tractor beam. Dissecting a piece of the Enterprise saucer section hull, damaging their shields, and even boarding the ship, studying defense capabilities in the Engineering section, the Borg are not only intimidating in appearance but have the advantage in advanced technology and are only concerned with what they can take and use. This was an early precursor to what lies ahead: The Best of Both Worlds Part 1 & 2, considered by Trek faithful to be the greatest double-header of Star Trek period (not just Next Gen). I think it is fascinating how it is often forgotten that Q was responsible for introducing Picard and the Enterprise to the Borg. Q was just miffed that Picard didn't want him and his powers, hurling them into a section of space they had not ventured. Another intriguing development is that Guinan and Q know each other and are definite enemies. Guinan's race was nearly wiped out by the Borg and the part of space the Enterprise finds itself she warns they must escape or else. Q refers to Guinan as a creature that isn't as she appears and only bad things follow her. She never is what Q insists and often is a voice of reason and comfort, of wisdom and insight, to the Enterprise crew. Q does seem admirable of Picard when the Captain pleads for him to help them; it shows that Picard isn't above putting aside his pride and recognizing the greater welfare of his ship and officers (and their families). In hindsight, Picard does tell Guinan that Q, even if for the wrong reasons, may have benefited the Enterprise in their first meeting with the Borg; foreshadowing the inevitable, The Enterprise now know that the Borg is coming and preparing for them should be a major priority. Seeing the Enterprise crew assured and convinced they could face whatever beings they encountered on their own, with Q actually proving them wrong (Q had been the one set straight prior to this episode), is quite interesting. Sometimes Picard and company are wrong; while Q aggravates and antagonizes, he was in the right in this situation. His help was needed and Picard's life would be changed forever by meeting the Borg.",9

Number One must confront these characters since the Captain is incapacitated.

Shortly after the Captain leaves, the Enterprise receives a distress call from the Pakleds.

However, when Troi learns that they are dealing with the Pakled, she is worried as she sees these beings as very deceitful and they are NOT as dumb as they've been acting.

I just wish they'd give me a chance to rewrite the dialog, and give the characters more chance to actually express some intelligence, and not move through the scenes like robots.

Fairly interesting exchanges between the Captain and Wesley...they even bond to a small degree! The other plot/subplot involves a distress call from a ship which needs it's guidance system repaired. They act and appear to be quite mentally challenged which might seem to be a ruse. Geordi goes over to fix the problem and is taken hostage afterward so that the Pakleds can use him to ""make us smart."" I seriously question how the Pakleds EVER got into space. They look more suited to be a, uh, I don't know what to call it but certainly not able to figure out how to make a space ship!!! Oh, and in case I thought they might be trying to pretend to be mentally challenged, after Geordi gives them what they need they are all excited: ""Now we are strong!""

The episode places Riker in quite a conundrum as he must figure out a way to get transport ability to beam Geordi out of there but the Pakleds' shields are quite impressive (obviously stolen using a similar scheme by using their intellectually inferior features and speech to lure advanced races into their trap to build up a better weapons and engine technology so they can compete with others in space) and they continue to use his own phaser to harm him (even on stun, multiple blasts will do considerable damage). Plain and simple, Riker and company will have to outsmart them by developing a ruse they will fall for due to their limited mental acuity. Meanwhile, we have a bit of bonding between Picard and Crusher as the two travels on a six-hour trip on the Shuttlecraft. The twist regarding who saves Picard when his procedure becomes life-threatening is important in how the Captain views privacy, wanting his physical injury to remain secret, and not entrusted in the hands of a capable doctor (it is a matter of not wanting his body visually viewed by those who serve with him, considering such intimate knowledge burdensome to his image!) who will see him subdued and ""naked"". Anyway, it is nice that Picard shares a story from his past as it contributes to why he must have surgery and details that he wasn't always so disciplined, and having a ""moment"" with Crusher conveys a kind of paternal aspect to their time alone on the Shuttlecraft. Seeing Riker on his own, depending on his crew for possible answers to get Geordi back, it shows how great a Captain he would be when the time was right. That said, the Pakleds aren't exactly the scariest foes the Enterprise has encountered (the use of their inferiority to gain advantage on those superior is fascinating, don't you think?), and anyone who believes Picard would perish in a surgery during only the second season certainly is easily gullible. The ending is wrapped up all nice and neat, but the Pakleds storyline's conclusion is a bit uninspired as if it was merely making up padded time for Picard and Wesley's trip.",6

The Pakleds actually have a fairly unique design but the plot involving them is just really dumb and boring. It is amusing to watch Geordi get tossed around via the phaser's stun feature. He really gets some air!I couldn't care less about Wed and Picard bounding, not do I understand Picard's prideful decision to not let Pulaski do the surgery, despite her being the most qualified doctor around. Wesley continues to annoy me.The one GREAT scene of this episode is Picard relaying the story behind why he has heart issues involving a bar fight with some Nausicaans during his youth. Stewart's acting here is pretty spectacular and this one scene really saves the entire episode from being a complete disaster.One other thought: Riker makes a series of bad decisions here.

Even being of Irish descent myself, I found the episode lightweight and rather funny in most parts.My biggest problem with this installment was a scientific plot hole: If the Mariposans were such accomplished cloning scientists, they would have known - even 300 years ago! - about replicative fading and preserved tissue samples from the ORIGINAL settlers from which they could have cloned their entire population. Also, if they (the originals) had had a few children and took samples from them as well, they would have had a larger genetic ""library"" to work with. Of course, had this issue been addressed, the entire third act of the show would have fallen apart so I guess I see why it was written the way it was.My other gripe about this episode was how bleedin' long it took the Enterprise conference to realize the Bringloidis were the perfect solution to the Mariposan's problem.

It starts with a tender moment between Worf and Pulaski, which is really quite nice. Shortly thereafter, a distress call comes from a planet that is in grave danger. Huge solar prominences exude from the sun and will soon fry the planet. Living underground are a group of expatriate Irish farmers. They have all the stereotypical traits (no leprechauns, thank God) of the Irish. They are hot tempered, promiscuous, and drink heavily. Because Riker can think of nothing else, the whole gang is beamed onto the Enterprise, along with their chickens, pigs, and other assorted livestock. The dominant figure is a young Colleen who ends up sexually involved with Riker. I wonder where the prime directive goes on this one. These people need a planet, but where or where will they go (I would have inserted a scene from Riverdance and brought them to a planet that evolved from Broadway musicals.Another call comes in to distract us from this disaster. Now we have another evolutionary society. This one had most of their crew killed upon entry to the planet, leaving five scientists to survive. Since propagating the planet isn't a possibility given the circumstances, the scientist have developed the ability to clone themselves. Unfortunately, as Pulaski points out, as they make copy after copy, recessive traits form and ultimately, the society will die out. They request fresh DNA from the Enterprise crew and actually kidnap Pulaski and Riker, sucking some epithelials from them. This is dirty pool and must be dealt with properly. They are doomed.

However, when the crew reads through the ship's manifest which brought the people to the planet, some of the things don't fit--as if there were two totally different colonies.

I am pretty sure Irish folks seeing this show would NOT be pleased that they are shown as a bunch of drunken slobs...but that's is how they behave. As for the other group on a nearby planet, they are scientific and much more advanced...but they are also dying as a race. What's next? A love connection...This was a rather poor episode.

3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Up the Long Ladder (TV Episode 1989)",The most offensive episode of Star Trek,"I am not exaggerating here. The episode starts out OK. There is a really nice moment with Pulaski and Worf and you find yourself thinking: Pulaski is pretty cool. And Worf is always the best part of any episode. However even those ten minutes cannot save what is the worst episode of Star Trek, possibly the worst episode of television. So the premise starts with the crew rescuing this non-tech savvy civilization from a planet because their sun is exploding. But why are they Irish? Since they are Irish, they have to be lazy drunks too. This is the first offensive aspect of the episode. Seriously, there is no reason to make them Irish.OK so they have these podunk Irish people and it causes some comic relief. Ha ha? Then they run into a society on another planet who has to clone themselves because they can't procreate any more. Then in a bizarre twist, the society steals Riker and Pulaski's DNA and makes clones and Riker shoots them and ...what? Offensive to clones! The repercussions of basically murdering another human are not even discussed. It's like...CLONES...EVIIILLLL.In another bizarre twist, Picard decides the only way to end this terrible episode is to get the two societies together, and force the women to procreate with multiple partners. They tell the societies they have to forget monogamous marriage. Because each woman has to have 3 children with 3 different men. OK so basically...the women get to have babies for like 50 years, and the men get to have multiple partners. The stupid thing is, first the fiery Irish woman is like...""Picard, WTF? I don't want to have babies for the rest of my life."" I was like, right on sister! Then she is like...""Oh look at that rich dude! Hey there, want to wash my feet?"" Offensive to women AND men now.I won't even mention the incredibly stupid sex scene between Riker and the head podunk Irish woman. She was wearing an underskirt. Enough said.If you are curious...sure, watch it. No, don't watch it. It's that bad. So lets see here. The episode was offensive to Irish people, redheads, men, women, clones, Star Trek fans, doctors, lawyers, viewers. Am I missing anyone here?",1

What they encounter is a carnal farm community, with goats and pigs, prone to strong drink and lasciviousness, hard workers and loud, Picard and company certainly find an eye-opening experience they couldn't have possibly imagined. With the happy-go-lucky, chatty leader of the bunch, Danilo Odell (Barrie Ingham, his Irish accent and hearty personality quite a hoot to behold) and his opinionated, confrontational, bluntly to-the-point daughter, Brenna (Rosalyn Landor), the group, on board the Enterprise, making do in the cargo hold, seek a home elsewherewhere will this ""people from a whole different era in Earth"" find their new home? The story doesn't stop here. There was a second group of people who left Earth, boarding the Mariposa, more technologically advanced, but sexually impotent, dependent upon cloning to survive on their world (similar in look to Saturn), desiring DNA from officers on board the Enterprise because the process which gave them generations no longer works. So desperate for survival, this group, led by Prime Minister Granger (Jon DeVries), actually stun Riker and Pulaski, taking epithelial cells while they are unconscious, with plans to use their clones to help populate their dying world! Certainly, Riker and Pulaski take offense. This episode does have an anti-cloning feel, raising the defense that our individuality is what makes us unique and by cloning each person, you remove such qualities. I agree with this sentiment, although I recognize this will not be shared by some in the scientific community who see benefits in the cloning process (cloning animal life for food purposes in a starving world, as one such example). Anyway, this episode is indeed a showcase for the fiery Landor who shouts and orders around others, commanding and authoritative, certainly appealing to Riker who is attracted to her. Worf has a nice subplot where he offers Pulaski, out of respect for not telling others that his fainting on the bridge was due to Klingon measles (!), a tea ceremony for which pleases her immensely. This is an extremely entertaining diversion from the norm, but not essential viewing for Trek fans by any means.",6

One was supplied with old-timey gear and barnyard animals. They're basically a space Amish colony with Irish accents. The other had a bunch of tech and is a modern society. The only problem is that they didn't have enough surviving members to thrive and now have to make clones of those who remain. They've made too many copies of copies and are in danger of dying out without a fresh stock of DNA. The Enterprise brings the two colonies together so both can thrive and learn from one another.This episode has a weird slapstick comedy vibe to it. The take where the horribly racist portrayal of an Irishman takes a swig of Klingon liquor and his eyes cross is probably the most ridiculous scene in any TNG episode so far. Riker leering at this woman really creeps me out too.The one good scene and really cool set design is when Riker destroys his and Pulaski's clone. The way they just wordlessly carry it out is pretty chilling. The hairless clones and the tanks they are in just look super cool.I also like the Klingon tea ceremony bit. This is possibly the best Pulaski scene we've gotten thus far.Other than these two standouts, this episode is filled with a bunch of junk. It's not good but it's not as offensively bad as say ""The Child"". Season 2 has definitely had its ups and downs.",4

It's like the writers had a checklist of every negative stereotype about Irish people, and they went the extra step in not just checking off all of the boxes --they used English ACTORS to portray the Irish ""rabble."" I've been on a marathon binge of the show during the last month. Am I going to see Turkish actors portraying Armenians as idiots next? Also, the cloning plot was painfully obtuse. Picard (not an exact quotation, but it should be): ""They just abducted two of my crew members, forcefully extracted their DNA then forced them to kill their clone selves. Hmmmm.. How can I HELP them now? I KNOW: I have some extra sacks of DNA laying around in the form of these Irish farmhands. That's the ticket."" Horrible episode.

Again, Lwaxana (in her first appearance since the 1st season) asks Captain Picard to carry her very heavy luggage - but this time it's Riker who carries. Again, her assistant Carel Struycken as the very funny Mr. Homn is with her - and yet again he drinks alcohol like it's water. And again, while Picard and Lwaxana eat dinner, Mr. Homn rings every time Lwaxana eats!

Watch this funny episode.Trivia: Dixon Hill makes his second appearance in the series.

1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Manhunt (TV Episode 1989)",No...NOT Dixon Hill!,"""Manhunt"" is obviously intended as a funny episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". Because of this, its mood is very light and not much of importance occurs in this one. Soon after some weird, fishlike zombie delegates arrive aboard, the Enterprise is overtaken by a shuttlecraft. Its passenger is the obnoxious Lawaxana Troi and she has apparently been appointed an ambassador as well--and wants to be transported by the Enterprise to some conference. However, her real reason for being there is that she's incredibly horny--the result of some weird Betazoid mid-life crisis where their women become sex machines--and this machine is running at 10,000 rpms/minute! The worst part is that she insists that Picard is in love with her--when he clearly isn't. So, he runs and hides inside the holodeck--posing as his pulp novel hero, Dixon Hill. Unfortunately for the episode, Picard goes into the holodeck and poses as Dixon Hill!!! While I could enjoy Lwaxana's crazy shenanigans, the holodeck stuff is, as usual, completely out of place and irrelevant to the show. Overall, not a particularly good episode and one that should have been better. But, at least Patrick Stewart looked great in a fedora!",4
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Manhunt (TV Episode 1989)",Manhunt,"""Manhunt"" is basically another Next Gen episode catering to Mrs. Roddenberry, who is always a hoot although it doesn't really add anything particularly interesting to the show itself, although she does get to save a specific admiral's conference from being blown to smithereens by assassins (they look like Fish Creatures) masquerading as delegates with potential in joining the Federation. Lwaxana Troi (Majel Barrett) is going through ""the phase"", something akin to human female menopause, except in her case overcharged sex drive (!), looking for a mate aboard the Enterprise to marry. That's pretty much it for the exception of following Picard (hiding from Lwaxana who eyes him as a possible suitor!) on the Holodeck in the fictional role of a private detective before WWII, Dix, and his desire to have a comfortable time of it before the ship reaches the planet of the conference. This is essentially an episode that is playful and undemanding on an intellectual level, allowing Barrett to have fun with her bluntly honest, toxically aggressive Lwaxana character. If anything, it was hilarious seeing Deanna squirm when Lwaxana abruptly declares her marriage to Riker without his knowledge! Worf's moments with the Fish Creature Delegates (he considers them a handsome race!), including a scene with Wesley, are some of my favorites during the episode. Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) wanting Troi to allow Picard to get out of his dinner engagement with Lwaxana, without her help, is also pretty funny (it comments on the hunt, the hunted and the hunter). The Antedeans are a fascinating creation, I must say, and their catatonic incubation period, the feeding frenzy that erupts once they awaken, and the constant references to them keeps them alive during the episode when it could have been completely overwhelmed by Lwaxana. Seeing Lwaxana talk to the computer, asking for directions to the Holodeck to find Picard (the computer is her voice!), is simply surreal...",5

But, for me, the appearance of Lwaxana Troi is a bit much. Her character is insufferable as she blusters her way around the ship, making precious comments, teasing Picard. If you remember the Joanne Worley character from Rowan and Martin's Laugh In, she has a similar personality. In this one she is going through Betazoid menopause and is searching for a mate. Picard is her first choice, but as she goes along, it appears that anything with two legs will do. She even looks askance at Wesley, but, thank god, that plot line doesn't develop. She focuses on Riker and even Worf. Meanwhile, there is subplot as Picard hides in the holodeck, playing a guy named Dix who is a Humphrey Bogart prototype private eye. The crew tries to cover for him as Lwaxana makes her merry way around the ship. The other event going on is the arrival of a couple of ""frozen fish"" who will be thawed out when they reach the planet where a conference is taking place.

By the end of the episode, I knew that I was correct. She wore out whatever modicum of charm that she had in the first episode of this series in which she appeared as Deanna's mom Lwaxana Troi. Now, as I'm looking at her IMDb credits, I've noticed that she appears as Lwaxana several more times beyond this show. Help me. It's bizarre that they had two episodes in a row in which the crew is entertaining such irreverent people (the other: ""Up the Long Ladder"") so close to their first encounter with the Borg. One might suspect that after they were eye-to-eye with humanity's potential apocalypse the show would shift to a slightly graver tone. But it's obviously not the case.

The writers use the same mind reading jokes for her they did the first time around. We waste a bit of time in the holodeck to flesh out the episode. The whole subplot with the fish people gets revealed to be a terrorist plot at the end of the episode in the most casual way possible.

This episode is a definite showcase for Plakson, who is very sexy, opinionated, clever, and passionate—just the right compliment to the shielded, guarded, stone-faced, but equally passionate Worf (she is half Klingon-half Human which allows her to understand both facets of a once warring set of races). Easily the best scene is the extended Holodeck Calisthenics sequence where Worf and K'Ehleyr battle imaginary monsters in a fight program, coming to terms with their feelings for one another (Worf even recites the mating-marriage oath for which K'Ehleyr will not accept). I got a kick out of one scene where a very ""unsettled"" (as Picard put it, I call it ""his feathers were ruffled"") gets a bit honorary with Picard and the Captain gives him a very stern look of admonishment that settles the Lieutenant back into his place. Say what you want about Picard but he will not accept insubordination from the officers under his command. The trick Worf has to countermand what could be a difficult decision Picard will not accept (destroying the Klingons if they insist on carrying out orders and war ideals instilled in them from the bygone century) is a doozy! Marina Sirtis (Troi) and Plakson have marvelous chemistry, and the passion exuded between Plakson and Dorn is commendable. One of the best episodes, for my money, in the second season.

Apparently, career paths have gotten in the way in the past, and Worf is not forgiving. It's no secret that these two are going to get together at some point. The reason for an emissary has to do with a Klingon warship that has its crew in suspended animation. Because they entered this state before the Federation made alliances with Klingon, they will wake up thinking there is still war between the two camps. It's a little like the Japanese soldiers in the Philippines who were isolated and thought that World War II was still in progress. Anyway, what they must deal with is the distrust that could lead to an all-out assault by the Klingons before reason can be restored. There are some interesting negotiations that take place.

The show also indicates early that Worf has a bit of a past with her character. It was intriguing to see that past get rehashed and watch their relationship develop and evolve. This episode is definitely one of my faves from season two.

The show begins with an emissary from the Federation arriving at the Enterprise. However, speed is of the utmost importance, so this agent is sent in a tiny coffin-like machine flying at warp 9! Worf is surprised when out of the device walks K'Ehleyr--a woman he knows and who is of human and Klingon parentage. It's very obvious that they have a past--but what it is you'll have to see as the episode progresses. As to why she's there, it turns out that a ship filled with Klingon warriors has been in suspended animation for decades--well before the Empire joined the Federation. So, the worry is that when they awaken, they'll once again renew attacks on Federation space...needlessly killing untold innocent people.As I said, it's a Worf episode and spends time allowing his character to grow and evolve.

With no Klingon ship's nearby, it's up to the Enterprise to explain to the Klingon ship's crew the peace Accord that has been put in place since their time. Coming aboard to help with this mission is a half human/half Klingon emissary who also happens to be an old romantic interest of Worf.I'm not always the biggest fan of Star Trek's romantic subplots but I think this one really works well. The antagonism between the two, the passion with which this warriors race of people interact, Worf's commitment to the culture and customs of his people, it all works.Worf always seems like he's posturing a bit to be seen as a true Klingon, especially in this episode. While K'Ehleyr sort of embraces her half human side (her sense of humor for example), Worf clings really hard to Klingon culture. As a Klingon raised by human parents, I think he overdoes it a bit with his strict following of Klingon customs. In this episode he pushes for a marriage to K'Ehleyr after their romantic rendezvous in the holodeck. K'Ehleyr isn't quite ready to make that commitment.I think the two actors play really well off of one another. Their relationship takes center stage, putting the sleepy Klingon issue on the back burner. It is resolved in a fun little way though. I love Worf's costume and script as he pretends to be captain.

The bad thing is that both ships have had their weapons systems eliminated for the duration of the game, leaving the possibility open for an attack. Who should show up but the Ferengi. They throw a monkey wrench into things but, in the process, challenge the two captains to face a real threat without any weapons.There is a subplot as well, as Data loses some of his confidence due to his performance against an arrogant overseer of the games.

3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Peak Performance (TV Episode 1989)",Peak Performance,"In a Starfleet Battle Simulation (""war games""), Picard reluctantly agrees to have the Enterprise engage a limited battle cruiser with barely any warp capability and inferior in terms of technology and weapons. It is all about how the captain of this cruiser equips himself during the simulation and is able to get much out of so little, the crew's response to his command, that even though they have such inferior, insufficient means at their disposal, ingenuity and creativity (and maybe even a little cheating as Wesley Crusher sneaks out a little invention he has been working on to help boost warp ability because the ship has minuscule dilithium crystals on hand) can help them gain some semblance of an advantage, perhaps a trick or two to help their cause, over a superior opponent. Worf's idea of tricking the Enterprise's sensors (including their view screen) into believing an enemy ship is approaching with weapons firing and a surprise ""warp jump"" concoction invented by Geordi and Wesley could both benefit the battle cruiser. What adds excitement to this premise is that a Ferengi battleship, a *real* Ferengi battleship, attacks the Enterprise who has ""disengaged"" certain weapons functions in order to compensate for no firing upon the Federation battle cruiser, leaving them at a disadvantage with shields weakened after much phaser fire. How Picard—and Riker—get themselves out of this jam is a nice bit of chicanery where brains outwits greed (the Ferengi are devious, but not exactly the most smartest species in the Trek universe), which does include Worf's aforementioned trick, as well as, a bit of manipulation using the warp jump idea and an explosion. Deceiving the enemy and gaining the upper hand when the deck is stacked against you is a strategy often used in war when all hope seems lost and the outlook is grim. Meanwhile, an alien ""war strategist"", on board to assist Picard and Riker through their war games exercise is reputed to be the best at a game known as Strategma, defeating Riker with relative ease and even Data, causing the android Commander to doubt his abilities as an effective officer on board the Bridge when called upon to make a decision. Roy Brocksmith is a hoot as the Zakdorn strategist, slumping figure, dropping facial features, completely self-assured and supremely confident in his understandings of what it takes to win a war and the important aspects of commanding a ship engaged in battle when the dependence on gaining an edge when none seems to exist is essential in leading your crew to victory. Picard admits here he wanted to conduct the exercise in preparation for a Borg attack, to have his crew battle ready if the time comes. I love a lot of the little scenes such as Riker approaching Worf in his quarters about joining his crew on board the Hathaway, the moments inside the old vessel as the crew powers it up and makes repairs (the doubt there that they have even the slightest chance of winning the exercise), and Picard's acknowledgments of Riker's skills as an officer (even telling Brocksmith that Riker is the finest officer he's ever worked with).",9

The problem is that Kolrami is also a big butt- head--with an arrogance that makes him difficult to say the least. The reason that Kolrami is on the Enterprise is that he is to supervise a war game between the ship and an older, mothballed ship, the Hathaway. Riker is given command of this other ship and creates a crew for it from Enterprise staff. But, given that the Hathaway is old, has no warp drive and is at a huge disadvantage is most every way, the odds against Riker are tremendous. What's worse-- Kolrami has complete contempt for Riker and his strategic skills.

The whole 'Wesley is gonna do something shady so we can Kobayashi Maru';
Well, it would have been TONS better if - get this,
If they performed the Picard Maneuver on him!!!

That would have been cool. it would have worked.#2
I think this is even better.
The alien dude that beat Data at that game the first time and then Capt Picard told him to 'suck it up buttercup' and Data won the 2nd time; nah.
Instead of Wesley dumpsterdiving on the Enterprise, how cool would it have been if Wesley had a talk with data and said 'hey, you know how you can't try to win in tic tac toe?'
Data would take a sec to make sure.
Then nobody could beat him in the game, that's a much better way.Thank you for reading my humble review.",8

This is the first time the Ferengi pose an actual threat, it only took them two full seasons!Why the Enterprise needs to battle against a derelict old ship to prepare for the Borg is beyond me though.

However, this is no mere scratch--the thing festers and cannot be eliminated using the transporter's bio-filters. Soon, Riker is dying and Dr. Pulaski is fighting to save his life. This doesn't sound that bad, does it? Well, no...the concept isn't bad. However, this only takes up a tiny fraction of the show. Most of it consists of clips of Riker from other episodes--and they appear to be completely random in how they are used. Relevant or not--they are tossed into ""Shades of Gray"" and the sum effect is a show that obviously no one gave a crap about when they made it. A complete waste of time and the worst simply because there have been episodes with dumber premises (such as the baseball game episode from ""Deep Space 9""), but at least they TRIED something different with these shows. Here, it's just an attempt to re-use old footage and otherwise take the week off from production! Awful.UPDATE: By the way, it isn't just me who hated this episode.

The entire amount of time devoted to new scenes (largely, those with Diana Muldaur, Marina Sirtis and Jonathan Frakes on the sickbay set) is about 15 minutes. The rest is all clips from previous episodes. Surely the director could have found a away to squeeze out of the budget a few extra ""new scenes"" that would have been ""Riker specific"" flashbacks. Perhaps they could have used alternate takes or different camera angles of those same previous scenes (I'm sure at least some existed), or possibly even re-filmed some of the same scenes with the actors.Frankly, I just see this episode (when it was first broadcast and still today) as a complete mess, a real cop-out, and a very depressing way to have ended the 2nd season..",1

It is beyond the expertise of Dr. Pulaski, who can't stop it. Scans reveal that it has attacked the nervous system and will eventually head for the brain and kill Riker. What Pulaski and Troi find is that the entity is reactive to human emotions. Troi is there to read Riker's thoughts as he dreams. She senses different kinds of dreams from adventure to erotic to pain to terror. All these are represented by short clips from the first two seasons. There is no order to them, but Pulaski is able to use drugs to enhance the experiences. Troi, whom we all know is in love with Will, coaches the doctor as they search. It was fun to guess what scenes might fit in, but it detracted from the actually presentation.

As we say where I work, it is what it is. Riker's life hangs by a slender thread after encountering an infection that is attracted to nerves, the source a thorn from a predatory vine during a geological survey on an unexplored planet. So Riker lays on a sick bay bed, unconscious, as a head device allows Pulaski to monitor the progress of the infection, trying to find a way to stop it from spreading to his brain, ultimately, of course, wanting to kill it. It seems that negative emotions, negative endorphins during dreams seem to repel the infection, actually even stopping it from completely overtaking Riker's brain. Riker's health reacting to emotions is the excuse for the scenes featured in ""Shades of Grey"". Passionate, horrifying, sad, violent: each emotional memory has a positive or negative reaction that influences the infection in one way or another. There are some decent moments, some good humorous touches, especially involving Picard and Riker (one scene at Data's expense at the end), but a brunt of the episode has Pulaski, concerned and calm, hypothesizing and theorizing, while Troi remains emotionally invested in the welfare of her Imzadi.

Star Trek is the greatest television phenomenon ever achieved.""Shades of Grey"" is the first recap episode in the TNG series. Having just watched the shows, these clips were fresh in my mind, but I noticed how a couple of them were re-shot because the film looked better. Season 1 always seemed real dark and ugly to me - and the actors looked silly, like they didn't fit in their own skins.The show is essentially just made of up a greatest hits of the happiest and saddest moments in Riker's life on the Enterprise up until this point. The Data and Riker scene in the holo-deck is a classic moment of new friendship. My other favorite is when the 2nd officer on the Klingon ship challenges Riker's authority as first officer and Riker beat the living CRAP out of that Klingon. Then the admiral kicks his a$$ but good. This entire episode is a heck of a reminder that a LOT of crazy, great things have happened already in a mere 2 seasons with 5 more to go and a handful of movies! At this point in the series they are really starting to develop the emotions that tie Riker to Deanna Troi as Imzadi. Up until this point they have mentioned the fact, but they have yet to exploit it. Let the record show that the ST Wiki - Memory Alpha claims that Imzadi means ""first"" and denotes that she has had intimate relations with Riker and also remains deeply close on an emotional one. This episode further proves there will be a tense romantic interest in each other for a long time to come.Here is the article: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Imzadi By this point in the series, production value is up to speed and Star Trek TNG is settling into the sci-fi behemoth it was destined to become.

Basically it was a re-hash of what were considered the most important/interesting events during a season. And that's what this episode is, except it's from the viewpoint of one character only. Of course some people will find this worth watching while others, perhaps a majority, will loathe such episodes, as do I.Another ""must have"" episode was the ""amnesic"" ones where a character would forget who they were, usually due to a knock on the head. I actually enjoyed these sometimes as they often included humour.Thankfully most modern TV has left these old dogs behind.",1
18,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Shades of Gray (TV Episode 1989)",Limited Flashbacks,"What I think made this episode bad was the fact that Riker's flashbacks were only limited to his last 2 years on the Enterprise. This was probably because the budget was very low at the time and so they can only recap earlier episodes. I think they should have hired younger actors to play a young version of Riker as a boy during his boyhood days in Alaska, and also a teen Riker entering the academy. That would have made some good flashbacks that would have helped develop a backstory of Riker but that never happened.",3

Why do you think ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" is still on the air? Given that now we have Tosh.0 and the oh-so-different Ridiculousness to boot, it's a safe bet that clips shows are what we're all about. And that's why ""Shades of Gray"" is a fine episode. It takes all of the crap from 2 seasons worth of TNG and distills it into an easily digestible form. All told, it saves you a good 20 hours of some pretty awkward television. If you watch ""Measure of a Man,"" ""Q Who,"" ""Samaritan Snare,"" and ""Shades of Gray,"" then you'll know as much about the first 2 seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation as any other casual fan, and you'll be happier for not seeing the Anti-Drug PSA episode of ""Symbiosis,"" as well.",10
20,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Shades of Gray (TV Episode 1989)","Contrary to poopular opinion of this ep, I think it is one of the best TNG eps ever.","After suffering through ""Encounter and Farpuke"" and ""The Naked Data and Tasha Now"" during the first season of ST:TNG, which I considered embarrassments to Trek, I wholly set aside watching Star Trek: The Next Generation, for the entire first two seasons.It was not until I saw THIS ep First Run, that I changed my mind about the series.First off, Riker steps into a lethal TRAP on an alien planet - A Plant which injects him with a molecular POISON that feeds off of Riker's positive endorphins. The more Riker thinks of Pleasant things (usually involving his relation-whips with Troi and other various females of the first 2 seasons), the more the poison kills him. Dr Pulaski, who was my favourite Trek Doctor Ever, a female version of McCoy, acerbic as McCoy was and just as good a doctor - Is faced with a new Medical Conundrum, her last during her Tenure as Medical Officer of the Enterprise-D. And between Her and Troi, they figure out how to beat the poison. But to do that, we must see what Riker is remembering. And what better way to do that than to have Flashbacks of the best scenes from the 1st two seasons? And so, to give us an idea of what Riker is going through mentally, they give us Riker-Centric scenes from the 1st and 2nd seasons that show Riker dealing with various women, emergencies and command decisions.I did not know why, at the time, they were doing a ""Flash-Back Episode"" of TNG. I know now, it was because of a Writers Strike. Despite that, Season Two DID Produce some good episodes, ""Contagion"", ""Q-Who"" and my favourites ""Elementary Dear Data"" and Favourite of all ""A Matter of Honour"".Maurice Hurley wrote the Bare-Bones story of Riker becoming Infected, and the proper flashbacks were taken from 1st and 2nd season Episodes. These were flawlessly edited to make a show, that caused me to see WHAT I had been missing. It was this Episode and it's Flashback scenes, that showed me the Aliens of ""Conspiracy"", the explosions of ""Heart of Glory"", and the various Women from ""Angel 1"" and such seducing Riker, that piqued my Interest in the whole show. And so, as flawed as Trek fans consider this Episode, this Ep drew me INTO the show as one of it's biggest fans.Due to this shunned episode, I was able to sample some of the best Episodes and Scenes of the first 2 years of Trek TNG. And the following season, I was there watching EVERY First Run Ep.It was only two weeks ago, when I acquired the entire latest DVD release of the series, that I have been able to see these eps the way I ORIGINALLY saw them, over 20 years ago. And when I watched this ep, it brought back to me, the excitement I experienced when I realised I was MISSING the best TV show of the last 50 years.",
21,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Shades of Gray (TV Episode 1989)",Season Two,"The first season of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" was almost entirely focused on creating a different atmosphere from The Original Series, to the detriment of plots and character development. Season Two, however, starts to get on the right track by getting all the cast in their correct positions going forward and, even more specifically, realizing what a gem of a character they stumbled into with Data (Brent Spiner).In all honesty, there are still portions of this season that are wildly uneven (hence the 3-star rating). Some episodes are quite ham-fisted yet, and a few are just downright boring/stupid. ""Shades of Grey"" may be the worst season finale in the history of, well, season finales. How much of this was the show runners' faults and how much was network interference can be debated, but the result is quite uneven.That being said, there are enough things that go right to give the show reasons for excitement going forward, including...-Geordi La Forge (Levar Burton) and Worf (Michael Dorn) at their respective posts (engineering, security), not like the first season where the writers weren't sure what to do with them. Settling into a groove allows the characters to grow.
-Showing the human side of William Riker (Jonathan Frakes), whose posturing and brashness in Season One bordered on ridiculous and over-the-top. River is a great character on the show (as he is really the only throwback to a Kirk-like authority figure), but only if his ego can be humanized from time to time, which happens in Season Two.
-A solid focus on Data and understanding exactly what they want to do with the android character. Episodes like ""Elementary, Dear Data"" (playing Sherlock Holmes in the Holodeck), ""The Outrageous Okona"" (Data tries to understand comedy), and ""Measure of A Man"" (Data's sentience is put on trial) show that the writers are finally understanding that Data may just be the most interesting character on the entire show as he struggles to understand the concept of ""humanity"" on a starship where that concept is so refined.Perhaps the shining moment of the entire season, however, is the introduction of the Borg, easily the most formidable opponent ever faced by the Enterprise, courtesy of Q's (John De Lancie) doings. The Borg only appear in one episode, but that single hour single-handedly shows that ""The Next Generation"" may just have a bright future if the storytelling consistently improve. Watching Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) fully comprehend the implications of the Borg is a dramatic treat.So, while still a bit too uneven to give really high marks, Season Two of ""The Next Generation"" shows that this show really does have the potential for greatness (something the first season never quite convinced me of). There is still a ways to go, but as a viewer I am more motivated to stick around and find out what's in store for the future.",6
22,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Shades of Gray (TV Episode 1989)",about my eyes..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 02With new smart ideas, compelling dramatic pieces and ethical dilemmas that makes you think twice, the second round of this enterprise crew is surely an improvement where more diversity and maturity is visible.Shades Of GrayThe episode literally flashes back and reminisces about the past, with none whatsoever agenda except for a big one that is stuck in our throat throughout the episode as it grows harder and harder to swallow.",
23,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Shades of Gray (TV Episode 1989)",I'm being too generous...,"I gave this episode a 5, since I chuckled out loud at Data & Geordi's interaction with the planet's fauna.

24,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Shades of Gray (TV Episode 1989)","A NOT terrible study in minimalism, human emotions, and empathy.","This isn't as bad as most people make it out to be, and it certainly doesn't deserve being ""the worst"" episode of TNG. The a-plot (the only one) is mildly interesting (although admittedly not really that original), and the rest of the episode is filled out with clips from earlier episodes interspersed with scenes set in sickbay as Dr. Polanski and Troi try to save Commander Riker. Towards the end some of the clips are a bit gory for those like me who are not into gore, but if you've watched all the earlier episodes there are no punches here, which is nice. The concept of positive, sex, and survival (primal) emotions making infection worse while negative emotions involving others (empathetic) ones destroy it is deep. Overall not a bad analysis of various emotions utilizing Riker (a good choice) in the first two seasons shot on a minimum budget and in only three days. The first ten minutes or so do demonstrate the minimal effort involved as some of the scenes obviously cut corners with footage, so as a season closer, not that great. Simply as an episode I'd give it a B- or C+.",7
0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Encounter at Farpoint (TV Episode 1987)","A half-good, half-bad beginning to a good sci-fi series","Star Trek: The Next Generation's pilot episode is a mixed bag. On the one hand, there's a decent cast and everything LOOKS better than the original series -- the spacecrafts, F/X, costumes and sets -- but, on the other, half of the story is goofy and awkwardly implemented into the main story.The ""goofy"" part is the character of Q, an omniscient being, who suddenly appears on the Bridge of the Enterprise and then instantaneously transports most of the Bridge crew to some absurd trial with a bunch of barbarians as the audience. This part of the story was written by Gene Roddenberry and he was pressured to add it to D.C. Fontana's script to make ""Encounter at Farpoint"" a double episode.The problem with the Q subplot is that it's premature. The purpose of a pilot episode is to establish the characters and the basic tone of the series. Fontana's story about the cast grouping together and their experiences at the Farpoint station accomplish this, but Roddenberry's Q story seems tacked-on, outlandish and premature.Sure, the character of Q was based on Trelane from the original series episode ""The Squire of Gothos,"" but (1.) that episode wasn't introduced until the second half of the first season when the serious tone of the series was well established, and (2.) Trelane was presented in a believable way despite his goofy antics. It's called good writing.In ""Encounter at Farpoint,"" by contrast, it's not 8 minutes into the story -- the very first episode of the series -- and this goofball character suddenly appears on the Bridge and proceeds to instantaneously kidnap the Bridge crew and take them to some bizarre trial in the midst of a bunch of uncouth barbarians. This entire sequence takes place in the first half hour and it just mars the seriousness and credible-ness of the rest of the episode.Thankfully, everything else is like the original series, just better, at least as far as appearances go. The writing wouldn't catch up till the third and fourth seasons, although there are some gems here & there in the first two.",5
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Encounter at Farpoint (TV Episode 1987)","C+: Good, but not great.","'Encounter At Farpoint' is the double-length pilot episode of The Next Generation and introduces us to the characters, the ship and... the writers, who at this point were the weakest link.The two main plots are engaging enough. Going on commentary from Roddenberry, the Q entity was written in later at Paramount's behest but, to me, is the most amusing part of this outing. Q almost represents the studio's viewpoint - in the show, the whole human race is on trial, in reality, the entire TNG concept was on trial. His presence is a definite highlight and he would go on to be one of the most memorable characters of any Star Trek incarnation. Q's presence interweaves comfortably with 'the trial' itself which is the unravelling an enigma: how did an obviously technologically deficient race build a frontier outpost of high-technology to service the Federation, and can the mystery be solved without resorting to violent methods thereby proving Q correct in his definition of the human race as barbaric and child-like?From a technical standpoint this episode is respectable. For particular commendation I would single out Industrial Light and Magic's excellent special effects work. The models of the Enterprise-D and the alien spacecraft(s) set a high watermark which remains, for me, an engrossing aspect of the show to this day. We now take complex and expensive shots like these for granted in television shows, but until TNG it wasn't all that common.As for the performances, the cast are still tentative within their new roles, finding their comfort zones and strengths. Some of the dialogue allows them chances to connect with their characters and therefore with the audience, other sections would be better delivered tongue-in-cheek rather than with deadly earnestness, or omitted entirely. My own assumption is that at this point Roddenberry was working towards the strengths of the old cast, whom he was familiar with, expecting them to be partial clones of Kirk and crew instead of relying on his new actors to take Star Trek in interesting new directions. When he stepped down as Executive Producer and handed more responsibility to Braga (who, sadly, would go on to lose his deft touch while in control of Voyager) many of the problems were ironed out.'Encounter At Farpoint: Parts I and II' represent some of the best moments of the first season but not necessarily the entire Next Generation run or the four films that would follow. It is abundantly obvious that the premise has great promise, but it would not be until late into the second season that consistency would improve and truly great stories would be added to the Star Trek canon.",7

4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Encounter at Farpoint (TV Episode 1987)",Does Hubris in 'Encounter at Farpoint' Indicate the Tenuous Survival Value of Humans?,"""Encounter at Farpoint"" (Episode 1, Season 1, Air Date 09/28/87, Star-date 41153.7) restarted Roddenberry's Star Trek years after 'Star Trek: The Original Series', beginning a new search across the universe much in the tradition of the original. It set a thoughtful, imaginative, and visionary tone for the entire 7 season series.The most interesting feature of this two-part episode consists of little gems below the surface of the show, not the overall plot. But I thought some character actions contradicted its main questions and tests (more on this below): Is humanity civilized? Are we 'savage lifeforms' or a 'dangerous child race'? Can we ever advance to the point where we are not dominated by war, drugs, and immorality? Patrick Stewart plays Captain Picard and enters the series in a dramatic emergency. A God-like alien called Q confronts Picard and his crew with the record of 'savage' wars in our past. Q puts Picard and humanity on trial to decide whether we should be allowed to exist or be exterminated. And then the rest of the episode puts Picard to the test against the mystery of a new Farpoint station and an interesting space-dwelling organism.However, my question as I re-watched this episode was whether the show violates its own test of humanity. Picard challenges Q to test him and his crew as an example of humanity's current state of sophistication. Picard seems apt to pass the test of civilization's moral worth; he intelligently investigates Farpoint to solve the mystery, he is not prone to cause destruction with evil intentions, and his crew responds automatically to emergencies and the needs of the injured.But does his crew (both human and Klingon) sometime act like irresponsible imbeciles? The answer is a huge yes. Possibly it is done consciously and by intention. Several crew members act without thinking: Tasha wants to fight Q (which would be lethal since he is an almost all powerful being) and Worf thinks about blasting an image of Q on the front viewer of the ship. Obviously humans (and Klingons) need additional growth to shed their war-like tendencies.In addition, the crew is typically compelled to act like dare devils; Picard ignores probabilities at times and pushes the ship to speeds well past safety limits. He even tries a new maneuver to separate the ship's saucer section when he never ever tested the procedure at such high speeds. My question was: How will this crew survive Q's test at this rate? And will it instead prove that our emotional prejudices against reason and probabilities will be our demise?Here are some highlights I enjoyed:(1) Data announces his desire to be more human-like. This makes me ask: Should Data learn to whistle and become more human, or should he ignore silly human qualities and take pride in his own characteristics? Since he strives to be more human than he is, he sets out on a goal to participate in the Form of Humanity (as Plato might say) as closely as he can; he is like one of Plato's imperfect instances or shadows of a Form, always trying to attain a more perfect human Form or identity (Plato's 'Republic' or 'Phaedo').(2) Data points out that humans tend to be prejudiced against machines, which makes Riker wonder whether Data thinks he is superior than humans. Data says he is in many ways (in a matter of fact way). Of course, Riker probably knows that by simply pointing to a prejudice, Data doesn't imply any thoughts of superiority.Cool technology: (3) Introduction of the Holodeck. (4) The ship computer can locate any crew member anywhere (a little frightening for privacy). (5) The ship has a low gravity gym. (6) Dr. Crusher uses a paperless and thin, hand held, computerized screen to do her work.(7) Admiral McCoy inspects the ship and converses with Data, who he compares to a Vulcan and calls 'boy' a lot for some reason.(8) Wesley Crusher gets to visit the bridge and show off his knowledge of ship equipment. Picard feels uncomfortable around kids, but even he can't avoid sharing in the wonder of a child examining the bridge for the first time.(9) The alien space-dwelling organisms in the episode are able to transfer energy into matter at will (in a more advanced way than ship transporters). They can safely live in space, reminiscent of the space child born at the end of Kubrick's '2001 - A Space Odyssey'.(10) Q says he might be back and he will be. Q was never my favorite invention in the series, but a few interesting ideas become possible through such a powerful being.Gene Roddenberry reimagined the show with a larger crew and cast than the original series; the captain is older, many children live on ship with their parents, the ship lighting looks more like a Kubrick film (compare it to '2001: A Space Odyssey' or even 'The Shining'), a mysterious android joins the crew, and many characters have special abilities.But as Stephen Hawking points out, Star Trek doesn't generally imagine humans as much more biologically or personally advanced than us (see Ch. 6 on Star Trek in Hawking's 'The Universe in a Nutshell'), except for those few special cases listed below.LeVar Burton as Geordi has enhanced vision, Marina Sirtis as Deanna has extra sensory powers for the emotions of other lifeforms (through her half-Betazoid/half-human empathy), Brent Spiner as Data has immense physical strength and far superior mental processing, and later we find that Wil Wheaton (as Wesley Crusher) has potential to become a time traveler and the 'Mozart' of understanding technology.I think the episode highlights the struggle to overcome our flaws, and perhaps it highlights just how much SF depends on hubris and a lucky turn of events to save us! Can humanity dare to hope for such luck too?",
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Encounter at Farpoint (TV Episode 1987)",Off to a Good Start,"As this series progressed and we got to know and love these characters, we must harken back to the inception of the series. It's an awful lot to throw out there. Multiple characters, most of whom continue in their roles for all or most of the series. The introduction of Picard, who is a real contrast to the James T. Kirk flamboyance. There is adventure and control. We are shown the ship and get to know how she came to be. Q enters at the start and will be a factor in the future. I've always struggled with this being because when a nearly omnipotent creature show his face, it diminishes the powers of the poor crew whose efforts seem somehow futile. It's good that he bows out, for the most part, as the series continues. The expense and effort of this experiment asked us to accept a new, modern version of the somewhat tacky, though highly entertaining, original. Commander Data takes on the Spock role, but as an android brings a different kind of detachment. His programming has a couple of interesting subsystems. The first plot test Picard and the crew to become more global (universal?) in investigating a force in the universe that doesn't play by their rules. How they approach this and deal with this while being tested by Q works very well for the most part. When I first saw this, I was so pumped. Just the thought of intelligent science fiction on prime time television made me long for its success.",8
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Encounter at Farpoint (TV Episode 1987)",A so-so start for a terrific series.,"** out of ****Star Trek: TNG was one of my favorite TV shows growing up.  Space adventures always appealed to me, but it was the cast and the concepts the show explored that often won me over.  After having seen the pilot episode, a two-parter entitled Encounter at Farpoint, I see many of the qualities I enjoyed about the series, but this is a fairly subpar episode that's only occasionally compelling.Set some 80 years after the original Star Trek (thus placing it, if I'm not mistaken, in the 24th century), the new crew of the starship Enterprise is headed by Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart).  The crew's assignment: to investigate Farpoint station, but before they can reach their destination they're intercepted by a god-like entity who calls ""himself"" Q (John De Lancey).  Q has deemed the human race savage beasts and puts the Enterprise crew on trial.  Their test is Farpoint and if they fail to uncover the dark secret of the station, then well...they'll assumingly receive a dreadful fate.  The first part of Encounter at Farpoint is pretty good, the characters are nicely introduced and mostly well-played by the cast.  Patrick Stewart immediately stands out as the stern but well-meaning Picard.  Brent Spiner is fantastic as Data, and Jonathan Frakes makes a likeable first officer as Commander Riker.  Noticeably different from the original Star Trek is a larger female cast.  Marina Sirtis, Gates McFadden, and Denise Crosby are all fairly attractive (Sirtis would later be a full-blown hottie by season two, and McFadden is actually the best-looking of all the Star Trek ladies right now, talk about aging gracefully; sorry, Jeri Ryan and Jolene Blalock just don't do it for me).Unfortunately, the plot, while initially intriguing, ultimately doesn't really go anywhere and there's the certain feeling that fitting the whole story into two parts is really stretching it out.  A lot of the material, obviously played for introductory purposes, could still have been cut out. In fact, all the stuff focusing on the mystery behind Farpoint barely adds up to a half-hour, excluding the really lengthy climax, which is just plain boring.  When the secret of Farpoint is revealed (which you'll probably figure out before the cast does), all the conjecture and facts are messily spouted in one of those silly coversations where each character continues the sentence after the previous speaker has finished. 
But Encounter at Farpoint works adequately enough as an intro to one of the best sci-fi television series, right up there with Stargate: SG-1 and the first two seasons of Sliders.  Watch for Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Q's bailiff.",

Picard, of course, doesn't comply with this decree and soon finds that Q IS pretty much all-powerful. Eventually, Q places Picard and the crew on trial--a trial that MIGHT result in their obliteration. The trial is a total farce and it's interrupted when Picard suggests that Q examine the PRESENT human race to see if it still savage--at which point Q releases everyone for them to continue their original mission to Farpoint. Could it be what they do at Farpoint determines what Q will do next?After re-watching the show, I realize that I was a bit harsh-- though it is not a particularly outstanding episode either. While I really grew to love the Q episodes, this one is VERY preachy about how noble the human race has become--one of the more annoying aspects of the Star Trek future. Additionally, the show is a bit slow compared to later shows--but I cannot blame everyone, as the show was trying to find its way and establish itself. Worth seeing but not particularly noteworthy aside from being the first two episodes.",6
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Encounter at Farpoint (TV Episode 1987)",Revisiting Encounter at Farpoint,"I am giving this a 10, not for this episode in itself, but for what the series eventually became.In fact, many mistakes were made in this episode. Paramount had insisted to Gene that this be a two-hour pilot. Initially, it was to be just about the ""Starbase"" built on ""Farpoint"" and the deception of the alien race who built it. But the added hour caused Gene to add the ""B"" Story (Or, ""A"" Story, I've never figured out which story was the main story here) about the being named ""Q"" putting Picard on Trial for the ""Crimes of Humanity"".This was not needed, the original ""alien"" story could have been expanded to be made interesting. But despite this, this episode provided the formula for rest of the series, each episode having an ""A"" and B"" storyline- Compressed into a 45-minute format, this works. But as a 2- Hour pilot, it was hard to watch.It was as if all of the new gadgets of Trek had to be all exploited in this pilot. We know from the books written about Trek and The Making of it, that even the original Enterprise had a Holodeck and the Saucer Section could separate from the Drive Section. Had The Original Series gone on to more seasons, we would have seen these things- They just never came up in the 80 episodes of TOS (Including the great Original Pilot with Jeffrey Hunter).I just thought it was rather dumb to separate the Saucer Section immediately - In all of the rest of the series, this had happened only three additional times: In ""Arsenal of Freedom"" where Geordi fights the Leggs-Container-in-space, when Riker fought the Borg, and then the Drive Section blew up in ""Generations"". However: We had to get Riker over to Farpoint while the Q thing was happening, and this was the only way to do it.My first impressions of Data, Worf, Troi, Tasha, and especially Dr. Crusher were particularly bad. And to have BONES show up for a Cameo, was almost senseless. But I did enjoy seeing DeForest talking to Data and looking at his Ears. I just thought these new crew characters were weak.Not to mention, we had Data, Worf, Geordi, and Riker all as the Primary Bridge Crew. Too Many Bodies, too many Lieutenants- too many things to keep track of and to go wrong.But the BEAUTY of this pilot, everything looked very good. The Special Effects were Feature Film Quality, and I thought, ""If they can do this on practically a weekly basis, I'll keep watching"".Watching the extra features on the 2003 DVD set, Gene himself knew of these shortcomings, and they were addressed immediately. Geordi slowly graduated to Engineering, Worf logically took over Security.I Could never finger down why I never liked Dr Crusher and Tasha Yar. Neither of them acted like what they were representing. I could tell they were great actresses, but often I would go ""What...?"" - Tasha just wasn't Tough enough it seemed. And Crusher never really made us believe she was a Doctor - Not until she came back in the 3rd Season after Dr. Polaski's female version of Bones left. And when Tasha came back for ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" she was much more believable in the role.Changes in Writing Staff and Production Crew had to be established before any of these changes could occur, it is not that the original Writers, some of them David Gerrold and DC Fontana from TOS - These are fantastic writers - But something different had to be done, and it was not until they hired Ronald D Moore and the Beimler-Manning production team, things started clicking.But in this pilot, things drift too much. Troi is wearing what looks like a modified TOS Miniskirt, but they immediately stuck a bun on her head and gave her the suit her shapely figure was poured into for season 1. As a matter of fact, we saw many of these Miniskirted Crewmen - Some Men! Wandering Around the ship! I noticed that they were given regular crew uniforms almost immediately.I am giving all the reasons why I should hate this, but I could tell even when I watched this for the first time, this could be great. And it did become great. And ""Q"" just had to come back, he was a great pivoting point from which to kick the stories into a whole new direction.This Pilot actually became the Blueprint from which Paramount made three other shows: Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise- But Enterprise drifted away from Canon- FAR from Canon. It was a look back when in fact most of the Trek Fans wanted more of the Future Following the ends of DS9 and Voyager. But we had Three SHows which lasted the full seven years, and they all came from this original Pilot, which was the basis on which everything looked: If you watch Deep Space Nine and Voyager, regardless of what you think of those shows - You can tell you are in the same Universe as The Next Generation.",10
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Encounter at Farpoint (TV Episode 1987)",A Solid but Uneven Start,"Encounter at Farpoint had the chore of setting up the characters and settings of the first Trek series since the original. It also introduces Q, who is surrounded by an interesting but thin premise about proving if mankind has changed much throughout history.I decided recently to go back and watch The Next Generation from the start. Since I have a new baby and a lot of time spent watching or holding her, I had the time. I sometimes cringe at the first season, as some of the costumes were horrible, the acting and characterizations were a little off and the special effects weren't as sharp as they could have been. That said, I was surprised how much this episode and many of the first season offerings did hold up.Encounter at Farpoint is an entertaining start for Trek but it wasn't completely successful. Q was a great character, it was fun seeing McCoy and a lot of the other characters were well introduced. Troi was horrible and I am glad they eventually got rid of her over emotional empathy. Worf was just a token Klingon who thankfully, became one of the most complex characters through Deep Space Nine. And Yar was one of the most unfocused characters ever created for Trek, this side of Harry Kim from Voyager. The story, while classic Trek, took a backseat to the look and new characters.This is a good start to the series. Several stinkers were to follow and the uneven second season helped The Next Generation finds its wings though it's run.",6
10,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Encounter at Farpoint (TV Episode 1987)",The Next Generation of fans...,"I remember watching Encounter at Farpoint with my kids for the first time. My middle daughter was taking a Sci-Fi Philosophy class in school (lucky kid!) and they showed this episode on a day when she stayed home sick, so she wanted to catch up with the class. Naturally, I was only too happy to help her with her homework.I had watched a lot of TNG episodes with my daughters over the years, but I avoided the pilot because I remember it being a little cheesy. Upon rewatching, it was better than I remembered. They did a good job of introducing the new Trekosphere.There was a ""bit of the old, bit of the new"" feeling to the pilot. On the ""old"" side, we had the ladies wearing mini-dress uniforms, a cameo by McCoy, an all-powerful being behaving badly, and a plot that was very much in the ""seek out strange new life"" vein. On the new side, there was the holodeck (fun!), children on board (what?), a Klingon on the bridge (gasp!), an Enterprise that could separate the saucer (squee!), and a Captain that was very much Not Kirk. (In the future, we will have evolved beyond the need for toupees...)I told my kids that when TNG first aired in 1987, loyal fans of the original series had been waiting 18 long years for another ongoing Trek series, and the anticipation was huge. I still remember the closing scene where Picard leans forward in the captain's chair and exclaims ""Let's see what's out there..."" I got a charge out of that line Back In The Day, and I got a charge out of it again.It was fun to boldly go again, and especially fun to watch it with The Next Generation of fans in my family.",7

It introduces us to the crew of the Enterprise-D commanded under Captain Jean-Luc Picard (played by the great Patrick Stewart) as a captain so far removed from the likes of Captain Kirk, we get to see another type of captain in action. We are also delighted to see John de Lancie as one of Star Trek's best villains - Q in his first of many appearances (""temper temper, mon capitan""!). And lookout for a guest star appearance by a ""Southern Doctor""!",7
12,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Encounter at Farpoint (TV Episode 1987)",A Touch of Doctor Who,"I think the pilots of most beloved shows tend to look silly or awkward when viewed in retrospect, and this is no exception. As the actors grow into their roles, the characters develop, and viewers become accustomed to the finished product. This pilot had to convince a lot of fans of TOS that it was going to be worth their time, as well as win over new viewers, and I think it accomplished that, rough edges and all.I missed the first three episodes when they originally aired, and only recently watched this one for the first time. I did notice that the Farpoint plot itself was very similar to ""Doctor Who - The Creature from the Pit"".",
13,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Encounter at Farpoint (TV Episode 1987)",Good start,"I was in real fear when I heard that a new Enterprise and crew had been created. I loved the original cast so much I was under the deluded impression that they could not be replaced. As this show continued I realized that this was a brilliant progression and not a replacement. Patrick Stewart's Jean Luc Picard brought us a brand new Captain. It would have been real boring if he had been anyways like Kirk. The rest of the crew were all interesting too, all with carefully researched backgrounds and these would present many an interesting story throughout the series illustrious 7 year run. Early into the ship's first mission the crew encounter Q, an omnipotent being who puts the crew on trial. Interestingly similar to war crimes of Neuremberg in a strange kind of way. They are given a test and proceed. All crew are gradually introduced and they are all uniquely different. When Commander Riker asks for the android Commander Data, we see him escorting a very special Admiral to the shuttle bay. None other than Admiral McCoy from Starfleet in one of Star Trek's most beautiful scenes ever. The test which Q set is eventually passed and the Enterprise warps off for a fantastic 7 year run of adventures",9
14,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Encounter at Farpoint (TV Episode 1987)",The worst of all Star Trek pilots,"First of all, I love Star Trek and especially ""The next Generation"". But it seems that TNG is the only ST series that needed two full seasons to (really) get started. I mean, there are some all time classics in the first two (most prominently the introduction of the Borg, several Q appearances etc.) but honestly: there was a lot of anachronisms, too, that were clearly oriented on TOS-like concepts which a bit too often led to involuntary comedy (remember ""Justice""?).I don't want to try figuring out the reason but to mention a mere symptom of this hesitant start of a great SF series. I do believe, the pilot is an original problem of this series. To me it suffers from a really bad script (not only the story but the wooden dialog as well), which confronts the Enterprise with a totally absurd scenario which is created around a couple of scenes to introduce each crew member with one or two remarks on his background or abilities. I mean, does it really satisfy a such highly developed creature like a Q to provoke some humans? Is it possible to develop to such a high state by acting on prejudice? The human race on trial for its past sins? Star Trek always had a moral point (one of its definite strengths to me) but this seems to lead in almost theological spheres and the far too sentimental and naive way of dealing with it doesn't suffice a topic of this dimension.Roddenberry just wasn't willing of letting go of his model image of the Federation and Starfleet. Surely, mankind in Star Trek has advanced in many important aspects. But if you take a look at Captain Kirk, the Starfleet pioneer, he surely had a savage air to him (he was quite fond of the opposite sex and he definitely knew when to fight, even when that included breaking a whole bunch of Starfleet regulations). Otherwise his opposite Spock never would made have made any sense. So to make a long story short, the point that the human strength often lies in its most obvious weakness (the conflict between reason and emotion) was always a main theme in Star Trek and three seasons of TOS plus five feature films (we're in 1987) made that clear. So why again having to point out that we're dealing with a new (or farther developed) mankind? To gain a new, ST-inexperienced audience, I guess. But a new crew, a new ship and all the possibilities coming with that offer so much more than making a wallpaper out of Star Trek's omnipresent but always subtly woven into the plot leading concept...But among those many flaws, there are some highlights here. First of all Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) who delivers a quite remarkable performance (even if he has some silly lines and is only giving a glance at what is to come). John de Lancie's ""Q"" is the only one on the set, who can compete with him. Riker's quite sympathetic and Data is played OK but suffers a bit from his underdeveloped character (he refers to the way he feels, but he should not be capable of emotions besides a self diagnosis program). The rest of the cast do quite well, too, except of Troi, who's performance was way below the demanded level of her empathy scenes. All in all, only the sensitive viewer, who was able to penetrate the surface and take a look at the great potential which lay deeply hidden in the leads, was able to guess how this second ST series would eventually develop. This pilot doesn't seem the right solution to recommend a new TV-Series. Bad script, bad direction (there wasn't a single shot that really convinced me) and a sometimes ridiculous artwork (most prominently the costumes) almost blew it. I guess without its prestigious title, this clearly would have been dropped by paramount. To me this pilot is one of the reasons that lay base for the vicious circle that left Star Tek TNG's first two seasons with a quite low budget and almost no chance to improve beyond the scripts and the eagerness in the acting...",6
15,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Encounter at Farpoint (TV Episode 1987)",A Bit of a Rocky Start,"In the series premiere of ST:TNG ""Encounter at Farpoint"", Captain Picard and his new crew of the Enterprise are on a mission to go check out a new far off outpost controlled by the Bandi people. They seem to have developed this state-of-the-art base exceptionally fast. The plan is (if negotiations go well) bring them under Federation control. The ships's new First Officer and doctor are both already at Farpoint awaiting pickup. But something seems off about this new base, something strangely mystical.Meanwhile the Enterprise en route are being pursued and harassed by a powerful being named Q who charges the crew with the crimes of all if humanity, setting up a strange kangaroo court with many anachronisms. Q gives Picard 24 hours to prove that humanity has evolved and changed their past ways.A UFO shows up that turns out to be a living being. It attacks the old Bandi city in anger. The Enterprise crew learns that the Bandi's new ""base"" is actually a living creature that is severely malnourished and is being sucked dry by the plantet's people. Picard feeds the being energy so it can rise and depart the planet with its mate that has shown up. The two fly off together. Q gives humanity a pass for the kindness shown and the Enterprise takes off for its next adventure.It's unsurprising to me that one of the old guard wrote this episode because it's extremely reminiscent of a TOS episode. The court scenes, the plotline revolving around humanity's evolution beyond violence, the weird Shakespearean anachronisms. It definitely has the vibe of TOS, even more accentuated by McCoy's cameo.While the plot isn't all that original or interesting we do start to get a bit of a sense of these characters. In Season 1 (and a lot of Season 2), the crew aren't exactly fully realized. It takes this show a while to build up speed to cruise control. Data feels different than when you see him later on (as do a lot of the characters). But we do get some sense of things ahead.I like everyone's introductions. Everyone gets a scene or two to familiarize themselves to the audience (the benefit of a 2 hour premiere). It's nice to set some foundation moving forward.While this episode doesn't capture me as a Star Trek fan, it isn't so much of a disaster that it alienates me as an avid viewer. We'll call it par for the course.",5
16,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Encounter at Farpoint (TV Episode 1987)",The one that started it all...,"As an introduction to the various characters this is not so bad, and although delaying the arrivals of Riker, Dr. Crusher, and La Forge for over a half an hour was a good idea, the Q filler is far more horrific here than he would ever be again. The court scene is not just frightful, it is also excessively long and dates the show to its late-1980s release more so than many later episodes of TNG. Thankfully later episodes would improve the series, as would Troi's abilities. Although certainly not the worst (the dividing of the ship and its coming together again save the show, and the scene between the old admiral and Data is great), one can tell that the show is trying to figure out where it is going. Overall grade a C/C+.",6
17,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Encounter at Farpoint (TV Episode 1987)",Experimental beginnings,"There's an inescapable element of beta testing inherent in 'Encounter at Farpoint', and it offers no indication as to the lofty heights ""TNG"" will reach as a series. It's an audience tester, so it's natural to see the crew in different mismatched positions on the ship, and the tone hasn't been hammered out yet. All this is to be expected. But it's just . . . different. And that's the primary appeal to watching this again.Take Picard: terse, irritable, he's all man of action. I'm kinda surprised he never throws a Kirk-esque punch. Patrick Stewart's acting shines at various points, but looking at this, it's hard to see the refined diplomat that'll become his signature.None of this is is to say it's a bad pilot; it has great ILM effects, a varied crew, and more than anything, there's promise here. The sense that these people are genuine explorers.6/10",6
18,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Encounter at Farpoint (TV Episode 1987)",Star Trek: The Next Generation- Encounter at Farpoint,"Encounter at Farpoint was the opening episode for what would be the epic second Enterprise series with Captain Picard and crew encountering dangerous lifeforms and perilous situations which will demand heroism, courage, intellect, and fortitude. In the first episode, Picard and crew meet Q, a conniving powerful ""lifeform"" (the term lifeform seems too slight to use for a collective of being with such power) that can intrude upon anyone or thing, on any ship and usurp a type of authority because humans, in this particular case, are considered an inferior, savage race not worthy to exist because of history. First Q challenges Picard, Data, Deana Troi, and Lt Tasha Yar in a court circa 2085, full of medieval types who congregate for their trial and possible execution. Picard stands firm on the progress humankind has made, that the savagery they were once known for has ceased to exist, with peace and co-existence the goals for exploring the universe, Farpoint Station the first mission for the brand new Enterprise. Q and Picard wager whether or not humans are indeed savage and the Farpoint mission will be the ""case at trial"".It seems that Farpoint Station is not what it seems and that the planet with the Bandi race, who have an abundance of geothermal energy to spare, could be keeping a huge secret that will inevitably lead to Picard and crew having to deal with a large ""vessel"" which appears, strangely enough not hostile towards them, but the Bandi people. All the show pilot elements are in place. Picard and his ""#1"" commanding officer, Riker, meet for the first time. We see that Riker and Troi, a ""betazoid"" (a telepath who can sense emotions, partly human), were once an item. Yar is opinionated and wears her emotions on her sleeve when it comes to engaging a threat, with Picard having to bring her down to size. Data, an android made by a brilliant scientist, desires to be human, whistling ""life is but a dream"" meets Riker in a ""holographic program""(transporter beams can not only disassemble and reassemble our molecules so we can move from one place to another they can recreate worlds and events inside a defined program set to whatever the person chooses). Worf, a Klingon serving as a Federation officer, represents his race with certain principles he holds with authority, like honor and duty, shown unamused by Picard's decision to leave him on the saucer section of the Enterprise when he and certain members of the crew aboard the battle bridge, preparing to battle the Q forcefield. Picard makes Riker aware that he is uncomfortable around children. The ship's Chief Medical Officer, Beverly Crusher married a man who was Picard's best friend (widowed with a child, Wes, played by Wil Wheaton)and he addresses this as a concern she may wish to avoid through a transfer. And, this episode even includes DeForest Kelley as ""Admiral"" at the grand old age of 137, being taken, by Data of all people (who reminds Bones of Spock, in an inspired moment that nearly had me in tears), to another ship called the Hood. The central plot really isn't all that extraordinary, regarding Farpoint station, but this episode allows us to get a first glimpse of the crew and Q who would become a vital, recurring character. Oh, almost forgot, Geordi, blind Chief of Engineering, wears a type of device which allows him to see a great deal but causes a lot of pain. Each and every character, unlike the previous Classic Trek, would be given chances to evolve and shine. This is just the beginning of a wonderful run for a show that appeared at first to be three seasons at best.",7

22,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Encounter at Farpoint (TV Episode 1987)",every fact i am exposed to..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 01A promising start for the series, where cases may come and go, but the chemistry among the cast is what amps up the charge, with background still kept under the shades and just skimming off the surface of their equations, the makers have managed to tease us and hook us from the first adventure itself.Encounter At FarpointOff to a great start, with complex characters that doesn't go as anticipated along with a fresh perspective on an eerie case, that raises the spookiness bar and amps up the fans for a thrilling satisfying ride.",

In this episode, the crew becomes infected with a intoxicating element as it happened in the original series aboard Kirk's ship in the 1966 episode ""The Naked Time"". You get to see the characters, well, OUT of character (to see how a conservative Picard let's down his emotional defenses, i.e. expressing his love for Dr. Crusher - which will become a key focal character interaction as the series progresses). Oh and look out for the ""interaction"" between Data and Tasha - an event that Data will recount during his discussion 9 years later with the Borg Queen in Star Trek: First Contact!",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Naked Now (TV Episode 1987)","""The Naked Data and Tasha""","This was the first ""Official"" mission for the Enterprise-D.To tell you the truth, I cringed when I first saw this. I agree with some of the other reviews, that this is a poorly adapted ""rewrite"" of ""The Naked Time"" from TOS. Or so it seemed when I first saw it.Getting that out of the way, this episode does introduce a few interesting things. First off, that Data is ""Fully Functional"" and that when you prick him, he leaks.Season 1 and particularly this episode, was more of an exploration for the writers and actors - I like revisiting this to see the depth and scope of Trek and how it progressed. The 90's was the decade of Trek, as three major shows occupied our TV screens, two of them very successful as they were syndicated.This episode, as well as being a continuation of the same odd chemicals that affected Spock, Sulu and Chapel (And O'Reilly in Engineering) is also an exploration of various forms of intoxication, particularly alcohol inebriation.The Mechanism by which these molecules brought this drunken effect, not being explained in the original series episode, does not need to be explained here, other than it has to do with Gravitational effects. So, while the 1701-D crew fights off delirium, we also get to see a star explode and huge chunks of Solar Surface approach the Enterprise. Watching this in the recently remastered HD makes that experience much more enjoyable, the Stellar Explosion is perfect and the Cosmic Debris, highly detailed.And, revisiting this reveals that Wesley did not really ""Save"" the Enterprise, but he had an idea that contributed to their escape from impending vaporization.Any awkwardness with the characters can be explained as a Crew who did not know each other well, as well as actors who were defining their roles for the first time. And this Episode introduced the nice outfit that Troi wore for the rest of the season.If these early episodes had any drawbacks, they had to do with Gene Roddenberry trying to see how much of The Original Series they could safely implant here. Some of it did not work, some of it did. Eventually, he had to hire a whole new stable of Writers to bring us the 24th century rendition of Starfleet and the state of that Universe. The Klingons are allies. The Romulans are ??. The Ferengi are mentioned. At this point, we have an ideal universe, and ideal universes are not very exciting to write about. Eventually it came to be that Earth was ideal, but the universe outside was not, and starting with Season 1's ""Conspiracy"" episode, that starts getting explored.",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Naked Now (TV Episode 1987)",The continuing starting troubles of the new starship Enterprise...,"This episode was clearly intended to establish ""The next Generation"" by creating a link to its predecessor ""The Original Series"". To fans of the latter the scenario is quite well known and it might be fun to watch the new crew deal with the problem in their own way and exploring the new characters giving in to their hidden desires while infected.To me, this show will always be remembered as the one that started the enervating and ridiculous career of ""super brain"" Wesley Crusher-Roddenberry (for it was Gene Roddenberry's intention to create Wesley after some of his own childhood experiences and actually as someone for the show's younger audience to identify with). To me that character was one of Star Trek's darkest hours and every episode giving him a bigger part I just can't stand because he's able to ruin even some good scripts. Interestingly it's Patrick Stewart who obviously has some difficulty getting into his character here. I don't know if it is intended but all his scenes as the infected Captain are horrible because of his overacting of an overly stiff and inhibited Captain trying to be funny. But when you're really drunk, you don't have to act like you are you just behave differently and Stewart isn't able to deliver that. Riker greatly improved his performance to the pilot and the others do quite well also. The role of Troi, who was just awful in the beginning, was greatly reduced to some lines but even that reduced part seemed too much for Marina Sirtis, who isn't able to bring her character to life. Her lines just sound like read from the script without emotion (just like in a bad school play).All in all this second episode of The next Generation couldn't help to start off the season. Finally some remarks I wanted to add:Why is Riker sitting on a console while talking to Data on the bridge, ordering him to do research? Are those 24th century Computers multi role furniture as well? If you are sitting on your computer keyboard it certainly would't do it much goodWhen Geordi is confined to sickbay, why doesn't his leaving set off an alarm or is recognized by a nurse or other medical personnel(where are the nurses anyway? Well, I surely know that it's a budget problem).When LaForge visits Wesley in his quarters, why doesn't he recognize that his communicator is missing?When Data informs the captain of his research results, the computer graphic shows a model of the Constitution class-refit version of the first Enterprise. But the incident happened during their first five year mission (first season of TOS) before the refit.Where does this hissing sound come from when the ""disease"" is spread?When Wesley simulates Picard's voice and orders the chief engineer to the bridge, why doesn't she acknowledge the order. Had she done it there wouldn't have been any problem with leaving engineering unoccupied. Everyone who is ordered to report to somewhere acknowledges the order. That's Starfleet standard procedure and clearly visible in multiple episodesThe greatest flaw of all: Why is Data affected by a biochemical compound based on water and carbon. He is an android that means robotic and hasn't any organic parts (like the Borg for example)Last but not least, how does Weley regain reason when he has the idea to turn the tractor beam into a repulsor beam. That's surely a rather complex thing to do and he does it before he is ""cured"" by the hypo spray.All in all a typically Roddenberry TNG-script with a clearly stated anti-alcohol attitude, much too moralistic and clumsy (don't get me wrong, I usually like Star Trek's moral edge but Roddenberry's pointed finger I just can't stand). These are the continuing starting troubles of the new starship Enterprise...",6
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Naked Now (TV Episode 1987)",a brilliant intro,"When the crew of the Starship Enterprise find a ship adrift in space, they need to find out not only what killed the crew, but what appears to be affecting their own crew as well....This episode was actually the first one filmed, and it's certainly a rather intimate one to begin with! Probably why the cast became so tight knit over the 7 year run.There's humour abounding and several scenes now considered ""classic"". It was the first ever episode I watched of Star Trek (I never saw Original as a kid) and what an introduction! It led to a love of both the series and Data in particular. Definitely one not to miss!",
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Naked Now (TV Episode 1987)",D-: Awkward rewrite of a TOS episode.,"After a reasonably promising start our new Enterprise crew are thrust ever backwards into a clumsy rehashing of an old TOS episode that I wasn't too much of a fan of the first time around.This episode easily takes the cake for ""weakest episode of TNG"", and if it weren't for the equally poor Voyager effort ""Threshold"" might well be considered the worst story ever written for the franchise. It shows us some of the problems the early seasons had: Picard changing from sympathetic and controlled to barking orders at people, Riker still too much of a Kirk clone for his own good and Wesley being the cocky kid genius that is about as welcome as Scrappy was to Scooby-Doo.If you've seen the original episode ""The Naked Time"", you'll know what to expect. Crew finds virus, virus makes people giddy with joy and hijinx like they're drunk, virus spreads rapidly and is immune to old remedies. Embarrassing situations ensue.Cringeworthy humour can work given the right script and actors (see The Office UK and Peep Show) but for all the strengths of the team, it falls flat here, with a lot of things unintentionally hilarious and some others painful to watch.I think the scene with Data and Tasha sums it up; ""it never happened"".",4
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Naked Now (TV Episode 1987)",I want to kill Wesley Crusher!,"I have recently decided to go through all the TNG episodes in order. Of course we all know the first few seasons weren't great. I got through Encounter At Farpoint okay, even though it was not the best of the Star Trek pilots.This episode is your typical average opening season race against time to defeat an alien disease/infection before everyone on board dies! Specifically an homage to the original series', ""The Naked Time"" helps bridge the two series together.It starts off okay establishing the weekly plot format. Marina Sirtis instantly improved from her over-acting in the previous episode and we learn more about the new crew and how they and the Galaxy-Class starship function. However, the nature of the disease in this episode requires the cast to act as if drunk, which never really works convincingly in drama, and predictably the performances, not helped by the poor script, become embarrassing! The longer the episode goes on, the worse it gets.A major chunk of this episode is devoted to Wesley Crusher, who not only is a major part of the problem that the main characters have to get by in order to survive, but holds all the answers to their survival, thanks to Wesley's ""genius!"" I have no idea why Gene Roddenberry wanted to be represented by such a smug, snot-nosed, vomit-inducing, detestable character as Wesley Crusher! He is by far the most annoying and worst character in all of Trek, possibly in all of TV and Will Wheaton admits it! I know he's a kid, but at least Jake and Nog are likable and funny in DS9 and grow up to be quite respectable characters. I should not have to boo main characters we are ""supposed to"" like in any Star Trek.I thought ""Babel"" in DS9 was bad (a similar type of episode), but at least that had some good dialogue, character interaction and progression. The Naked Now is dire on almost every front! Data contracting the virus is another major fail, and btw, space-mom Bev Crusher suddenly comes up with a cure at the end! And yet the captain still insists on giving Wes some credit for his genius despite the ship being full of highly qualified Starfleet officers who should know better! Yuk! The end moralising reminds me of the old He-Man episodes I used to watch when I was six years old! If you're looking to watch random individual TNG episodes, avoid this one like the plague! If you're going through the series, this is one you will have to endure, and there'll be many more (especially the Wes-heavy episodes)! I can't wait for when TNG starts to get good at the end of the third season!",2

These guys were working well together and we are only on the second episode!! Patrick and Brent are brilliant in this when infected and are genuinely funny. The final solution to their impending jeopardy is a brilliantly conceived idea and gave Wesley a nod at such an early stage of the show. In a nutshell, a fun episode that escapes from all the usual tech babble and just has a little fun!",10
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Naked Now (TV Episode 1987)",What Is It Like to See a Sunset or to Exude Eagerness to Run a Starship?,"""Naked Now"" (Episode 2, Season 1, Air Date 10/05/87, Star-date 41209.2) sometimes gets a reputation as a guilty pleasure. But I found it filled with interesting and playful ideas that go beyond the couple scenes usually cited as representative examples (such as Data divulging that he is 'fully functional' in many sexual techniques, the tough security officer Tasha turning feminine, or Captain Picard and Dr. Crusher teasing about 'you will address me as...').The plot is not quite as important as the nuances and ambiance of the episode, as I'm finding is common in Star Trek. The Enterprise goes to investigate unknown problems on a starship, the U.S.S. Tsiolkovsky (which was studying a dying star). They find the remains of odd behavior and mass death on the Tsiolkovsky, but Geordi comes back from the away team with flu-like or intoxication-like symptoms. Riker and Data search for an explanation and find a previous situation involving a certain Captain James T. Kirk and his crew, who had also once started widely behaving as if they were intoxicated.Geordi takes off his communicator after he gets intoxicated (implying that communicators are important for locating people on the ship), flees from medical, and spreads the intoxication. As most of the crew of Enterprise experience the intoxication, chaos reigns supreme while Dr. Crusher searches for a new cure to the mysterious intoxication (the old cure doesn't work since the cause mutated from before) -- explained briefly as brought on by forceful strings of water molecules that were shifted by immense gravity.Though eagerness -- mixed with cleverness and perhaps genius -- is an immense enemy if its not on your side! Wesley Crusher gets 'drunk' with the chaotic molecules and smartly takes over the ship, the star outside is about to explode, and Wesley declares a new order that dessert must be served before and after every meal.But I found many little gems here and there in this episode that help give immortal life to the Star Trek world:(1) Data corrects Riker on a common mistake of saying 'sucked out' to space. No, many of the crew of the Tsiolkovsky look like they were 'blown out' to space. The more science they use, the less lofty they have to be!(2) Data fears his comment that he was 'already mentioned in several biomechanical texts' was misunderstood by Dr. Crusher as boastful. Perhaps she will look through the texts and find he was right and therefore not boasting.This makes me wonder about his quest to become more human. What form of human? Doesn't he know that boasting is very common to many humans! Perhaps he should forget his perfectionist tendency to never offend others and start acting more human. Or perhaps there are too many types of human for his quest to ever fully succeed.After he gets 'drunk', however, he argues that he is more similar to humans than different (he has chemical nutrients, fingerprints, sexual functioning, and bleeding-like leaks). So perhaps he doesn't need to go on a quest to be more human, or perhaps he is too 'drunk' to remember his desire to be more human.Though at one point Worf confides in Data that he also doesn't understand human humor, so perhaps Data is trying to become human beyond the understandable barriers of culture, species, life form.(3) Wesley succeeded in a science project to create a small tractor beam. He also shows Geordi another one of his creations, a small voice mimicker that puts together recordings of the Captain's voice into new sentences so that Wesley can play the Captain giving various fake orders. Wesley moans about not being able to visit the bridge even when he knows everything about it. We also find that Wesley can 'see circuits in his head' to help solve a critical problem in engineering. He exudes a love for technology and science.Wesley's eagerness comes fully alive after he gets intoxicated and turns his science project into a repulsor beam to take over engineering. He them plays the Captain's voice to the ship announcing Wesley the new Captain! Oh, the power of science when combined with the unbridled eagerness to run a ship!Wesley outsmarts the Captain in argument, making a good point that a Captain merely gives orders and that it's actually other people who implement the orders, so (says Wesley with wide eyes) just give Wesley the orders and allow him to run the ship!(4) Geordi is distraught over not having normal vision. He wants to see in 'shallow, dim, beautiful, human ways'. He argues that 'more sight isn't better sight'. He's 'never seen a rainbow or sunset' in the way humans do. We don't hear much more to get a full picture of exactly how much his sight is different. Perhaps he can see so many different wavelengths of light that he isn't able to narrow them into aesthetically pleasing forms.This reminds me of Thomas Nagel's essay ""What Is It Like to be a Bat"" ('A Historical Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind') in which he argues that it may be impossible to fully understand what it is like to experience things the way a species like a bat does (since it's so different from us).Geordi obviously doesn't experience things as differently as a bat but perhaps he is unable to know what it is like to see a sunset the way other humans can. In later episodes we are able to see how Geordi perceives the world through a visor video, but we are not able to make much of his video since we are not used to seeing the way he does.And they say this episode has nothing to offer! It has many little subtleties about Wesley's eagerness for science, Data's quest to be human, and Geordi's desire to experience things like other humans.",

However, annoyingly the episode focuses heavily on young Master Crusher, who begins here to make a habit of being a meddling little git. Oh, and Data and Tasha Yar have get it on. In fact, seeing the entire crew as a shambles this early on in the season is incredibly refreshing; all of the stoic seriousness of Starfleet which has only just been introduced is out of the window already.

Data and Tasha get it on, Wesley takes over the ship.Its funny how interested I was in watching the characters develop. They eventually developed them so well by the end of the series that watching first season episodes like this seems so embarrassingly stupid and primitive.I often wanted them to revisit planets/ideas from the original series on TNG- this is a good example of why it was a good idea that they didn't do that.But I liked it at first, even if I wince at it now.

My earliest memory of TNG was Data's high-speed repair of the isolinear chips in main engineering. ""What the hell is happening"" crossed my young mind - which is actually a great way to describe 'The Naked Now'. It is phenomenally puerile, especially since it's the first series episode. It makes you wonder how the show even made it past the first season at all. An away team brings back an infection that deadens inhibitions - which means the cast, one by one, goes full-on drunk. Wesely hijacks the ship (yeah), the engineering chief takes it apart, Data and Tasha bang, leaving Riker to step in as manly force of leadership - which I'm all for, just not in an episode that's, at best, inadvisable.Some clunky first steps, to say the least.4/10",4
11,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Naked Now (TV Episode 1987)",and joy.. and love..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 01A promising start for the series, where cases may come and go, but the chemistry among the cast is what amps up the charge, with background still kept under the shades and just skimming off the surface of their equations, the makers have managed to tease us and hook us from the first adventure itself.The Naked NowMost of the time is spent upon spreading the fear and weakness by the antagonist but still the stakes communicate with us for whom it preys and not how it preys, this loosely adapted episode from the original series is exactly what one expects from such remakes.",

It was only the second offering and I would imagine those who thought that the pilot was setting up an intellectual kind of science fiction was suddenly thrust into a kind of 1950's space commando movie. Wesley Crusher is a loose cannon whose character should have been eased into the series a little at a time. Let him earn his stripes. When one considers the expense and seriousness of these missions, for him to be playing around with such dangerous stuff seems awfully careless. He becomes a cause of trouble and then goes into the solution mode. The Enterprise is affected by a viral condition that causes irrational behavior. One would think that there would be some sort of fail-safe in operation. The fact that the crew is still around for the third episode is a credit to incredible chance and luck.

16,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Naked Now (TV Episode 1987)",A Retread of TOS Already?,"In ""The Naked Now"", on the way to meet up with a ship studying a collapsing star, the Enterprise finds that the ship has all of its crew dead or sucked into space through an open hatch. Something seems to have infected them and this is confirmed when Geordi starts acting strangely, lamenting over his lack of eyesight and being very quick to anger. The disease soon spreads, getting the best of many if the crew. Data and Riker find evidence of this disease in the past (from an old TOS episode) but the cure from that episode doesn't work since the disease has morphed and changed.The crew of the Enterprise reacts to the disease a tad bit different this time around. Basically, everyone but Wes and Geordi are horny. Data and Yar end up sleeping together (apparently Data can contract this disease as well?). Picard and Crusher do some terrible flirt-acting. Riker and Troi continue their ""will they, won't they"" introduced in the pilot. Wes locks himself in the engine room and declares himself in charge of the Enterprise. With the star collapsing soon, the Enterprise and its crew must find a cure so they can get back to normal and escape the star's destructive path or risk being destroyed.So obviously this is a reference to one of the earlier episodes of TOS. And that episode was a good one. They used everyone's lack of inhibitions to show us the personalities of the Enterprise crew. Kirk showed us his passion for his ship and how he's forgone a family or love life for his career. Spock deals with the constant struggle he has with suppressing emotion. All of it combines to give us a better idea of how these characters work...But here, there's not much character development to find. Just a bunch of riled up horndogs trying their best to maintain order on the bridge. Besides Geordi's self-reflection, there's not a lot to take away from this. I guess we learn about Data's anatomy?As a follow-up to the pilot, it's a real rocky start and it doesn't get any better in Episode 3. It's interesting in the sense that TOS could never have done this plot back in the 60's as it would have been far too racy. It's almost too racy for the 80's. But regardless of when this was released, time has not done it any favors. This is just a bad episode.",3

The timing, the scheduling of this episode makes no sense whatsoever. I'll try to keep to my usual format:Plot (SPOILERS!)The Enterprise finds a missing ship but the clearly unwell crew manages to kill themselves before an away party can help. When visiting the doomed ship, the team gets infected by a virus, and then bring it back aboard the Enterprise. Crew member after crew member succumbs to this virus, causing them to act drunk and disorderly, and slightly sexual. Events get out of hand with a planetary fragment on a collision course, a sick and drunk Wesley in control of the ship and even Data affected. Luckily Dr. Bev finds a cure, everybody is saved, and Wesley and Data get them out of the fragment's path.Good Stuff....................well........... I guess the episode has a good premise...? The frozen ghost ship is appropriately eerie. Patrick Stewart is always a joy... That's all.Things I despisedIt's not bad writing but bad timing. How can you have an episode with the main characters acting completely out of character, before we even get to really now them? For all we know things are always this loose and intoxicated. They use a sound effect whenever someone gets the virus because otherwise we might not catch on. This is an episode that, like the much, much better Genesis, would benefit by being paced in a later season. You can not let your cast act different than normal when the ""than normal"" part consists of only one previous episode. This crew is somewhat dull and awkward and the virus doesn't help. The despicable Tasha Yar hip-shakes her way to Troi's quarters in a scene that is unnecessary. Then she seduces Data. It might sound fun but it isn't, because at this point the viewer barely knew either of them. Data shouldn't be affected; he tell's Picard that he too is a being of flesh and blood even though that's exactly what he's not! Him falling on the bridge is supposed to be funny but it's illogical and cringe worthy.Gates McFadden and Whil Wheaton couldn't act if their lives depended on it and having them get so much screen time exposes their limited ability. Dr Crusher flirting basically consists of seeming out of breath and moving her eyes. Wesley gets the worst and most pedantic lesson about intoxication since sliced bread was invented.Honestly, if a drunk teenager with fake voice app can commandeer the Enterprise this is the easiest to hijack ship known to mankind. Your telling me there isn't a code Picard and Riker could use in unison to regain control in case of a hostile (no matter how inadvertently) take-over? And what's with the barely intelligible and seemingly mental ill engineer who helps Wesley. So this virus makes Yar a total nympho and it makes him disabled? How does this thing operate?ConclusionI like TOS and they could have pulled this episode off. If I'm not mistaken the script was intended for TOS. TNG might have pulled this off in, say, season 3 or 4, but certainly not season 1, and certainly not the very first real episode (the first being the pilot). It's cringe worthy, you can guess the middle and final part before main titles, Wesley isn't in trouble, we get another Picard- Dr Bev moment that will never be truly utilized, it ends sickly sweet, giving us a hint at how TNG will wrap up most episodes. But above all, because the actors simply didn't get the chance to become comfortable with their characters BEFORE making them act out of control, everything feels fake and the usual Stewart/Spiner acting talent cannot save this thing. You end up rooting for the planetary fragment to abort this show before it gets worse (which is exactly what happens next episode). 3/10 because it's not the worst and I don't absolutely hate it.",3

I always re-watch any title I'm going to review because that seems only fair, and it's usually a fun time, but this was just unbearable.Plot (SPOILERS)Desperately needing a vaccine the Enterprise travels to the only world (in the vicinity) that has it and is confronted by the leader of the planet, who is love struck by Yar, kidnaps her, and then allows his first wife to battle her to the death in order to see who truly is the first wife. Picard allows this to happen because of the prime Directive and because he likes Yar's chances. Tar is victorious, her opponent saved by the crew, and the leader of the world gets relegated to the status of second husband.Good Stuff..........erm.........the concept of the Prime Directive, while horrible inefficient in a whole plethora of possible scenarios is at least cause for discussion and philosophical debate and that's a good thing. There are some small moments with Wesley, Data and LaForge that are pleasant and a first attempt at character development and backstory building. Patrick Stewart is decent as he always is.Things I despisedTasha Yar is unlikeable and Denise Crosby plays her over the top and unconvincing. Over the top acting also applies to the entire bunch of guest stars. Yareena, Yar's opponent is uninteresting and the planet's leader is so over the top you wonder where the hell the writers and director were when they shot this. It's clearly a redundant TOS script. The fight to the death is filmed well and scored well but it is between 2 characters you couldn't possibly care any less about. If both were to die you would chug your beer and doze off.The Prime Directive makes its grand entrance and immediately we see how flawed it is. It would hypothetically call for whole civilizations to perish when the Federation could easily prevent it, and it leaves no room for when a Starfleet vessel encounters a species with a less than honorable code of conduct. Which means that when your officer is meant to fight to the death or someone is about to be executed for falling into flowers (don't worry, we'll get to that in a later episode) the Directive orders you to let it happen, but of course you won't. The Directive seems to be in place to prevent Starfleet from using its usually vastly superior technology to stand in the way of other civilizations' culture or development, but every single time this creates the problem that OTHER cultures DON'T have a similar Diretive, making the no.1 rule of the Federation comforting on paper but usually pointless in the real world. In the episode ""The Drumhead"" a prosecutor is shocked by the amount of times Picard has violated the PD but that just shows how imperfect it is. It seems to imply that if the Borg were to assimilate a species the Federation would just shrug and call it a vital aspect of Borg culture that we shouldn't condemn because that's arrogant. Right...ConclusionA seriously flawed episode that wasn't meant for TNG highlighting the least interesting character and introducing Starfleet's golden rule that is so flawed you wonder why they even bother to bring it up. They are not meant to aid, destroy, disrupt or affront the customs of other cultures and Star Trek went on to do little else for the rest of its existence, no matter what series or movie. The PD seems reasonable until you leave the shipyards and venture out into space. The acting is over the top, the story is boring, the ending is unsatisfying. I love TNG but this is not worth your time. 2/10. Next!",2
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Code of Honor (TV Episode 1987)",Anti Imperialism,"In this episode there are first attempts of a character development visible as well as setting the focus not only around the leading cast but also trying to include supportive ones in the plot. Data for example is making his first (of many) attempts to cope with human humor and his relation to LaForge is founded. Furthermore Riker more clearly is used as an equally treated character next to the Captain. This marks the first step on the way of splitting up the action between several places which will become common procedure in later Star Trek. The episode itself has not much to mention. The script is classically TOS as is the set design and almost everything except the new crew. Lutan is not much of an opponent neither his acting abilities nor his character and Picard and Riker carry the show almost with routine. Troi as usual is the weak spot in the TNG cast and Wesley seems out of place (once again).The conflict between the prime directive and the need for a vaccine to cure Federation colonists (one of the many Star Trek McGuffins) seems much too artificial, which robs it of the potential of carrying a message. The prime directive of the Federation is a principle quite similar to German philosopher Immanuel Kant's (1724 - 1804) ""Kategorischer Imperativ"" which in my opinion is characterized by a tremendous lack of flexibility to be applicable. Its intention clearly is to avoid a new colonial age of suppression of other cultures but as to be seen in this episode (rather involuntarily one might guess) its strictness is its greatest weakness. It downright invites other cultures with different moral standards to trick the Federation into a conflict situation to weaken their position. Surely the Federation stresses the importance of diplomacy but diplomacy is a rather uneven ground and every strictly taken principle would ruin it because creativity is the most important point to it. The Prime Directive taken literally would destroy any diplomatic attempts by the Federation because it would make their actions predictable. Whatever Gene Roddenberry may be he is not a philosopher for his concepts aren't thought-ought and with every attempt of making man better he earns so many problems... I mean, what situation is this? Saving hundreds of lives or respecting an archaic culture's code of honor? Would anyone have been harmed if the crew of the Enterprise would have taken the vaccine by force? How many people died which could have been saved, while Picard's hands were bound and the silly fight took place (exposing a crew member to a great risk)? All that doesn't make any sense to me... Conflicts between cultures and different moral systems cannot be solved by one culture always giving in to the other. This would lead to an endless circle of dominance and submission. Tolerance and respect are high values and should be protected whenever possible... But they can't weigh out responsibility for one's own people. Respect has to be earned and should not be mistaken for accepting other people's ways of living. Conflicts only can be solved with decisions which can't always be made by the book. Acceptance and respect, responsibility and tolerance must be weighed out against each other thoroughly but finally the decision has to be made. On a Starfleet vessel it is the Captain's prerogative. He has his staff (all Starfleet academy graduates, trained in Starfleet procedures what includes a set of ethical values) to advise him and his own experience to guide him. That doesn't provide him from making mistakes but that's a different story. If Picard had to be judged on his decisions during this mission his hesitant way of acting surely would not have been highly appreciated. A Captain's responsibility is first of all to his ship and its crew. All other things come second. The final solution of cheating Lutan could not be called examplary, could it? This would be a much greater sign of disrespect than (for example) having challenged him to fight or threatening him by a demonstration of power. If someone has such a strict and highly regarded code of honor, why not use it against him? In archaic cultures challenge always was an honorable thing to do... But don't get me wrong, I'm a great fan of Star Trek. Not because I agree with all of its points but because it almost exemplary (and not always voluntarily) shows how complex life, politics and ethics really are. A model society always will be a model society and nothing more. TNG will go on with its naive and often clumsy dealings with highly complex conflict situations for a while and Star Trek in a whole will never really get rid of that. But one thing's clear. You always can learn something from it, even if it means learning how you shouldn't do it. It creates conflicts but the solutions it comes up with were, are and will ever be only few of nearly infinite possibilities. That's my point of Star Trek. It makes people sensitive to philosophical issues and the more Roddenberry got away from responsibility of its execution the more interesting and sometimes even ambivalent it got...",5
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Code of Honor (TV Episode 1987)",Really Lacking in Imagination,"Once again, I feared that such a poor episode might sink the starship Enterprise. Some have called this racist but I think it's just a weak story about a male dominated world. Good heavens, about half our planet acts this way toward women. Tasha is kidnapped and put in a position where she must fight an alien woman for her life. How many times has this tired plot played out. Yar is an interesting character. She is rather masculine in appearance and has a kind of take-no-prisoners mentality. Of course, there is some complexity to this piece. There are negotiations with the indigenous beings in an attempt to solve the issue. The kicker is that these beings control a substance that is of dire importance to another interplanetary culture. The deus ex machina foolishness that eventually comes is quite unsatisfying. The culture seems set up for just such a result.",4
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Code of Honor (TV Episode 1987)",Good,"Despite the campy reputation of the first two seasons, I sometimes prefer the high melodrama here to the soft-focus light drama of the later seasons.This episode plays out much better than episode 2: the story contains true suspense as we watch Picard go from one failed solution to another, while sticking to the Prime Directive. There are a few stray ends, some good, some bad. Good: Data's attempt to understand human humour; the bad: Wesley.One glaring flaw that has stuck with me for years is the first act cliffhanger: *spoiler alert* Tasha is kidnapped right in front of Picard, and his reaction is to calmly turn towards the camera and proclaim 'red alert'. It feels like a dry read through that they accidentally had the cameras on for. Wouldn't a close-up with a helpless reaction have been better? That one moment summed up for years one of the problems I always had with TNG: the lack of 'punch' that the original series had. In any case, a good episode.7.5\10",7
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Code of Honor (TV Episode 1987)","Not as bad as the current ratings, though I am sure a few folks might be offended by this one.","The Enterprise finds itself at Ligon II--a planet with an honor- based culture and a look that is very similar to tribal Africans. Picard is actually amazingly inept dealing with these folks, and when the Lionese kidnap Lt. Yar, he thinks like a human--not like these people. Eventually, when he begins to think more like them, relations go much better--which is important since these people have a cure for a space plague and the Federation needs it.This isn't as bad an episode as the dismal current score of 5.2 would imply. It's actually pretty good. However, I do think that some people might be a bit offended by this one, as the tribal folks are all black people and the tone seems a tad patronizing.UPDATE: By the way, it isn't just me who hated this episode. At the 50th anniversary Star Trek convention in Las Vegas, this was voted as one of the 10 worst of all episodes from every Trek franchise! That is some ignoble designation! So, perhaps I was too charitable towards this one!",6

I watched this series in real time back in the 80's but that was during my heavy drinking days when shows were filtered by a lovely alcohol haze. Watching this now (sober) was shocking. Where did Rodenberry get all of those awful, over-the-top Black actors? I've seen better (believable) acting in commercials. Reading the trivia and goofs, I found that the cast of TNG and other series agree. The racist overtones were embarrassing and very inappropriate. The script was just terrible. The story line stupid and the direction was even worse. So bad that the director was fired before completing the filming. Rightly so. Many of the cast called this the ""worst"" Star Trek ever filmed.

Lutan's wife challenges Lutan's right of succession when Lutan declares he wants Tasha as his first one. Tasha is opposed to the challenge as it means a fight with Lutan's wife to the death. But, the vaccine is absolutely necessary and the fight is allowed. Tasha eventually defeats Yareena and she's quickly transported to the Enterprise. After giving the vaccine, Lutan is transported to the Enterprise suddenly by Picard and is infuriated to find Yareena alive and well. Doctor Crusher tells Lutan of Yareena's death and of how she brought her back. Yareena asks for Hagon to be her first one, who had cried out during the battle for her safety!

9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Code of Honor (TV Episode 1987)",Dishonorable,"Ugh. It's almost sufficient to write off 'Code of Honor' as just an awkward first step for the show's maiden season; the characters are still enough, and it's far more TOS than TNG. People go on about the overtones (both racist and sexist), but it's not like the Enterprise crew is actively promoting these values. Still, they don't fit and really only offer up that most awkward of commentary.But far worse than any of this is the failure to entertain.

11,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Code of Honor (TV Episode 1987)",Shallow and stereotypical,"I first watched the entire ST TOS and absolutely enjoyed it. I especially adore the PD concept. At the first glance, it seems that the concept of PM as portrayed in this episode is the same as the original one. However, it is actually too simplified and fails to capture its true meaning. The key issue is that everything is so stereotypical and there is no real depth to the understanding of the PM. Lutan is so obviously evil. His culture is so obviously backwards, inferior, barbarian, and our captain is so honorable to sacrifice his advantages for the sake of the PM. In TOS, each alien culture has its own moral complexity. The Enterprise's mission is to seek out new understanding these complexities, to help the alien culture grow, and expand our own world view. Instead this episode feels like a criminal case solving. The captain accuses Lutan for ""abducting"". Then the captain interacts with the suspect to find out his motives. A-ha! Just as the captain suspects, Lutan honorably did the abducting entirely for his own interests. Such a selfish and pompous man!The orginal series episodes tells what happens between the Enterprise personnel and alien cultures. It tells facts, without tagging judgement towards the culture's innate merits. Sure, specific, temporary actions taken by a culture could be bad, but explicit moral criticism towards a culture as a whole has very rarely been made. (It has been made several times in this episode though, for example, ""by our standards, the custom here...their code of honor, is the same kind of pompous, strutting charades that endangered our species a few centuries ago"") The Enterprise from TOS, even when its own life is at stake because of the alien culture, would always try to maintain a fair and positive attitude towards the culture. The prime directive is there to remind them to maintain this attitude when they are having a hard time. The PD in this episode seems more like some unreasonable rule made by stupid authorities.",1
12,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Code of Honor (TV Episode 1987)","Introducing the Prime Directive, Maturity, and Risk Assessment","""Code of Honor"" (Episode 3, Season 1, Air Date 10/12/87, Star-date 41235.25) introduces the prime directive as a recurring theme in 'Star Trek: The Next Generation', and it has a mature and rare assessment of the odds of Tasha's success in a fight to the death.It also has a 'Matrix' style martial arts demonstration in the hologram room. We learn briefly that strikes from holograms cause pain. We also learn that hologram fighters can learn Tasha's fighting tactics and find ways to defeat her at higher levels, so it keeps her constantly striving to improve her skills.The plot is not very entertaining or complex. But it advances some details about Star Trek and key characters. Picard is a proud Frenchman, Wesley takes ops on the bridge, and Geordi uses an electric razor since the one Data set for him is too efficient. Data tries to learn humor and fails miserably; he keeps striving to achieve the human equation to no avail.This episode seems a bit more mature since it parts ways with the dare devil and luck against improbable odds episode, 'Encounter at Farpoint'. 'Code of Honor' introduces a risk assessment of the situation for the first time. It openly discuss the odds of Tasha succeeding in a fight to the death. Usually the characters ignore probabilities and just do what is right or sympathetic or fantastic. In this episode they go with the odds; if only Spock was their to calculate the numbers for them!The whole idea of the prime directive also forces a calming mood on the series. It restricts them from swiftly acting. Picard is not even the leader of away teams up to this episode, but in this episode the customs and emphasis of honor by the Ligonians gives Picard reason to lead the away team.The Ligonians kidnap Tasha as part of their customs. Picard must play along since he is limited by the prime directive and so he cannot just take Tasha back (Picard also wants the Ligonians to trade a rare vaccine with them and open friendly relations).Also we get information about the value system of Star Trek. Picard harshly rejects the Ligonian system of honor, but he stops before launching into his reasons.The prime directive, however, is also an honor code of sorts. I think a better argument is for Picard to attack the unpredictable customs and dangerous taboos of the Ligonians. But this is a very liberal episode and the Ligonians turn out to be quite civilized despite their ways (Star Trek does not define 'civilization' in terms of technology but rather in terms of culture perhaps). Though this is a reasonable concern -- a new species or new civilization may have certain taboos that threaten successful contact with them. So this episode also starts the theme of first contact and its many difficulties.For example, Picard tricks the Ligonians and saves a death thus violating the conditions of the fight to the death. I'm not convinced this coheres with the prime directive, and it shows that it's probably impossible for Star Trek to refrain from imposing its power over lesser technologically advanced civilizations at least to some extent.This episode demonstrates that Star Trek is not merely concerned with overcoming impossible odds; it also considers rationality important as well. And it's concerned with cultural respect and not just forcing its own views onto others through the prime directive. But this goal is lofty and rare, usually people just universalize their values and attempt to hold others to them, and Star Trek has major problems faithfully sticking to it.",
13,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Code of Honor (TV Episode 1987)",like a magic cloak..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 01A promising start for the series, where cases may come and go, but the chemistry among the cast is what amps up the charge, with background still kept under the shades and just skimming off the surface of their equations, the makers have managed to tease us and hook us from the first adventure itself.Code Of HonorThe setup and the build up of the whole conflict is a bit dodgy, but in its own gullibility and morale codes the storyline just works; although the physical action with rich rituals doesn't go as anticipated.",
14,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Code of Honor (TV Episode 1987)",Yikes!,"In ""Code of Honor"", the Enterprise is tasked with visiting a planet that has developed a cure for a deadly disease that is currently behind an epidemic killing scores of people on Federation planets. Picard is in charge of diplomacy and trade negotiations for the cure. The Ligonians are a more primitive race with customs foreign to Federation mores. Men are dominant over women, yet women are the only ones allowed to own land. Their mates rule over said land and properties.The crew negotiates with Lutan, a powerful Ligonian who is impressed with Yar's physical prowess. He kidnaps Yar via transporter and declares her as his potential wife. Yar must battle Lutan's current mate Yareena to the death so she can be ""his first"".Picard doesn't intervene since the disease's cure means too much to the Federation and they have no way of replicating it. He allows the fight to occur which Yar wins. They transport Yareena back to the Enterprise and reverse the effects of the poison she took. She survives and Lutan is stripped of his title by Yareena. The crew take the antidote and leave Ligon II.I hope that this episode isn't intentionally racist. I don't think the writers meant anything by making this primitive race as an all-black race but it is extremely problematic. Star Trek has typically been pretty progressive with their takes on race and gender and sexual orientation but this episode is far from it. Even if we put aside the uncomfortable racial relations here and pretend that that's all fine (which it obviously isn't), this episode would still be a flop.The writer of this is female and I guess she wanted to show off Yar as a strong female character capable of handling things as the ship's security officer but it comes off looking so much worse. Kidnapping women and then comparing it to Native American tribalism is cringeworthy. Allowing this race of people to get away with it because of the Prime Directive also doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me in this context.The fight scene during this is also just plain awful and boring if we place it in a vacuum away from the actual plot.I really can't think of one redeeming quality to this episode. I didn't even talk about how much it angered me seeing Wes wander around the bridge. It's all just bad!",1

A very interesting episode if only because it introduces the Ferengis.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Last Outpost (TV Episode 1987)","Loved this episode, not cos of the Ferengi...","...But due to this last outpost of the tKon Empire. It was simply, a cool 50's type Science Fiction story stuck in the midst of Trek.The Ferengi steal a ""Worthless T-9 Energy Converter"" and The Enterprise D gives chase. They pass a planet and it seems that the Ferengi have got the D in some kind of energy suppressor beam. ""We push, they push back"" as Geordi tells Riker. This is also a hint that Geordi will eventually be on charge of Engineering, any time we had a 1st season engineering conundrum, Geordi solved it. But here, it's a hint of things to come.My favorite part of this episode was when they had finally turned their attention on the planet, Data pulls up a rotating stellar map in an ancient language. We can all ask, ""If the tKon Empire is out of business, how did Starfleet ever find out about it?"" - Well, we forget the United Federation of Planets, of which there are over 150 member worlds. So we can assume one of them had this information that Data pulls up before he gets stuck in an odd ""functional Impasse"" due to misuse of a Chinese finger-puzzle.In fact we never saw that same Stellar map ever again, it was used in this episode and only here.When it becomes plain that The Ferengi are not the cause of the power drain, Picard suggest both ships send away teams down to the Planet. I just loved this planet, it was an image of something truly ""alien"".And this is our first view of The Ferengi, Armin Shimmerman who would become Quark is there, but we forget Tracy Walter, who was in an early 80's movie called ""Repo Man"" - And too bad Tracy only had about 2 lines. Now these original Ferengi, these must have been the ""Ferengi Shock Troops"" - In Deep Space 9, Quark refers to these original Ferengi as ""Marauder Moe"" - Adorned in animal skins with cool Phaser-Whips. We never saw the whips, or the uniforms, ever again. Maybe the Uniforms in ""The Battle"". I see one and only one continuity error- These Original Ferengi show interest in the Gold which encases the Comm badges. Ferengi have no use for worthless gold except for Gold Dust to make bars of latimum which is their main currency. ""Gold Pressed Latinum"".But the problem was, these scrodsuckers were just too danged FUNNY for us to believe they were any kind of serious threat to the Federation! Hold that thought, the humor aspect was greatly enlarged, until delved into in Deep Space Nine, where we finally got to see their home planet, and their rules of acquisition, and their leader, Grand Nagus Zek.And so these buffoons confront the Enterprise away team on this eerie planet, it is a comedy of caricatures.But mostly I liked this guy named ""Portal"" who is the guardian of the planet. He swings a mean Axe on Riker! I thought his makeup not up to Westmore's par.I guess it was just the idea of a forgotten planet, and a sleeping guardian with unmeasurable power that was the attraction for me. If not for Riker's composure, Portal would have obliterated both ships and that would have been the end of the show right there. But Riker's solution to facing Portal was similar to the Chinese finger puzzle, the less effort used, the quicker the release from the dilemma.",10

It would be all to easy to hate the Ferengi, but I always enjoyed their appearances, and this is no exception. Making an appearance is Armin Shimmerman, the actor who would go on to brilliantly play Quark in Deep Space Nine. This is a unique appearance for the Ferengi, as they are more threatening here than their usual mild annoyance, this is shown by the fact they have purple whip things which prove rather hazardous with the Enterprise crew. Seeing a Ferengi vessel is always a treat as well. The overall episode is so-so, there is a nice bit where Riker and Portal 63 have a pleasant chat once the Ferengi are dealt with, but the novelty of this episode lies with those big eared orange dwarfs themselves.",5

An agreement is reached between both crews and both a Ferengi and Enterprise team beam to the planet to find a solution to both ships predicaments. The Ferengi are in this shown to be vicious and a lot more fearless than later in the series. Why the writers chose to change their nature in following episodes is a mystery. Their aggression in this was almost Klingon like! Less the out and out courage of course. The planet contains the remains of what used to be the T'kon empire. Gone ages since. When an agreement is eventually reached with the T'kon portal and they depart we get left wondering what part the Ferengi will play in coming adventures.

4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Last Outpost (TV Episode 1987)",An interesting episode with a rushed ending,"The Last outpost is where things get a little more interesting. Here we see a decent script, decent acting, a distinctly weird planet, the Enterprise immobilized and the introduction of the Ferengi. It's the first time TNG taking a peek from behind TOS' back and attempting to stand alone. PlotThe Eterprise is in high pursuit of a Ferengi vessel that stole some technology and is then immobilized near a planet. After some mistaken contact and deliberations it turns out the planet is the culprit and the hitherto never before seen Ferengi's are equally stuck. Picard and Taar work out an agreement of joint exploration and the two teams meet up whilst both ships lose power and life systems are in serious jeopardy. The Ferengi attack them but before the fight gets good a Guardian of a long lost Empire appears and challenges them for entering their space. Riker remains calm and convinces the Guardian that his intentions are pure. The Guardian releases both ships and both crews survive.Good StuffThe Ferengi ship is fascinating, as are their energy sticks/weapons. The planet looks great. You have to see the fight between the two away teams to believe it. Despite being presented in a ridiculous way the Ferengi already give us some insights into their culture (the greed and misogyny). Armin Shimmerman is always a delight. The Guardian looks great. The idea of a long gone empire with still active outposts defending the entrances to a extinct culture is worth a whole novel. I like the talk between Picard and Dr Bev on the acceptability of her sedating Wesley so he won't feel death coming for him.Things I dislikedThe Ferengi move and screech like howler monkey's and it's a damn shame we had to wait until Quark to get a acceptable version of a Ferengi. How you can be stranded near a planet and completely ignore it seems like a mistake befitting a raw cadet, not an experienced crew. The fact that Troi points this out only strengthens my view of how little use she is at this point in the series. The Guardian is more or less calmed down by thoughts of Sun Tzu and we get no explanation why it drains the ships' energy or why the Ferengi weapons work at first and then don't. The ending feels so rushed because they juggle the introduction of the Ferengi, the dire situation on board of the ship, and the whole T'kon empire history and outpost, making it seem too much for 40 minutes of television and calling for a rushed ending. The cast does seem a little more at ease in their roles now.ConclusionIt's not a bad episode nor a great one. I would call it decent but in season 1's ups and mostly downs that is not a bad thing. The Ferengi are introduced as the new nemesis of Starfleet but are so laughably pathetic this idea was quickly canned and instead we got the return of the Romulans and introduction of the Borg (so thank God the Ferengi idea ended in the trash can). Interesting premise with a failed introduction and a rushed ending, but not bad at all. 6/10.",6
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Last Outpost (TV Episode 1987)",Do Humans Have Such Interesting Thoughts While the Ferengi are Mere Dim Wits (Lucky with High Advancement)?,"""The Last Outpost"" (Episode 4, Season 1, Air Date 10/19/87, Stardate 41386.4) introduces the Ferengi, reflects on parts of human history, and praises human intellectual history with such examples as Sun Tzu ('The Art of War'). As I started to re-watch this episode I initially thought ""ugh, this one."" Though I actually found it more filled with imagination than I had remembered.In the episode Enterprise pursues the Ferengi with hopes of reclaiming stolen technology and learning more about the Ferengi civilization. Enterprise and the Ferengi get suddenly immobilized by force fields extending from a nearby planet, which is the last remains of an extinct empire (called Tkon).The Tkon empire had trillions in its population, spanned many planets and stars, had the power to move stars, and used planets as defensive outposts. It was completely wiped out by a supernova, though. The last planetary outpost of the empire gathers energy and acts as a power accumulator. It can also summon a sleeping guardian (referred to as Portal) from an older age of the empire to accept petitions to enter the empire and test applicants for their worthiness.Throughout the episode the plot has other interesting gems that would not come across in a typical reporting of the plot:(1) The Ferengi can somehow shield their thoughts and emotions from Deanna. They also distort their images from their ship (but we never find out how).(2) Picard and his crew reflect on the meaning of flag colors. They comment on the competition between countries in the past, but Picard seems to still have some of that nationalism leftover from earlier periods of history. He thinks France has the flag color of red, white and blue in the proper order (blue, white, red). I thought we left such divisive thoughts behind us!(3) Geordi uses a little Newtonian physics to explain the way the force field immobilizes Enterprise. It isn't a constant force, for as Enterprise tries to move, the force field pushes back with an equal push back.(4) Data cannot get out of a simple Chinese finger puzzle (or finger trap). You'd think his advanced reasoning would try a few more possibilities. Data also works on his slang ('it's nothing to write home about') in his continuing quest to mimic human oddities.I think science fiction should be as imaginative as this episode more often. As we imagine new cultures and new civilizations, we will no doubt find differences in values and in viewpoints about the definition of a civilization. The Ferengi find many human customs barbaric, and humans compare the Ferengi to the worst sort of capitalists in our own history; the sort of traders that stress the condition of 'let the buyer beware' in business dealings. But the Ferengi are at a similar level of technological advancement as the Federation (so they've done something expertly).Usually new creations and inventive new aliens in SF and fantasy are only superficially different in manifest physical characteristics and then just reflect human values in fundamentals of cultural and moral beliefs.The Ferengi succeed in being different in their ideas and values: their women wear no clothing and don't work, they don't like to communicate visually from ship to ship, they never adorn gold in wasteful ways, and they value commerce and modernization of lesser civilizations over the prime directive. But they don't have much curiosity in new ideas, and that hurts their image severely in this episode. How did they get so advanced then?Riker and his team battle against the Ferengi and both sides try to convince the Portal to release their ships. We discover a bit about the Ferengi, but the Portal is impressed with human culture and thought. Apparently the Portal guardian studied human thought when it examined the computer library on Enterprise, but in any case it considers the Ferengi as closed minded compared to Riker's interesting thoughts about Sun Tzu ('Know your enemy and know your self, and you will always be victorious').And to think that the intention of the Ferengi was to make them new bad guys! (1) Capitalists are the ultimate *adapters* to new frontiers, (2) commerce doesn't flow if a species is outright violent and constantly war-like (this reminds me of 'The Godfather'), (3) and to be successful in technology they require intelligence and innovation. Yes, they could still be unethical (by our standards) while being intelligent, but they could not be both unthoughtful and as advanced as the Federation on their own. (And the episode doesn't depict the Ferengi as forcing other intelligent beings to help them learn the technology they steal or design themselves.)So to portray the Ferengi as completely closed minded is unconvincing in the extreme. Yes, perhaps they wouldn't dwell on Sun Tzu or any other philosopher but they would certainly have to dwell on science, technology, economics, and weaponry. You don't have to love Shakespeare to have interesting thoughts! They must be thoughtful to some extent (or have access to thoughtful beings). Even if they steal technology, they still have to learn how it works.Riker compares the Ferengi to early capitalists in human history. He cannot bring himself to dismiss the Ferengi completely since they seem to him like they are at an earlier stage of human history, except they have greater power and so are more dangerous. But this breaks the typical reluctance of Star Trek to criticize other cultures. It treats Ferengi culture and values as lesser developed. Maybe its better just to call them dangerous and not compare moral conceits (since the Ferengi think it's the humans who are barbaric!).I found the Ferengi a bit unconvincing as dim witted, advanced capitalists. But the Tkon empire was interesting and it's Portal is smart to appreciate the mind of humans (I do too)!",
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Last Outpost (TV Episode 1987)",Deus ex machina (once again),"""The last outpost"" is at least for the first half one of the better episodes of the first season (whatever that means). The introduction of the Ferengi, the first real away mission and the prototype of the conference meeting which will gain importance in further episodes. Also there really is a lot of suspense on the bridge in the beginning, something TNG had big trouble to create in its beginning. The comic relief is not overly great but Data's trouble with the Chinese finger puzzle surely is an all time classic as also is his experimenting with human slang (""Something to write home about"").The script in general is one of the many ""Deus ex machina"" - scenarios which will set up a conflict finally revealed as the work of some kind of super power and solved by it, too. The Enterprise crew has to undergo a test and thereby defeating a one dimensional rival by using the superior ways of modern mankind. The Ferengi, originally planned as a new opponent for a new generation (replacing the Klingons of TOS) are introduced as a violent race, striving for commercial success. They are a caricature of neo capitalists, who put profit above all. Their appearance (at least their first one) always troubled me a bit. They are introduced as traders who really are successful (although they're methods aren't always sound). Their statue and behavior wondrously doesn't support this. Is such a Ferengi someone you would accept as a negotiating partner, especially in trading business. Are those goblins with their wild gestures and obviously deceitful intentions to be taken seriously? Surely not, at least for me. So how could they establish a trade empire?The overacting on behalf of the Ferengi as well as the final solution with the T'Kon guard leave a slightly bitter taste to that episode, so once again to point out the better moments one has to search elsewhere, below the surface of the storyline. The conference for example, which takes the relation of Picard and Riker to a higher level is definitely a breaking point. The founding stone of a more liberal way of solving conflicts. The Captain is interested in the opinions of his officers, especially his Number One's. Data also adds some depth to his character gaining experience in using Data as a comic relief. Geordi on the other hand gets himself into some trouble by over-stressing his gestures in the engineering scene with Riker. He is still searching for a substitute to compensate his eyes as an acting instrument, which will need some time. Worf and Tasha are still reduced to sidekicks only used to stress the Captain's dislike for military solutions. Troi and Crusher aren't able to add much because of their rather short parts but Crusher definitely can do with Picard (as seen in the ""waking scene"" after the ship's energy is restored). The chemistry between those tow characters (and actors as well) just works and even their smallest scenes together create a certain feeling of trust and friendship and even a bit more (warmth would be an accurate description). It's a relieve (thanks Dr. Crusher!!) that we aren't troubled by Wesley once more for he is given a sedative by his mother...Special effects (except the Ferengi ship) are really bad (the graphic in the conference room is just... you'll know, what I mean). So all in all a typically TNG first season's episode with some small highlights but at least as many discussable scenes. It's still nothing to write home about and much too hesitant to really get there where no man has been before. Roddenberry's conservatism and refusal to extend his concept will be a problem for some time to come...",6
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Last Outpost (TV Episode 1987)",Dawn of the Ferengi...,"""The Last Outpost"" marks the first appearance of the Ferengi in the Star Trek shows (though they were mentioned in an earlier one). The Ferengi steal Federation property and when the Enterprise gives chase, the Ferengi decide to fight and are FAR more aggressive than they'd be in future episodes. In this case, they begin fighting. However, the Enterprise soon is stuck in some sort of tractor beam...and so is the Ferengi ship. Who's behind this and how will they break free? And, is it even possible to work with the treacherous Ferengi to find a solution?This was a very good episode. It was intelligently written and showed a different sort of Enterprise than you normally saw in the previous series. However, it also ushers in a LONG (and occasionally annoying) number of episodes where the Enterprise is amazingly passive and non- violent--as if the future human race has perfected itself. This represents the philosophy of the new series--one that seemed to be a bit too much at times (as I preferred Kirk's less philosophical way of dealing with aliens).",8
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Last Outpost (TV Episode 1987)",Fun and Ferengi,"This episode gets things back on track. First of all, we are introduced to a new race, the ear-dominant businessmen of the universe, the Ferengi. As the crew of the Enterprise must deal with something on the surface of a strange planet that is drawing their energy, they encounter these anything-for-a-buck adversaries that will make their lives a problem for many episodes to come. These guys won't listen to reason, suspicious of anyone who gets in the way of their commerce. Unfortunately, they are experiencing the same drain of power as Picard and the crew but can't fess up about it. It requires an alliance but that is hard to negotiate. The true danger is on the planet and someone better do something. Of course, it's no secret for anyone that this marriage is not made in heaven but cooler heads prevail. For a while. Suffice it to say, the Ferengi are refreshing, unique characters with qualities unlike any others out there. They have cool speech patterns and an aggressive, self-centered being about them. Once again, they offer new challenges. This episode takes a critical situation and adds some humor. I remember that this began to revive my faith that this series was back on track.",8
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Last Outpost (TV Episode 1987)",Ostensibly the Introduction of a Big Villain,"In ""The Last Outpost"", the Enterprise is in pursuit of a Ferengi vessel after discovering it stole some equipment from an unmanned Federation station. The Federation and Ferengi have never been in direct conflict before so this is uncharted waters. Unsure of their technological prowess or even what they look like, the Enterprise finds itself caught in some kind of beam that is sucking the energy from the ship. They soon discover that the Ferengi ship is in a similar state. The energy is being sucked down to the nearest planet's surface. It appears to be a leftover outpost from an ancient empire.The two ship's agree to beam down together in a co-op away mission to try to figure out how to get out of this predicament. The Ferengi quickly double cross the Enterprise's crew however. With their energy whips they attack the away team and steal their gold chevrons. They end up awakening an ancient guardian named Portal representing the empire. He threatens to destroy them all but changes his mind after having a philosophical discussion with Riker. He spares both ship's but makes the Ferengi give back the Federation's technology.The Ferengi were intended to be the big bad of TNG but that never really worked out. Here is their first appearance and you can see why it wasn't meant to be. They're extremely annoying little goblin creatures who grate on the eyes and ears of the audience. They never seem like a huge threat, even after incapacitating the away team. They work a lot better as comedic relief.This isn't a very good episode. It has all the makings of a TOS episode with a god-like being who the humans have to win over. The whole discussion between Portal and Riker is pretty lame and nonsensical. The Chinese fingertrap gag is also something I could do without.I did enjoy the direction of this episode. We have a few really cool shots and I do enjoy the set design of the planet's surface. It's probably the best episode this far (which isn't saying too much). I think the director has a lot to do with that.This episode is noteworthy since it introduces the Ferengi for the first time chronologically in the Star Trek universe (discounting that one episode of ST: Enterprise which is kind of a loophole). Beyond that though, this episode is fairly mediocre.",5

What matters is the astounding presence of The Portal, played by Darryl Henriques, the last of the immortal guardians of a once unimaginably vast and superior empire inhabited by a race of nearly omniscient beings, who has stopped the Federation and Ferengi from functioning, leaving them dead in space and freezing as punishment for conflictual behavior in his space!

11,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Last Outpost (TV Episode 1987)",an act of war..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 01A promising start for the series, where cases may come and go, but the chemistry among the cast is what amps up the charge, with background still kept under the shades and just skimming off the surface of their equations, the makers have managed to tease us and hook us from the first adventure itself.The Lost OutpostThere is a lot to admire, lot to scoff out, either way the result is adventurous and definitely fresh- leaving their ideologies behind- the episode puts other characters up front and Stewart at the back of his seat, which is something new to experience.",
0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Where No One Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1987)",Next Gen Finds It's Footing,"This is a personal highlight from a season with little to have a song and dance about. The Enterprise is thrown many lightyears from home by a mistake made by two guests called Kosinski and the Traveller. Interestingly, the actor who plays the Traveller was in the running to play Data. It's a superb episode which shows the strength of the main cast as well as displaying some great guest performances from the wonderfully arrogant Kosinski and the mysterious Traveller. There are also some rather splendid graphics here and there. However, the corniness of this first season as a whole shines through when Picard is forced to encourage his crew to ""believe"" their way out of it, but it is a forgivable little cringe.",6
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Where No One Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1987)",Panpsychism Meets Magical Thought Power,"""Where No One Has Gone Before"" (Episode 5, Season 1, Air Date 10/26/87, Stardate 41263.1) engages us in a fantastic journey across the universe and beyond, plus it ponders metaphysical questions of the basis of reality and introduces a new power source -- thought power. Near the end of the episode the characters wonder whether the events were like magic or like a sleigh ride! The episode is memorable and thought provoking, but it mixes a few exotic ideas to make a unique story-brew.The Enterprise takes on a propulsion expert, Kosinski (and his assistant), who has a record for dramatically improving efficiencies. Riker, Data, and the chief engineer believe Kosinski is a fraud (they tried his calculations in advance and found no improvement). Deanna Troi adds early mystery since she senses nothing from Kosinski's assistant as if he is like empty space. We later learn that the assistant is an alien life form, trading his knowledge for transportation on starships to observe humans. He is called the Traveler and has the ability to travel through space-time (and deeply understand propulsion, energy, and technology). We learn that Wesley Crusher could also have these capacities in time.The Traveler finds Wesley fascinating since he sees the signs of Traveler type abilities and knowledge in him. During propulsion testing, the Traveler phases in and out of 'our' time or reality and loses control of his powers while looking at Wesley (lost in thought), setting off an accidental burst of speed. The ship hurls across the universe past warp 10 and off our scales of measurement (going 2.7 million miles to M-33).Kosinski is extremely self confident and conceited. He assures Picard he will just do what he did before to take the Enterprise back. If he can't, then it would take them more than their lifetimes to get back to where they started. But Kosinski is mostly a sham and only his assistant can get them back home. The Traveler tries to get them home, but he is so tired he loses control again and propels the Enterprise to 'where no one has gone before', at least, where no human has gone before. The essence of the new place is thought, so some thoughts a person thinks, can become reality. Wow, what an interesting place! If I could go there, I would create elephants that fly and unicorns that shoot ectoplasm out of their horns! I like the graphics of this odd new dimension or reality (that the Traveler takes them on the second burst of speed).I'll leave the rest of the plot alone to avoid major spoilers, but the episode includes several other ideas I enjoyed:(1) Wesley and the Traveler discuss the possibility that space-time and thought 'aren't the separate things they appear to be'. The Traveler asserts that thought is the basis of all reality, that it acts as a propulsive energy, and that knowledge of time, propulsion, and technology gives the Traveler (or Wesley in the future) power to travel to other realities, such as the thought dimension. These are perhaps dangerous thoughts since thoughts have power and our clumsy human minds are not ready to use such power. Like Yoda, the Traveler says we must learn control first.(2) I like the idea of needing to learn to control our thoughts. It would be interesting if the writers had applied these powers to Data. Data would have more control over his thoughts, unless his neural net is as messy as a human mind. Perhaps humans could control our thoughts better with the help of technology, but it doesn't seem likely we could control them better just by thinking really hard. We would need to evolve better mental faculties first.(3) One other of the Traveler's ideas has philosophical parallels to panpsychism though, which is the idea that intelligence exists all through nature. David Chalmers even argues that consciousness should be considered a basic property of physics akin to space-time ('The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory'). Galen Strawson argues that panpsychism follows from scientific premises ('Consciousness and Its Place in Nature: Does Physicalism Entail Panpsychism?'). These are not popular views, but popularity doesn't entail truth.(4) However, panpsychism doesn't usually involve the idea that our thoughts can propel us through space-time, nor magically help a genius understand propulsion and technology. In fact, most contemporary physicists tend to avoid the old Einsteinian way of doing physics with thought experiments and thinking by himself ('The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality'). And no one has good reason to believe in a thought dimension or thought power. So this idea seems more like magic: train your mind and you will gain power over space, time, and acceleration!(5) Is Picard's mother a projected memory or a memory embedded in reality? Or is she just Picard's version of her? Is she really 'always with him'? I thought of the movie 'Solaris' here.(6) The Traveler uses and focuses other human thoughts to intensify his power.(7) Humans have not been interesting enough to warrant investigation from a Traveler until recently.(8) Wesley becomes an acting ensign to set him on the Traveler path.(9) Excitement for scientific discovery runs high (new proto-stars are forming, new thought worlds exist right outside), but safety and getting home takes precedence.Some later episodes bring back the Traveler ('Journey's End') and panpsychism (such as in 'Haven').Panpsychism and thought powers aren't clearly stated in the episode and seem more like a sleigh ride as Geordi suggests. Maybe it's Star Trek's way of getting around the illegitimacy of ESP in today's scientific world. But this episode was so fantastical, and mixed enough with scientific excitement for new discoveries, that it solidly held my interest.",

This is also the episode that introduces The Traveler (played by Eric Menyuk) as a traveler that combines the futuristic concept (even for the 24th century) of space, time, and thought to get around the universe. Indeed, the Enterprise, though the Traveler's help, gets stuck at the edge of the universe with only him to get them back! A very interesting concept for an episode - I think they can surely expand on this concept for a feature film. The Traveler also makes a comeback in a future TNG episode (though not until the very end of the 7th season).",

Unfortunately, it involves a lot of Wesley and sort of fizzles out late in the game, but it does lure you in with some solid science fiction. The pompous engineering guy, Kosinski (onboard to push the ship's engine past its limits with a new formula) drives a lot of this, and I did like Riker politely-but-firmly keeping him in his place (Frakes' presence is surprising me in these early episodes). And the warp sequence was pretty cool.But trippy effects aside, what surpassing Warp 10 does is give this a distinct sense of adventure; barriers are broken, a new galaxy is breached and we're truly sailing into the unknown.

6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Where No One Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1987)",Quite a Mind Trip,"This is the best episode so far. What makes it so is that the laws of physics become accessible to the broad array of characters. The Enterprise and its ilk have the greatest potential but they are limited by their very structures and the forces of time and space. So we need to have a force of some kind enter the picture. This is what happens with the Traveller. We also come to realize that while raw and impulsive, Wesley Crusher is a key figure. I know he is an annoying kid, but he is the focal point here. Something must be done as the crew fly across the universe, arriving at galaxies that could only be dreamed of. The Traveller is the embodiment of an x-factor to go beyond and yet integrate the physics they are dealing with. There are some marvelous twists and turns here. Characters and objects fade in and out during warping. At some point, one has to admit some sense of defeat and draw in the forces that are not understandable to the mere mortal.

7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Where No One Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1987)",Thought.......,"This episode is one of the best of a mixed first season.

In this realm thoughts become reality and we get a tantalizing look into Tasha's troubled past on Turkana 4, a pet targ owned by Worf and even a brief glimpse at several crew members fantasies becoming reality. The budget must have been huge for this episode! We also see Picard's dead mother for a moment in a touching scene too. This was an incredibly impressive episode for such a young show! When they realize the Traveler was responsible they unite to help the Traveler through good thoughts and feelings and the Enterprise is returned home.

8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Where No One Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1987)",Waste of potential,"I'd like to make this short. Not too great a script that mainly serves to point out the special talents of Wesley Crusher, finally resulting in his promotion to acting Ensign. Kamel does his job as Kosinski, a dislikable, over-confident and arrogant Starfleet engineer quite well (but is there room for such a behavior in the 24th century?), although his humiliation in the end is a bit too peaceful. A man of his character should have fought harder for his reputation, shouldn't he? The Traveler as the ""gentle giant"" with all his understanding and care seems a bit too plastic, and the writers' intention of creating an antagonist to the Enterprise officers tending to not taking Wesley seriously, ignroing him or whatsoever is much too obvious. His merely being used for purpose destroys a lot of potential of this not revolutionary but quite intelligent set-up. After ""The naked now"" (TNG 1.2) this is the second episode blown by Wesley Crusher, my dislike of whom still growing from show to show. There also could have been a philosophic point to the show by daring to further explore the time-space-thought connection but once again Roddenberry's view is too restricted to experiment. What this show needed was a real kick off, something avantgarde leading to finally overcome the 60s TOS concept. As stated before in other comments this show's special achievements lie clearly beyond the plot. Introducing Rob Bowman (also known for his work on ""The X-Files"" in the 90s) we see what an innovative style of directing can make of a show. Those low angle shots of some bridge personnel are really something new as well as the exploration of the engineering set. But as good as the directing was, engineering seemed a bit empty without a charismatic chief engineer. At this early time of the series the problem of not having included that character became a problem. Argyle isn't the one to do the job and Riker does his best to compensate but that's not enough... Special effects are OK (and even outstanding for a TV show at this time) as are the performances of the leads. Data has to step aside for this one, leaving space for the guest cast's ""odd couple"", who for a moment seem to carry the show but the weak exit of Kasinski and the sudden disappearance of the Traveler aren't satisfying.Yvette Picard (the Captain's mother) leaves no impression, Worf's pet grants a minimal glimpse into Klingon culture and we hear some Mozart in space (one of the first influences of classical culture on the show). But why of all Wesley Crusher? I mean there's Worf, Tasha, LaForge and Troi (and Dr. Crusher as well) waiting for a chance to extend their characters and lift them above mere sidekick status. There really isn't enough room for another bridge officer and that's what Picard's temporary loss of mind promised us.

One of the worst sets in ST history... on the other hand the engine room is quite good and saves the set design of the episode.The first small step to leaving 60s movie aesthetics behind has been made but the writing concept still is stuck in its uninspired, anachronistic cage leaving only minimal potential for development...",5
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Where No One Has Gone Before (TV Episode 1987)",Where Dreams Become Reality,"In ""Where No One Has Gone Before"", a Star Fleet engineer and his assistant come aboard the Enterprise to do a few tests and adjustments to the ship's warp engine. The engineer is a bit of a jerk and does whatever he wants. A miscalculation by him causes the Enterprise to shoot off into space to a time and place never before explored. Now he must figure out how to get everyone back. Only Wes realizes that it's actually the assistant doing all the real work. This assistant is a traveler from a far off race that has never interacted with Federation races before. He has capabilities beyond that of Star Fleet and understands time, space, and the power of thoughts at an ability far beyond anything we can comprehend.This new space the Enterprise is in is pretty wild. Everyone's underlying thoughts can become reality, for better or for worse. Picard knows they need to get back home while they still have some graspe of reality. He asks all personnel to send thoughts the Traveler's way to help everyone get back. The Traveler is dying and in his last act in our time and space, brings the Enterprise back to where they were before. Picard names Wes an honorary ensign for all the help he gave in supporting the Traveler. This comes after the Traveler's parting message to Picard was to cultivate Wes's mind since he is a once in a generation genius. The Enterprise heads out for their next adventure with Wes on the bridge.Wes is the absolute worst part of this show thus far. Unfortunately for us, this is a very Wes heavy episode. Him and his dumb sweaters have their fingerprints all over it. That being said, I still enjoy this episode to some extent. We get some weird psychedelic visuals on the bridge. Plus I love everyone's surrealist thoughts that become reality. My favorite is the guy eating lunch when suddenly he's in an orchestra. I like Picard's scene with his mom. I found it pretty touching.I'm not 100% sure I fully comprehend what this plot is supposed to entail with the correlation between time, space, and your inner thoughts but it has that sci-fi quality that I find really endearing. I don't have much to explain why I like this episode but I do.",6

0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Lonely Among Us (TV Episode 1987)","Yes, It's a Very Yummy Peace Process","""Lonely Among Us"" (Episode 6, Season 1, Air Date 11/02/87, Star-date 41249.3) has an outlandish body invader theme, and toys with an idea of an intelligent energy being. It informs us about a Star Trek value: humans don't eat meat, just inorganic replicas of meat. Riker emphasizes this by saying 'we don't enslave animals for purposes of eating'. But a race on-board, the Anticans, insist on eating real meat and butchering the animals themselves!The Enterprise crew investigates an energy cloud on their way to a peace conference. They must transport representatives from the Antica and Selay races, who are prospective candidates for the Federation. The two races abhor each other and Picard and his officers learn the tireless difficulties of mediating peace negotiations between two sides that agree on very little (a recurring theme). The tasty ending might indicate that the races are not ready to be part of the Federation.The ship starts having technical difficulties after encountering an energy cloud and unknowingly taking on an energy being from the cloud. The energy being passes around the crew and ship computer, desperately trying to study navigation and find a way to get back to its cloud. It can somehow coexist inside people and computers.Here are a few notable things that short plot summaries would tend to miss:(1) I love it when Star Trek characters are given thoughtful lines. Picard comments on a long history of hostility between civilizations: they often feel hatred over different 'customs, God concepts, and even (strangely enough) economic systems'. It is difficult for people in the Star Trek world to see how people would fight over economic systems and money -- they don't work for money at all now and only work to better themselves.(2) The energy cloud travels at warp speed, but this doesn't seem to bother anyone or make them overly suspicious of it. This would have been a good spot for witty comments about human arrogance, anthropomorphizing, and disregard for different kinds of lifeforms, which would explain how the characters never seem to consider the energy cloud as the cause of all their problems.(3) Star Fleet officers must learn about the jobs of others, for we see Worf studying engineering.(4) Wesley utters the universal truism that we learn best on the job and not in the classroom. He studies a theory on dilithium crystals and warp speed, apparently Dr. Channing has an idea that the crystals would be more useful if matter and anitmatter could be aligned better.(5) Data learns about Sherlock Holmes and starts using the Holmes inductive/deductive method to solve the mysterious ship malfunctions. But he doesn't get to solve the case or successfully use his reasoning since the plot goes other places. He ends up just mimicking Holmes in superficial ways, with key phrases and a pipe. But Holmes will be back in later episodes!(6) Deanna uses hypnosis. I have actually heard that only about 1 in 10 people are susceptible to hypnosis.(7) Deanna comments about the duality in all people as they argue inside themselves, so she fails to notice that the energy being coexists in any of the crew.(8) Picard becomes an energy being! The energy being enters him and beams it-and-Picard into the cloud to try to create a unified energy being. Somehow this doesn't erase anything important about Picard. Obviously this accepts some sort of belief in an informational component of human identity, so that we exist as 'soul' or 'form' more so than as matter, or perhaps the energy contained enough energy in it to keep Picard's matter information available for re-materialization. Very weird!I didn't like the idea of the Captain turning into an energy being without complications to his identity. I thought additional explanation was needed, and if this was more like the excellent 'Where No One Has Gone Before' episode such an explanation would have been given (even if I would have thought it crazy!). It also seems strange for the energy being to coexist inside people and pass between them. This seems rather magical and more like a typical 'soul transfer' episode in a bad Season 3 episode of The Original Series of Star Trek or an episode out of 'Smallville'.I love the ending, though, in which the Anticans might be trying to eat a missing Selay delegate! (The film 'A Boy and His Dog' has a similar idea in it.) Yes, it's a very yummy peace process!",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Lonely Among Us (TV Episode 1987)",Average but some highlights,"ST:TNG:08 - ""Lonely Among Us"" (Stardate: 41249.3) - this is the 8th episode to go into production but the 7th to actually air on TV. This episode marks Colm Meaney's second appearance as Miles O'Brien (he first guest-starred as Conn in the pilot episode Encounter At Farpoint). Also the makeup effects for the two alien species is pretty top-notch (the effects have definitely improved since the Original Series). Otherwise this episode is just average in my opinion, with a storyline that is somewhat confusing until Captain Picard has to explain it to us (via the speech he gives on the bridge) near the end. Oh, for trivia fans, look out for an Original Series runabout shuttle model, can be seen behind Troi as she talks with the other senior personnel!",
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Lonely Among Us (TV Episode 1987)",One of first season's best!,"""Lonely among us"" definitely is one of the best first season episodes. The storyline, although somewhat confusing, creates a lot of suspense, supported by the creepy synthesizer-driven soundtrack. This is a typically ""alien body invasion"" scenario but finally turning out to no evil purpose (the death of assistant chief engineer Singh to me was an accident). The two delegate species deliver an entertaining frame (best make-up so far) finally adding a little black humor to the series (the final scene). Patrick Stewart obviously enjoys stepping out a bit of his Picard character and exploring some new terrain as does Data by posing as Sherlock Holmes (another all time classic). The special effects are also convincing and director Cliff Bole did his job well. He is the first one trying to compensate Trois lack in acting ability by improving her looks. She does look beautiful in some scenes and the neck of her dress improves her appearance a lot. Picard's ""lightning-scene"" on the bridge gives him a slight air of the emperor of Star Wars ""Return of the Jedi"" (which is a personal impression but made me smile).There's also some playing with the lighting of the corridors (simulating night aboard) and the first moving camera, pulling back from Picard when he's entering the transporter room to beam into the cloud... Nice work. The clever cutting, creating continuing dialog through different scenes (Troi's hypnosis report) rounds up the impression of a really well crafted TNG episode. The first one, where even Wesley Crusher seemed almost tolerable... The ending however is a bit confusing, just as if the producers were running out of time. ""P for Picard"" is a little far fetched and his return far too easy but that can be left aside regarding the many strong moments this episode has to offer...",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Lonely Among Us (TV Episode 1987)","An alien entity comes aboard and possesses different crew members including the captain, causing havoc","This seems the weakest episode of TNG so far. The plot is riddled with unnecessary characters and glaring holes:a) The Enterprise is picking up delegates of two opposing species for a peace parliament. Their presence in the plot does nothing to forward the story, offering a very little comic relief at the end. They are nothing but the fillers.b) The captain is possessed by the alien entity. The crew recognises it but is shown as helpless due to regulations. The doctor tries to order a medical examination which he refuses. Now Federation regulation clearly states that CMO has the authority to force the captain to take these exams. When the CMO fails to do it, it weakens the character and the whole episode falls.c) Data's impersonation of Sherlock Holmes is another plot point leading upto nothing. All in all, the whole episode is made on very flimsy material which doesn't even give the illusion of an episode.",3

There seems little chance that anything is going to get done. During this time a cloud is entered which alters the resolve of many significant crew members. Each of the principles seems to have a go at a new existence, acting strangely or putting forth dangerous actions and ideas. Somehow this cloud is responsible for this alteration. It is fortunate that there are those on the crew that are able to interpret things properly. Commander Data must act because for all his good intentions, Picard fall victim to the forces of the cloud. This type of dangerous entity is ongoing in many episodes. Also, it is up to someone other than Picard to come forth and deal with the issues. This is seldom done in these efforts. Good episode but somewhat derivative.",8
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Lonely Among Us (TV Episode 1987)",A Strange Episode to Say the Least,"In ""Lonely Among Us"" the Enterprise is transporting two dueling alien races both applying for entry into the Federation to a neutral site to hear their cases for Federation entry and to come to some sort of leave agreement. En route to their destination, the Enterprise passes by some fast-moving energy cloud. Shortly afterwards, Worf is zapped by an electrical panel in engineering and knocked unconscious. It soon becomes apparent to the viewer and the crew that some kind of energy being is using different crew members and computer intelligence to move about the ship for some unknown purpose.One of the engineers is killed by this being and soon the energy has transferred its way to the captain. Unsure of how to proceed, the senior officers follow Picard's orders to return to the site of the energy cloud. They have no evidence to relieve him from duty and can't stop him when he beams himself as pure energy back into the cloud to return to his/its home. Data hypothesises that they can get their captain back if they drive through the edge of the cloud again and Energy Picard knows how to transfer himself into the transporter module. Apparently Picard is thinking the same thing because it works and the captain has returned, not remembering anything that has recently occurred. Meanwhile one of the alien races is accusing the other of eating one of their delegates and Picard makes Riker deal with it.I find this episode interesting (for several reasons) but not very good. This is the first time we see Sherlock Data on the case (which I can't help but always find amusing for some reason). We also get to see a few new alien life types here in the form of the Anticans and Selay who will pop back up as background elements moving forward.This is also the most we've gotten to see of Worf thus far. He gets a few nice little scenes as the energy being's conduit. His role will expand more as the show goes along but for now, we have to be content seeing him pop up here and there.Declaring humans as a now vegetarian race is an interesting little tidbit we get here. With all the scientifically engineered food in development today hopefully we're not too far off from the diet explained by the crew here.It's interesting that the Federation would even consider membership from either of these races. Both seem set on a genocide of the other if they get the proper technology to try it (which Federation membership would invariably lead to). For now they try to capture each other with dogcatcher lassos. I laughed out loud when Riker gets inexplicably caught by one. Regardless, both sides seem like terrible candidates. I see an analog in today's society and countries currently vying to enter the EU who don't have the best track records.Anyways, like a lot of these early episodes, the plot really falls apart in the last 15 minutes or so. It's like the writers wrote too much at the beginning and try to jam everything in at the last minute. We get no real explanation of the energy being or his relationship to Picard or why they beam out together or how Picard gets back. It's all a bit too convenient for me. Everything gets real messy towards the end and then we just end up with a joke about one delegate eating another and Picard acting like it's no big deal. This would be a major incident, not a slapstick moment! I wonder what Selays taste like though?",4

9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Lonely Among Us (TV Episode 1987)",Wow...the quality of the graphics and costumes sure would get better than this.,"When I watched ""Lonely Among Us"" again, I was surprised at how crappy the look was of the show. The graphics for the planet looked poor and the costumes of the snake-like and mouse-like aliens were very poor (stiff and with unmoving mouths). This is NOT to say the show was awful--but through the course of the series, they sure got better!! Think about how the Andorians looked in the final series, ""Enterprise""--they were BRILLIANTLY made and seemed like real aliens. So much we have come to expect with costumes is the result of earlier efforts like ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"".The Enterprise is escorting two really annoying and aggressive enemies to a conference--no easy feat. However, when they come near a giant cloud in space, a new and far more serious problem develops. Soon, an electric shock attacks Worf and it passes to various crew members--and even kills Mr. Singh*! What's worse is that eventually the electric shot hits the Captain and he begins giving seemingly irrational orders.This is a pretty decent episode--even with primitive costumes and graphics. I could easily looked past this. However, I could not look past a portent of dumb things to come-having Data acting like Sherlock Holmes. This plot is just awful and would lead to one of the worst episodes of the series--the one where Moriarty takes over the ship. So, we have an interesting plot, a dumb subplot and some odd graphics compared to later ones. A mixed bag, but worth seeing if you are a fan of the series. If not, I say try another episode instead.*This is VERY sad. This was a great opportunity to FINALLY include an Indian crew member and they kill him off!!

0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Justice (TV Episode 1987)",Misapplying the Prime Directive,"""Justice"" (Episode 7, Season 1, Air Date 11/09/87, Star-date 41255.6) explores a conflict between different moral systems, and portrays a theme of seeding new colonies around the universe (to improve our survival chances). I enjoyed the liberal side of the Edo colony. We could learn much from their ability to strip away stuffy clothing customs at times!The Enterprise team arrives at an M class planet (after helping to seed a new human colony elsewhere). They are looking for some rest and relaxation. They love the beauty of the planet and think the local humanoid population, called the Edo, are completely safe.The Edo are passionate hedonists. They run around from place to place to stay fit, and they engage in sensual love making and play other enjoyable games. Their only apparent rule is that no one is to be made to do anything that makes them feel uncomfortable. Picard allows a small away team to beam down to the planet to decide whether it's a safe place for shore leave.But the team learns about dangerous and absolutist Edo laws. Wesley Crusher breaks a mundane rule about not crossing a white marker protecting plants. The Edo have a system of random punishment zones in which mediators enforce laws pertaining to those zones for a certain period of time. If anyone commits an offense, even a minor one, they get the death penalty.This obviously leaves out many components from a system of justice. Wesley doesn't get any chance to defend him self in a court, he sees no lawyer, and he gets no jury of his peers to hear his defense. If this is their system of justice, then it doesn't have much fact finding in it and it doesn't do much to protect against instances of the misapplication of the law. Suspects sometimes give false confessions and witnesses often misperceive an incident. And by the time such a misapplication would be found, the suspect would be dead.To make matters worse, the Enterprise gets visited by multidimensional beings orbiting the Edo planet. (They'd have to exist in more than just 3 dimensions to be more multidimensional than us.) The beings inhabit a partially invisible ship. They communicate electronically with Data and attain complete knowledge of humans through Data's immense library of information.We also hear an enlightened discussion about gods. The Edo believe the orbiting space station (with the multidimensional beings) is a god. Data reports that the multidimensional beings think this belief is acceptable since the Edo are at an early level of development.Data also says the beings want to observe humans before taking any action against them, but the beings are adamant that their children, the Edo, must not be removed from their planet or disturbed in any way. It seems the beings are also in the business of seeding lifeforms around the universe. But they, it seems, have left flesh and blood behind for a greater than 3 or 4 dimensional existence. Plus they are much more powerful than humans, so they could easily force us to obey Edo laws and our own laws if they want.The extremes of the Edo system of punishment make Picard's moral dilemma interesting. Picard seems twisted over whether to violate the prime directive and rescue Wesley from death. But the noninterference directive, he reasons, was never meant to force him to put his crew in such danger. His decision tries to balance competing moral principles.Bernard Williams would agree with Picard's decision to save Wesley since he believes we internalize our moral beliefs, so we do not have to 'do as Romans do when in Rome' ('Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy'). Williams actually believes in the ultimate relativity of some types of moral beliefs so he is not against exceptions to rules; but he is against just assuming that people believe dual systems of morality, both Edo and human law at the same time.In one sense the prime directive isn't even at issue. The Edo warmly welcome our kind to their planet and wish to discuss the terms of our stay. But the negotiations never take place and they hold us to their laws before we agree to them or learn them. The prime directive states that we shouldn't interfere with the natural development of other civilizations. It doesn't say we fall under Edo laws when we are already interacting with them, nor that *our* laws disappear when we visit other civilizations.Picard seems to realize that we never agreed to ignore our moral beliefs the moment we made contact with an alien civilization. And our beliefs would have prevented us from agreeing to the Edo terms of visitation.Picard and Riker announce that absolute rules are too extreme to always apply without exceptions. But a better principle would be some sort of principle of negotiation between civilizations of equal moral standing: if you want to visit us, you must obey our rules and here are our rules that you would have to obey *if* you agree to visit. If you don't like our laws, don't visit. And the prime directive would demand that we stay away and honor their refusal.Applying the prime directive in this case puts our moral system on a lower, unequal standing. The Edo shouldn't ignore our morals unless we agree otherwise. We might have tried to negotiate a treaty that allowed us to punish our own kind under our laws for such short visitations, for example.Additionally: (1) Star Fleet doesn't have a death penalty and believes it didn't act as a deterrent. (2) Picard refuses to make his decisions based on a number game: the danger of the many doesn't outweigh his moral consideration of the one.I found the episode filled with interesting moral questions but also with excellent themes of colonization and diverse stages of religious worship.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Justice (TV Episode 1987)",1 over a 1000,"ST:TNG:09 - ""Justice"" (Stardate: 41255.6), this is the 9th episode to be made but the 8th episode to air on TV. This episode brings a moral dilemma - should you override one's own laws to rescue one life - should laws be that absolute? And as Data put it to Picard, ""Would you choose 1 over a 1000 lives?"" This is a question that for me hearkens back to what Spock said in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (when he said it was logical to sacrifice one for the many or a few), and one that fittingly reminds us that The Next Generation, which is still in its infancy at this point, still resides in the same universe as the Original Series. This is truly an episode which is at the very heart of Roddenberry's vision.",
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Justice (TV Episode 1987)",First season's worst one,"This episode does contain everything a really bad Star Trek show needs. A plastic conflict, created merely for moral purpose, a sentimental, naive way of raising theological and philosophical questions and an easy one dimensional solution at last. Furthermore there's not the slightest moment of suspense or innovation to this one. It's plain boring... Questioning death penalty is a highly complex matter, as is comparing different law and moral systems. But the biggest impudence is that God thing. Couldn't they have thought of something more intelligent and original? The cast seems to have felt as uneasy with it during production as I did while watching. McFadden is unconcentrated and delivers one of her worst performances, showing that there is everything but a loving relationship between her and Wesley (or Will Wheaton). Picard's overly harsh treatment of Data quite set me up as well as the latter one's relapse to an earlier state of development. We may be in the 9th episode but Data already has learned a lot about humans, though surely not enough to prevent any conflict sufficient to know what is considered important. Picard's silly speech at the end finishes this one off and leaves the audience in despair (or should I say outrage?)...The Edo do have some lovely girls and the idea of a paradise-like society is as old as mankind itself but that's not enough to get away with. We see Picard's quarters for the first time (why does Dr. Crusher enter without permission?) and the opening shot, showing the Captain's face from a low angle while circling around him has something to it but all the rest is pure rubbish (should I exclude Worf's remarks on Klingon sexuality?). And honestly, has anyone ever believed, Wesley would die in the end (I for my part kept hoping, although I knew better)?I want to watch Star Trek to get inspiration and not a lecture on simple solutions.",2

Things quickly go awry however when the ship discovers a multi-dimensional semi-transparent vessel orbiting next to it. Things get more dire when Wesley is sentenced to death for accidentally breaking a law he didn't know existed. The alien vessel claims the Edo as its children and the Edo worship it as a god. Their rules and laws come from it and every crime is punishable by death. Picard tries to figure out a way to free Wesley without breaking the Prime Directive.Data interacts with Edo's god, exchanging information with it, showing it all that he knows. Dr. Crusher pleads with Picard to save Wesley no mater the cost or repercussions.In the end, Picard breaks the Prime Directive. The god allows them to beam Wesley out without too big of an incident. The Edo don't agree but stand idly by as they leave. Picard probably soiled relations with the Edo people for Federation purposes but everyone escapes alive.Woof! This one is the worst of the early first season bunch, a season that's been fairly dismal even before this. It has Gene's fingerprints all over it: an all-powerful God, a ham-fisted moral quandary that's not as deep as it's made out to be, and a bunch of scantily clad women running around. This would have fit right in in TOS Season 3 but it makes for a bad TNG episode.It's heavily implied (if not downright said) that this is a sex planet. I'm pretty sure that first away team including Riker and Yar had some massive orgies or something judging by the greeting they get when they come back with Worf, Wes, and Deanna.Also, I think this is a good lesson for Picard never to send children on early away team missions, regardless of how amiable the planet and people seem to be. That seems like a terrible decision in retrospect.We did get a reprieve from Wesley for a while while he was locked up on death row. It was pure bliss not having his annoying presence on the screen for most of the middle of the episode.The ending is just as bad as the build up here. Picard does all this posturing on this moral dilemma he has but it never seems real. It's clear they'll always save the boy. They're not going to let him die just because there's the slight possibility it might cause the other ship to destroy theirs. I also don't understand where that idea comes from? At no point does the other ship imply that it'll kill them if they take Wesley back. So why are we so concerned about it? If anything this psuedo-god probably wants them all off the planet so they'll stop bugging his ""children"".Data's scene where he reveals the ship is more than just one entity reveals nothing to the audience, nor is Picard justified in yelling at Data for something he's programmed to do.I can't think of many positives to this episode. It introduces the Prime Directive to TNG at a grand scale but I'm not even sure if it's applied directly. This situation is way different than how I understand the Directive. I thought it was mostly for uncontacted planets? It's about not interfering with a planet's development. This is clearly a different situation since the Edo know about their vehicle in the sky and their different way of life. It all seems a bit silly for this episode to drag on like this when we know Wesley is going to be beamed up whether the Edo like it or not. I doubt that they'll throw their judicial system aside just because some alien shows up and destroys a few plants. I think the writer of this episode and Picard need a refresher on what the Prime Directive is and its intention.",2

These people are very welcoming and Picard is interested in investigating the place for shore leave. Naturally, the intergalactic player, Riker, is in favor of this, as the place is full of good looking people who LOVE sex...much like Ryker! However, there is a hidden down side to the place. While it's mostly about pleasure and relaxing, there is a local taboo--one that is insanely arbitrary. And, when Wesley breaks the taboo, the locals want to put him to death. Based on what many people thought of this character, this MIGHT have been a great idea and would have been in keeping with the Prime Directive! In addition to this plot, the ship's sensors see some anomaly--something that MIGHT be there but isn't. Eventually, they locate some sort of floating space craft that warns the crew NOT to bother the inhabitants on the planet. To further communicate with the humans, the entity takes over Data and makes him become inert--like he's dead.The is a very good episode of the series--quite memorable and a great example of the problems which might result from the Prime Directive. Well worth seeing and a truly novel plot.",8
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Justice (TV Episode 1987)",Troubling....,"It seems that science fiction is always raising questions that have no easy answers. Often, sci-fi is almost prophetic in critiquing the way things are by presenting alternative futures. Sci-fi has a long history of social critique.This episode of ST:TNG is particularly troubling in two ways: the questions and issues it initially raises, and the ease with which it evades actually probing or answering those issues. The beginning point is a question of justice: how can we regard as just any system in which the legal consequence of every crime is the same, or in this case death? This is troubling for some of the metaphysical questions it raises, especially if you are a Christian, a Muslim, or a Jew (and not just a Jew in the cultural or ethnic sense): is God just in setting eternal consequences for our actions? Is God just in setting the same eternal consequence for every bad deed or lack of good deed? Is God just in judging all people by the same standard? Beyond that, there is also the question of whether humanity itself (presumably Western civilizations in particular) now saddles itself with unjust laws and punishments which do not ""fit the crime."" If this episode had chosen to actually deal with those questions (or for that matter raised them in a less simplistic scenario) it could have been one of the best episodes of the entire series. Instead, we have a speech and Picard and crew pretty much do what we've known they could do all along. It was sad, easy, and anticlimactic.",4
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Justice (TV Episode 1987)",Don't crush the grass Wesley,"In this episode from the first season Patrick Stewart is put into a real moral dilemma. He finds a peaceful planet and the crew interacts well with the natives

soccer until he steps on the lawn to retrieve the ball. All life even the grass is
sacred and no wilful destroying of any is tolerated. The punishment for this
infraction is capital as it is for just about every offense.A truly ridiculous position, but one held dear by the planet overseers including
a large alien presence that orbits the planet and watches out like a mother
lion for her cubs. At one point it decides to get rough with alien earthlings
that mostly are the Enterprise crew. As you can see Captain Picard has his
hands full. Mostly because of StarFleets omnipresent Prime Directive.Not good enough for Gates McFadden and Doctor Beverly Crusher is not about
to see her son executed for nonsense.This is one of many episodes, in this case the first of many where the Prime
Directive can be nonsensical if stretched beyond reason.",7
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Justice (TV Episode 1987)",The most ridiculous law ever,"So far this first TNG season has (if you count the pilot as one episode, which I think you should) had 7 episodes, including this one. 2 of them had the characters acting unusual (which is ridiculous since we haven't even established a ground for comparison) but 2 episodes have focused on Wesley. The first was okay, albeit sickly sweet in its ending, but this one isn't. It just isn't.PLOT (SPOILERS)The Enterprise crew visit the Edo,a oversexed bunch of bronzed and blond superhumans (aliens of course, but identical to humans, go figure) that will rub up against anything and anyone they encounter. The ship encounters a object in space claiming to be the Edo God. Whilst playing with Edo kids Wesley breaks a glass greenhouse, and is almost put to death by Edo coppers. This means a diplomatic standoff between Starfleet and the Edo. Picard has the bureaucratic nightmare of keeping his semi-crush Crusher happy, saving Wesley, not insulting the Edo, not getting destroyed by the Edo God and stick to Federation rules. After a compromise cannot be reached Picard out-speeches the God and beams up Wesley and they warp away.THINGS I LIKED..........I guess the Edo God?THINGS I DISPISEDNot even Worf could crack my smile with his ""Nice planet"" when hugged by the admittedly extremely attractive Rivan. I'm surprised Troi didn't get jealous with her present. The Edo look ridiculous in their revealing pink half-suits. I hate the idea that these people are so carefree and happy when the slightest offense will get you the death penalty. Usually dystopias do not look like the Garden of Eden. I refuse to believe a species like this can live like this. We learn pretty much nothing about the Edo God making it a plot device, although it is nice to see the Enterprise outclassed -it will not happen many times more.But all of this isn't even the main problem. Since Wesley's life is at stake, the episode will only succeed if the audience remotely cares for this boy, which would be a big fat NO! Wesley in this stage is such a dweeb, such a eager-to-please non-entity. His perfect day is having breakfast with his mother, getting good grades in school, being on the Bridge, getting a compliment from Riker or the Captain, and then go to sleep in his pink room filled with stuffed unicorns and a framed picture of Picard. Only later will I get some respect for the boy. I liked him in Evolution until he ruins it with one sentence, and I liked the ideas of him being moody because of expectations and choosing a non- Starfleet path. However, that is done so much better with Jake Sisko, who suffers because of the expectations coming from being Sisko's son, everyone thinking he will go to the Academy, and, in the end, choosing a non- Starfleet path. Why does it work for him? Because he is a good character. When he says: ""Yo, instead of getting killed by Jem Hadar and not even getting paid for it, I'm gonna write and not be paid for it (which is basically my life at the moment)"" we can only applaud him.The other big problem is the other Crusher. Has a mother ever been less concerned for her child? She seems more involved in Symbiosis about drug addicts. Maybe even she hates Wesley, who knows? But her imploring the Captain and shutting up Data when he lacks subtlety is horrible to behold. I just didn't buy it. Gates McFadden is a dancer first and an actress second and it shows here. The last big problem is the same we have with A Matter Of Persopective when Riker gets wrongly accused of murder and may go to jail. Not for one second do we believe Riker is guilty, or will be found guilty, or Picard letting Wesley die in Edo hands. This takes away a lot of interest you may have for this episode and after 20 minutes you'll be watching for the good looking Edo, not for the story if I may use that word so callously here.CONCLUSIONYou can probably tell I do not like this episode and I consider it to be second only to Code of Honor (ugh) in the category of Worst TNG episode, hell even Worst Star Trek Episode. Just don't watch it. You'll laugh only once perhaps, and then get bored. Really, really bored.

Also this episode ha some of the simplest views over the issue of capitol punishment, not delving into the complexity of it.

An ongoing theme is that very strict rules apply to these explorers, yet they must have a contingency for potentially destructive behavior. I've never been too fond of sacrificing life for something ambiguous and philosophical. I didn't think Socrates should have drunk the hemlock and the arbitrary sentence for a pretty insignificant action needs to be resisted.

This necessarily includes understanding the //implications// of the rules -- especially those implications that aren't immediately obvious. *The Prime Directive was originally intended to prevent the Federation from interfering in the ""normal"" development of a society (unless, of course, it was ""degenerate"" in a way that ""justified"" interference -- qv, ""The Apple"", which strongly resembles ""Justice""). It should have been obvious //from the beginning of TOS// that the arrival of beings from an unknown ""other place"" //is// interference, no matter how you choose to define it. Hence the later refinement of the Prime Directive to make contact only with space-faring civilizations.The writers -- perhaps at Roddenberry's suggestion -- came up with a ""Planet of the Horny Blonds"" story, then concocted a situation that brought the Enterprise into conflict with the Edo society.Granted, the story's point -- the need to respect other peoples' laws and mores -- is a good one, but the situation seems so forced and in-organic that it's not plausible. Its only purpose seems to show that Picard is clever enough to get the Edos' god to change its mind -- in itself, an act of gross interference, likely to have severe repercussions once the Edo learn of it. (The obvious question of why the Edo god didn't prevent the Enterprise from contacting the Edo in the first place isn't answered.)Another unanswered question is how application of the death penalty to what are generally trivial and arbitrary infractions is supposed to deter the Edo from theft and murder? Are the Edo so dispassionate that homicidal jealousy doesn't occasionally rear its head?* Asimov had fun with thin in his robot stories, most of which revolve around humans not anticipating how their commands to robot would interact with the three laws of robotics.",3

I initially thought the episode didn't have much to offer (and I still think it's on the light side of ideas), but we do learn a few interesting things about the Star Trek world.The revengeful Ferengi (DaiMon Bok) spent his life accumulating money to buy two thought disruptors (and amplifiers) to use against Picard. He uses this technology to send thoughts to Picard, create painful sensations in Picard's mind (just a headache at first), and force Picard to have delusions.Bok is able to take control of Picard and force him to relive past memories. First Bok gives Star Fleet a gift of Picard's old USS Stargazer ship. His goal is to use his thought manipulator devise to get Picard to transport over to the Stragazer and attack the Enterprise, thinking it was the old Ferengi vessel from 9 years prior. All of this is done through signals sent to Picard's mind and to get Picard killed.Bok also creates fake log entries to create false evidence against Picard, and in general to make Captain Picard feel disoriented and regretful of destroying a Ferengi vessel at the battle of Maxia. (Bok's son was the DaiMon of that vessel.) In any case, I was interested to see a discussion on Star Fleet medical advancements. Headaches are so rare that Dr. Crusher can't believe Picard even has one. Apparently, the Star Trek world has advanced so much that it has mapped most of the causes of pain in the brain.Plus we continue to get glimpses into command structure, for only Dr. Crusher can order Picard around (to require him to have further medical testing). We also saw this in 'Lonley Among Us' (episode 6, Season 1) in which the crew had to make certain Picard was under alien influence before relieving him of command (the First Officer could do it if he was certain of an alien influence and had the consent of the other top officers, but Dr. Crusher could relieve Picard on her own if she had medical evidence of unfitness).We also get to see a very cool military maneuver, now called the Picard Maneuver, in which he once quickly went into warp speed to make it appear that his ship was in two places at once so that an enemy vessel might fire on the wrong image of his ship.A few minor themes include Data's search for any tampering in Picard's old log files. Data also uses his advanced reasoning to create a counter to the Picard Maneuver. It's good to have an android on hand! So I saw two main SF themes: medical advancements and ship military tactics in the Star Trek world. I have seen the tag 'SF military' (or thereabouts) on Amazon and other sites, so many films and books are built around the theme of SF war in the future. This episode is in that tradition, with the addition of a revenge story, medical mystery, and thought control devices. We also find out more about Picard's history and Data's abilities.",

The Ferengi arrive and Daimon Bok is hell bent on avenging his dead son whose ship Picard destroyed whilst commanding the USS Stargazer. The Ferengi have a mind controlling device and Picard boards Stargazer and engages Enterprise. We learn of a now established 'Picard maneuver' and it is about to be used on the Enterprise.

Obviously this is an attempt by DaiMon Bok to exact revenge for this incident...but how will this result in his punishing Picard? Had the Federation come upon the Ferengi offer of a 'gift' later in the series, it obviously would have been seen as a trap. However, this was only the second encounter with this annoying species--so the humans have no idea what's REALLY going on in this episode. So, it is not a weak episode--just one that explains just who the Ferengi are and how they think.

The Ferengi ""thought maker"" and the revenge plot around Daimon Bok wanting to make Picard pay for killing his son in the Battle of Maxia are just McGuffins to enable Patrick Stewart to add some depth to his character by exploring it. So Star Trek is not always about exploration of the outer space but also of the inner space (the human mind, memory, psyche or whatever you want to call it). Patrick Stewart has the chance to carry the whole show and he delivers a marvelous performance, dropping his shield of reason and authority and portraying a weak and almost helpless Picard tormented by a strange pain (although created by the Ferengi device on screen, this represents his unfinished business with this event of his past in the subtext). Dr. Crusher is also convincing as the caring physician trying to help the pain ridden Captain and stating that for her the Captain's health is not only a matter of duty but of deep personal care.Rob Bowman (director) moves on with creating modern ST aesthetics by delivering some nice shots of the improved Captain's quarters set and supporting Stewart's acting abilities with some close up shots gratefully taken by the latter. This episode marks the point in Star Trek where ""real"" acting moved in. This moment at the latest should have made it clear to the producers that they had a first rate actor on top of their show granting them much space to play with the character... But as many good points this one may have, it's again Wesley Crusher who almost ruins it with his silly moments (incidentally finding out about the connection between the Ferengi and the Captain's headache and his silly remark on ""adults"", intended as a comic relief but resulting in hating that character even more.

7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Battle (TV Episode 1987)",Ferengi Revenge,"A Ferengi captain is on a mission of vengeance. He contacts the Enterprise, hailing Picard as a hero, and returning a ship that was in an historic battle nine years previously. Interestingly, a Ferengi ship was destroyed by Picard, so what's going on. The Ferengi, being consummate businessmen, are acting strangely, offering the ship to Picard. Meanwhile, Picard begins suffering debilitating headaches that have no obvious source. During the events that follow, it is obvious that the Ferengi captain is causing all this. It appears that he needs to change history for some reason, making Picard appear a coward. This is an interesting episode although the science is suspect. So often we have to accept machines, allowing our skepticism to subside. The Ferengi captain has conveniently created an orb that can affect the human brain. No one ever explains how he does this. Anyway, the table is set and the villains are in place. Go along for the ride. A decent enough episode.",7
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Battle (TV Episode 1987)",The Ghosts in Picard's Closet,"In ""The Battle"" the Enterprise is sent on a diplomatic mission of unknown purpose with the Ferengi. It turns out they are returning an old Federation ship, the Stargazer. Picard used to command it before him and his crew were forced to abandon it after taking heavy damage in a space battle with an unidentified ship. Picard destroyed his enemy but was never able to salvage the Stargazer. Now the Ferengi are returning for free with no profits to speak of.Picard has been suffering of headaches of late which is odd since common headaches have been basically cured for decades now. They seem to be getting worse now that the Stargazer is under Enterprise control. We learn that the Ferengi vessel is emitting low frequency waves that match Picard's brain waves that Crusher scans.It turns out the DaiMon of the ship has a vendetta against Kirk. The ship the Stargazer destroyed with the Picard Maneuver was captained by the son of the current Daimon. He's forgoing profit for this revenge mission. He uses a pair of spheres that control Picard's mind.Picard beams over to the Stargazer alone and the DaiMon convinces him he's back to the original battle. Picard tries to attack the Enterprise in his confusion by Data counteracts the Picard Maneuver with the ship's tractor beam. Riker is able to snap Picard out of it and gets him to destroy the mind control sphere. The first officer takes control of the Ferengi vessel, jailing the DaiMon for this unprofitable venture.I've never been a big fan of the Ferengi as a serious villain but I do kind of enjoy this episode. We get to see some ghosts in Picard's closet via the flashback scenes and dream-like sequences. I like that he's a bit older and starts questioning his own sanity and memories when he hears the doctored Captain's Log. There's barely any Wesley in this episode which I deem a plus.I also like the mutual understanding and respect we see between the two first officers here. Both their captains are caught up in their own plot while the two Number Ones are forced to command their respective ship's without them.The plot goes by pretty quick with no big lulls or boring scenes. As far as Season 1 thus far, this has been one if the highlights... which isn't saying a whole lot.",6
0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Hide and Q (TV Episode 1987)",Riker's temptation,"""Hide and Q"" just doesn't work for me. Surely, confronting man with the possibility of unlimited power is a challenging concept but I think the way presented here isn't the one to deal with such matter. First of all, Riker is the obvious choice for the ""God candidate"" (who else should it have been, Worf?). But to be honest I can't stand him laughing. He overplays his new role to the limit with his meaningful looks and clumsy arrogance. Sure, Riker's an eager officer and loyal to his colleagues but what I had wished for was reaching deeper into his character to clearly state out what his new powers could mean to him... Idon't know if Frakes would have had the ability to do so at the time (I would almost say no) but such a highly complex matter deserves to be taken seriously. Wouldn't it have traumatized him or given him a mental breakdown or simply blown his mind? And honestly: Riker's conflict about having been able to save the child. Is that all he was thinking about at the moment? Here comes the point which makes clear that this is just another episode awkwardly trying to create a pseudo-theological conflict. It's not Riker we're interested in but only the ""what-would-be-if"" kind of thing finally resulting in the overly simple solution of realizing that keeping to our true selves is the best thing to do. But the script's way too superficial on that. Shakespeare knew what he wrote about and his lines weigh a lot and it's quite a shame to abuse his work for such purpose (although the Q/Picard ""Shakespeare-battle"" is a funny thing). Besides Riker, interestingly it's Data who ruins this show. What had happened to him? Did he just out of nothing develop a kind of conscience? How that? And what's his silly question at the end about Q having problems to deal with humans? I'm glad the producers dropped that kind of Data-parts soon... Another thing is the ""game"" Q creates. First of all the set. It's so bad that even the most talented director couldn't have made anything out of it. So, no fault on behalf of Cliff Bole. Wouldn't it have been ""game"" enough for Q just letting the crew execute their rescue mission and watching how Riker behaves? Wouldn't that have been temptation enough? I do think so... And once again Wesley. Why didn't Riker just let him die? Second opportunity missed...It's quite a torture to see Star Trek struggling for its way and dealing with quite intelligent concepts in a silly, childish and one dimensional way. Please Mr. Roddenberry, let go... (He finally did and look what became of TNG). Riker's worst performance so far and Q's much better than in the pilot (although deLancie almost gave in to the temptation of falling back to classic 60s villainy). A new set of the Enterprise's corridors was introduced here and for my part that's all to mention here.",5
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Hide and Q (TV Episode 1987)",Exaggerating the Human Equation,"The Enterprise is on its way to help a Federation colony in the Sigma III system when the Q appears and prevents them from their mission. The Q wears a Star Fleet admiral uniform and then a Napoleonic marshal uniform, and then he has the crew battle against some sort of humanoid creature. It's a Q episode but it also has an interesting question about the difficulty of science (and extremely intelligent beings) to successfully predict chaotic and complex phenomenon, such as human psychology.""Hide and Q"" (Episode 9, Season 1, Air Date 11/23/87, Star-date 41590.5) poses the interesting possibility that 'the human equation' is more difficult to manipulate and understand than basic laws of space-time. We find this evident in the physics of today; modern physics never uses its basic principles of relativity or quantum mechanics to *precisely* control (in as quantifiable a way as in a physics experiment) human psychological reactions or behaviors.This idea becomes explicit at the end of the episode. But the whole episode can be read as making this point through a series of failures by Q. Q tempts Riker with the incentive of becoming a Q in the hopes of having Riker teach the Q about the human desire to change, grow, and advance (more on this below). But Q also wants Riker to enjoy using Q powers by suggesting to Riker that he give all the top officers their deepest wish, with bad results -- the Enterprise crew doesn't want to achieve their goals and get what they want through magic.Picard seems to know in advance that Riker will fail; perhaps suggesting that humans are in a better position to understand human psychology than an all powerful god-like entity. Perhaps Riker was blinded and corrupted by his temporary immense powers to fail to see the same thing. But it's also possible that Picard is granted too much knowledge, or plays an 'I told you so' type game in which he claims to have known in advance what we usually just learn after the fact through experience. Wesley, for example, gladly accepts his prize from Riker and only rejects it after he thinks about it for awhile.I'm not sure why the Q entities don't have human type desires to advance and grow. For some reason Q fears the potential of humans (and that is why he recruits Riker). But I'm not sure this desire to advance is special to humans at all. It would seem to be a feature of all major Star Trek civilizations that advance, change, adapt, progress, etc. I doubt the Vulcans lack it. But perhaps the Q entities are so advanced they lost the desire to advance through evolution. (Though perhaps humans would lose such a desire as well if they could do all the things a Q can do.)And some human communities don't advance at all, and instead live by traditions from hundreds of years ago (as Jacob Bronowski points out in his excellent science documentary 'The Ascent of Man'). So there is nothing inherent in our humanity that forces us to advance at our current state of evolution. Such tribes may not exist in the future, but, even so, some individuals may still be lazy or depressed in such a uniformly modernized world.In one sense the episode has the human equation correct -- human psychology and behavior and emotion is very unpredictable even for a Q perhaps. But the same can be said of the weather and economics to some extent. It seems to me the episode lacks thoughtfulness and perspective on these kinds of questions, and it exaggerates its 'human equation' idea (or perhaps fails to develop it fully enough, to put it nicer).Otherwise it's mainly an episode for fans of the Q, fantasy, and humanistic literature. I did like the quotes from Shakespeare: the world is like a play or stage (but, Q notes, 'if Shakespeare were alive he would have said *the galaxy* is like a stage' -- no, I think he would have said *the universe* is like a stage!). If you also catch the quote from 'Hamlet', then you'll find some thoughtful ideas about our humanity in this episode. And Q allows them to take center stage.But I'm not a fan of Q and I'd rather see these views of humanity mixed with more pure SF. So there wasn't anything of interest at all for me until the end when they commented on 'the human equation' and only then did I have something to write about!",

The teleplay is by Gene Roddenberry himself (the creator of Star Trek) and deals with whether one man can overcome the temptations of limitless power including stopping time which is shown in this episode - of course when it comes to this type of power, Q is involved (this is his second appearance in the series). It also shows that Roddenberry thinks that humans will evolve for sure to the level of the Q given enough time (this is what Q reveals to Riker). This episode also introduces the Q Continuum, the place where Q and his kind come from.",
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Hide and Q (TV Episode 1987)",Preachy,"Initially, I strongly disliked the Q episodes...though over time they got better and better--and seemed to have a point to them. But at this point, he still appears to be a butt-head who simply takes delight in jerking the Federation around and toying with the Enterprise. In this case, he takes a group of crew members (led by Riker) to a lonely planet and treats them as honored guests...at least initially. During this meeting, he proposes a game-- one where he endows Riker with AMAZING Q-like powers. And, you wonder if all this power might corrupt Riker...how it might change him into something other than a loyal member of the Federation.Overall, this comes off as a VERY preachy episode of the series and really doesn't do a lot to endear the viewer towards Q--a being you'll come to really like in later episodes. A bit dull and far from enjoyable.",5

His lack of interest in the emergency to Enterprise was en route to was cold and typical Q. He whisks the main crew off to a planet and offers Riker the power of the Q. The old adage of 'power corrupts, and a absolute power corrupts absolutely' applies here and there are plenty of biblical references about the temptation of leading the good to sin. Interestingly, when Riker refuses to save a dead girl with his new powers it sends him into a spin. His arrogance eventually becomes evident to the extent of regarding the Captain on a first name basis! Eventually Riker makes the offer of providing a special gift for his fellow Bridge Officers. Watch as Picard sits back confidently and endorses and even encourages this. Riker then presents his gifts and is turned down each in turn by all. Picard sits triumphant as Q is whisked away by his fellow Q and the viewer is left to wonder is this the last of Q?",7

After transporting the bridge crew sans Picard down to an unidentified plant and forcing them battle with alien forces dressed up in French Revolutionary garb, Q gives Riker all the powers of the Q to do with whatever he pleases.Picard warns Riker that humanity is not ready yet for anyone to have so great a power. Riker promises to never use it again after saving the crew of the Enterprise from Q's trap. He lives to regret that when they show up to the mining colony and a girl dies just before Crusher can save her.In an attempt to appease the crew if the Enterprise, Riker offers to give them all gifts. They all feel unsettled by this. Riker offers Wesley adulthood, skipping all those awkward teenage years. He offers Data the chance to be an actual human. Geordi is offered his vision. Worf is offered a Klingon mate to accompany him in the Enterprise. But all these gifts are rejected by the crew since they just don't feel right. Riker, understanding the error of his ways, asks Q to remove the powers from him and put him back to normal. Q leaves in a huff and the Enterprise continues on unscathed.The first return of Q! Like a nagging pest, Q won't leave the Enterprise alone here in the first season, always interrupting a mission at the most inopportune time. Here he thinks he's found a weakness in the crew in the form of Riker, someone who can get sucked into temptation (and he's not wrong). But alas, Q underestimates humanity again. One of the crew mentions in this episode how Q can understand time and space so well yet still be so in the dark about how humanity operates. I found that quote interesting if not a but misguided.All in all, this episode is okay for a Q episode. I liked their time on the planet's surface and the dumb pig soldiers that Q created for them to fight. I typically enjoy little anachronisms like that; I don't know why...The set is pretty atrocious though. I like the way Riker gifts everyone what he believes to be their greatest desires, only for everyone to reject him. I think there might be a bit TOO much Q in this episode. He's better in smaller doses but he's all over this episode which might be its downfall.The ""game"" he sets up for the crew doesn't really make all that much sense. The moral quandary Riker is supposedly dealing with is half-baked at best here and screams of some kind of adapted-for-Q TOS script. I know this show gets better on in later seasons, but sometimes this first one can be a bit of a slog.",5

If there is such a thing as the ""Continuum,"" don't we suddenly get into issues of religion or the purpose of life. Q seems to be playing games, but he isn't even a corporeal being unless he chooses to be so. Why does the Enterprise even matter to him. Being at one with the universe, he must have other fish to fry. In this episode, he decides to test the human's morality by giving them powers (at least he does to Riker) and then goes about doing nasty things to other crew members. If he can do whatever he wants, what does he matter? Why does anything else matter? Get my drift. This is the same argument I have with religions, especially those that take away human self direction. Of course, we don't have to think too much to see that our gang will somehow overcome all this, or at least appease our intergalactic pest.

8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Hide and Q (TV Episode 1987)",the greatest possible future..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 01A promising start for the series, where cases may come and go, but the chemistry among the cast is what amps up the charge, with background still kept under the shades and just skimming off the surface of their equations, the makers have managed to tease us and hook us from the first adventure itself.Hide And Q

Here, she makes her first appearance--and one of her most obnoxious and memorable ones. It seems that Deanna has been pledged to marry a human by their respective families and she is prepared to honor this. However, there are two huge problems--she really doesn't know her fiancé and Lwaxana seems to be trying her best to be obnoxious and unlikable towards everyone--particularly the groom's family. Again and again, she says and does things that right fully infuriate EVERYONE. It's all quite funny and makes this the first lighthearted episode of the series- -something sorely needed since the prior episodes were all so darn serious! Interestingly, Deanna's spouse-to-be, turns out to be an amazingly nice and decent guy. Heck, I would have been happy to marry him--and I am a straight guy! But, somehow the wedding doesn't come off as planned. How and why, you'll just need to see for yourself.All in all, this is one of the best episodes of the first series.

Lwaxana comes to the Enterprise to see her ""Little One"" get married. It is the Lwaxana element that makes this episode one of the more worthwhile of the first season. Indeed, this episode is very funny at the right moments (and there are many of those moments!). It also reintroduces the Imzadi concept between Riker and Troi (that was introduced in Encounter At Farpoint) and would be resolved (so far) in Star Trek: Nemesis. I would highly recommend this episode to anyone.",
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Haven (TV Episode 1987)",Panpsychism Returns Amid Marriage Arrangments and a Tarellian Threat,"Like the Vulcans, the Betazoids arrange marriages at an early age and now it's Deanna's time to meet her fiancée. Deanna Troi accepts her people's tradition despite her half human background, but it doesn't hurt that her fiancée is a handsome and sensitive doctor. Picard and his officers get into their dress uniforms to greet Deanna's wedding party, including her future husband (Wyatt), his parents, and Deanna's mother. Deann's mother is a full Betazoid, so she has powerful telepathic abilities.At the same time the Enterprise arrives at the planet Haven. Picard and his officers admire its immense beauty and legendary healing powers, but under a previous treaty Star Fleet must protect Haven from any external threats (since Haven has no defensive capabilities). The Enterprise detects a rare and dangerous Tarellian ship coming towards Haven, perhaps the last Tarellian ship in existence. If any Tarellians are on-board, then they are likely to carry a deadly plague (that has wiped out many populations and most Tarellians). So the Enterprise must ready itself for action.In general, ""Haven"" (Episode 10, Season 1, Air Date 11/30/87, Star-date 41294.5) includes a few interesting uses of holograms, humorous wedding details (between conflicting traditions), a look into the Tarellian history, and a strange view of consciousness.It also has a couple minor points about the Star Trek world: (1) Riker relaxes in his quarters and listens to a harp tune played by two little hologram women. (2) Wyatt's parents send a talking (robotic?) treasure chest to announce their arrival. (3) Data acts like a 'buzzard' watching social interactions at the wedding events, and he urges the wedding guests to continue their 'petty bickering'. (4) Dr. Crusher is made to question the sanity of humanoid forms as she reflects on past Tarellian caused plagues. (5) You can't beam out of a ship if its under a tractor beam (not sure why). (6) Neat: Data infers that the Tarellian ship is receiving its message to them because 'our sensors are showing a responding echo on the frequency they once used' (in this type of episode, you really have to look down deep for any SF!).The most interesting idea in the episode revolves around human duality: we think one thing and often say something different. But the Betazoids can communicate through thoughts (telepathically) so they cannot think anything differently from what they thought-say.Are Betazoids therefore strictly honest all the time? Perhaps not, for they could still train their mind to stop thinking certain thoughts, so every time a certain chain of thoughts begin, they could practice 'thought stopping'. Some clinical psychologists teach their patients this technique today in our world (my abnormal psychology professor mentioned this).Plus, humans cannot read minds, so Betazoids could lie to humans all they want. Lwaxana (Deanna's mother) perhaps lies to Picard (or teases him) about him having 'such thoughts' about her as she leaves (but maybe it's true).I found Picard's gripe about Betazoid traditions interesting. He thinks their traditions conflict with the 24th Century world, probably referring to marriage arrangements at childhood. And he would probably argue that in the 24th Century we tend to treat people as sentient beings worthy of making many of their own decisions. Usually Star Trek is very culturally liberal, but perhaps some cultural traditions strike against its values so much it decides it must take a stand.And now the idea I found strangest. Wyatt dreams about a Tarellian women, who he mistakingly thinks is his wife (Deanna) projecting her thoughts into his mind. Lwaxana tells Wyatt (while answering his question of how the Tarellian reached him from so far away) that all life and consciousness are 'bound together' and are both 'part of the same thing'. All lifeforms can project their thoughts, get lucky, and contact other people across the universe who they've never met.This could be the recurrence of panpsychism, which states that all things in nature are intelligent. The idea is mainly in 'Traveler' episodes, such as Episode 5 & Episode 171 ('Where No One Has Gone Before' & 'Journey's End'). But panpsychism isn't a very convincing idea in itself and has zero scientific evidence.It's a bit different this time. It applies to all life and consciousness instead of the fabric of reality itself, but it still leads to absurd and mysterious thought powers: this time thoughts can travel across the universe and impact the mind of another sentient being. (In the previous episodes it gave the Traveler powers over space-time, propulsion, and more.)But the idea itself certainly doesn't imply any powers of distant communications by thoughts and dream image inducements. As far as we know, that part of the argument is pure magic and doesn't follow logically from panpsychism. Thoughts are still local and limited to their physical embodiment, even if all life and consciousness is bound together by a common substance or principle. The episode needs to invent another principle in addition to the ones they suggest to help empower thoughts so dramatically (like inventing thought as a mysterious nonphysical type of entity that has infinite range like gravity; we would have detected it probably in a lab if it was a physical substance).Perhaps Star Trek is getting back at science for killing its ability to use ESP themes and present them as legitimate scientific possibilities as it did in the original series in one episode (Episode 3: ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" in 1966). 'Well if I can't use that, I'll use panpsychism from metaphysicians like David Chalmers'! Or maybe they imagined their idea of consciousness in such an extreme way just to prevent science from ever proving it right or wrong!This episode doesn't have that much substance in its SF elements and seems intended more for lightness, humor, and character development.",

She is not a full Betazoid (sort of like Mr. Spock's half-Vulcan). When Lwaxana, Deanna's mother, shows up (a great Scrabble word) she is a tiresome, overbearing woman. Deanna, as part of a culture that endorses it, has an arranged marriage and her mother is here with her fiancé to make sure everything goes as it should. When he sees his ""beloved"" he is stunned. He has been dreaming of someone else. Now the more interesting story. A doomed group of Terrelians is wandering the galaxy, trying to find safe haven (at Haven, of course).

The solution to this tale is interesting. While many find Lwaxana a refreshing change, I found her an intergalactic stereotypical Jewish mother. Of course, we haven't seen the last of her.",6

Troi is engaged to an Earth couples' son, a medical doctor named Wyatt Miller. Troi reluctantly agreed to the marriage since it is part of Betazoid tradition. Riker is upset by all this. The marriage is supposed to take place aboard the Enterprise in a few days once the guests have arrived.Meanwhile, the Enterprise is orbiting a planet known as Haven, a beautiful planet so renowned for its surface that many believe it contains healing powers. An unidentified ship is soon seen approaching the planet at sub-warp speed. It is revealed to be a ship full of humanoid refugees, possibly the last ship of it's kind from a planet where the citizens tore each other apart with biological warfare. Every ship is a possible disease carrier and Haven refuses to allow the ship to land on the planet's surfaceThe Enterprise puts the ship in its tractor beam and make video contact. Wyatt sees the survivors on the ship and recognizes one of the woman as a woman he's had dreams about since he was a child. He secretly beams over to the ship to meet her while also trying to help the survivors find a cure. He'll never be able to return or marry Troi but this is his destiny and he is content. The wedding party leaves and the Enterprise takes off for its next mission with Troi still aboard.Sometimes an episode can be bad yet still entertaining and that's kind of how I feel about this one. Troi's mother is an unbearable character yet still a but amusing in small doses. I find the scenes where the two talk telepathically together pretty hilarious. Also Mr. Homn throwing back alcohol and hanging out with Data is pretty great.There's not really a whole lot that happens in this episode. We learn a bit more about Betazoids. Since they're a new culture to the Star Trek universe, it's nice to have at least a little background to their race.Riker pouting around the ship the whole time is also pretty great. He's had his chances with Troi yet isn't dating her so why's he acting like Troi betrayed him?As entertaining as I found this whole thing, it's still not a good episode. Some of the comedy hits, some of it is unintentional, and some just falls flat. The story doesn't really go anywhere and no deeper meaning is ever really conveyed.",2
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Haven (TV Episode 1987)",more than anything.. anything in the world..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 01A promising start for the series, where cases may come and go, but the chemistry among the cast is what amps up the charge, with background still kept under the shades and just skimming off the surface of their equations, the makers have managed to tease us and hook us from the first adventure itself.HavenTo pull out a dinner table conversation gone wrong case in a series like such shows the bold decisions that writers go for, and even though it over chews the emotions, this fresh script is rebooting the series in a way we never thought of.",

It's also the first episode to really go in depth into what the holodeck can do (although seen in two episodes before this including the pilot episode ""Encounter At Farpoint) - in this case, you see Picard playing what will become his favorite character, that of 1940s detective Dixon Hill in many episodes (and this character will have a welcome cameo in the feature film Star Trek: First Contact). Also, the part at the beginning where Troi teaches Picard the exact greeting at beginning of film to say to an alien species, is just like in the feature film Star Trek: Insurrection (also at the beginning when Picard is coached by Troi when he is about to meet the new alien delegates).

1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Big Goodbye (TV Episode 1988)",Star Trek Noir,"""The big goodbye"" introduces us to the first holodeck adventure, in this case Captain Picard posing as private investigator Dixon Hill. This episodes creates some sort of standard pattern, repeated several times on TNG as well as DS 9 and Voyager. After entering the holodeck something goes wrong and the characters have to deal with the program under different circumstances beyond playing a game (represented by the failure of the holodeck's safety program). This concept is used to expand Star Trek's possibility and enabling a kind of genre-mix. Picard's Dixon Hill stories are examples of 1940s crime fiction and their representation on the screen are referred to as Film Noir often having the stereotype antihero in the lead (see for example Chandler's Marlowe stories or Polanski's all time classic ""Chinatown""). Star Trek never focuses on the story (mostly it's a simple ""how-do-we-get-out-of-here"" scenario) but enables the actors to take a different approach to their characters. Those Holodeck ""games"" are commonly used for recreation and reflect the private interests of the crew members. Therefore the technical aspect is always neglected and from that point of view the stories are never sound (but did Star Trek ever had a technical, scientific point to it, I mean besides some utopic concepts?).""The big goodbye"" shows a relaxed Patrick Stewart, a McFadden that hardly ever looked better in a Star Trek episode (at least the early ones) and Data has some great scenes, too (although I find it hard to believe that pulling the lamp's plug out of the wall would have really surprised him, for the fact that he'd done research on that period and its customs). Wesley continues turning peaceful Trekkies into potential murderers (why didn't they take him to the holodeck and let the gangsters finish him off?) but all in all this one's fun...",7

I guess if we can accept warp drive and all its implications, we can also accept a programmed fantasy room. I don't recall ever hearing even a theory of how this thing works and how individuals can program it to live their every wish. One can only imagine what sorts of programs one with a little bit of a jaded imagination could cook up. It certainly allows for some interesting avocations as well as being a practical tool. In this episode, Picard ends up trapped in the Holodeck as he tries to relax during intense negotiations with an insect-like race. The thing flat out malfunctions, leaving him unable to escape from a 1940's gangster program (in the Sam Spade tradition). Data and Wesley are given the task of figuring out what is going on.

4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Big Goodbye (TV Episode 1988)",TNG's Take on Noir,"In ""The Big Goodbye"" the Enterprise is en route for a diplomatic mission to make contact with an insectoid race that has previously had issues with the Federation. This race is know to be touchy regarding their customs and language so Picard must study up on what to do and say.To give his mind a break from his rigorous studies, Troi suggests Picard spend some time in the holodeck. It has recently received a few upgrades and Picard is excited to test it out. He chooses the time period of Dixon Hill, a noir-era San Francisco private eye. He brings Data, Crusher, and the ship's historian along with him as well.A pervasive scan of the Enterprise by the Jarada race causes the holodeck to malfunction. Not only can the bridge no longer contact the holodeck inhabitants, but they can't find them inside to beam them out nor can they break open the doors. Inside, the crew members are caught up in some kind of noir plot. Picard is interrogated by the cops. Back in Dixon's office, the crew is accosted by a mafioso who thinks Dixon has something he's looking for. The historian is shot and starts to actually die. The doors won't even appear for them to escape. Meanwhile on the outside, Geordi and Wesley try to reboot the system while Riker stalls for the Jarada.In the end, Picard & Co. are able to escape the holodeck after the mafioso tries to leave the holodeck for the hallway of the Enterprise and fades away into nothing. Picard's interaction with the Jarada goes smoothly and everyone cheers.Holodeck episodes are always a bit clunky. So many weird coincidences and happenstances must occur for the stakes to be high. Here the holodeck gets so jacked up that the crew outside can't even figure out where Picard is to beam him out. They also can't open the doors manually without risking the chance that everything inside will revert to the atomic level.All this is highly convenient for the plot of this episode to remain in the noir-era holodeck. Meanwhile outside, Riker and the rest of the bridge crew basically twiddle their thumbs and wait for engineering to figure it out. It's also convenient that the Jarada refuse to talk to anyone but the captain, causing a ticking clock on how long the Enterprise can go without the captain.So yes, the plot here is a bit if a problem but the episode still has its moments. I love noir movies and books so a genre-crossing episode like this is right up my alley. I probably like this episode more than I should. My favorite scene was where Picard and Data are absolutely charmed by the henchman who threatens to shoot them, not yet realizing the gravity of their situation.This is the first episode where we really play around with the holodeck for a good chunk of the runtime. The bridge crew doesn't really have a lot to do while their captain is stuck in there. That's unfortunate. I think a better secondary plot could have really beefe this episode up. A nice space battle that Riker must command while his captain's away could have been just what the doctor ordered.Still, not a terrible episode. It's a nice change of pace from the standard episodes of Season 1.",6
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Big Goodbye (TV Episode 1988)",The Big Goodbye,"Fun diversion from the norm allows the Picard character to have some much deserved fun as he uses the Holodeck to recreate a 40s crime detective hero, Dixon Hill, while the Enterprise is on a course to rendezvous with a class of aliens with a unique language. This species expects the greeting from their visitor's top ranking officer to be pronounced perfectly without a single syllable out of place. Their scan of the Enterprise, a surprise Commander Riker and the crew weren't expecting, causes the Holodeck Picard, historian Whalen, Data, and Dr. Crusher are in to malfunction, leaving them trapped in the program. Even worse, Dixon's arch nemesis, criminal kingpin, Cyrus Redblock (the perfectly cast Lawrence Tierney) demands to know where his special object of substantial worth is located (a homage to the Maltese Falcon), showing up uninvited and at the most inopportune time for the Captain. Cyrus Redblock's trigger-happy gunsel, Felix Leech (Harvey Jason, with a voice mimicking Peter Lorre) shoots Whalen (David Selburg), and the bullet is real enough to cause massive internal bleeding. Redblock promises to shoot Beverly Crusher if Dixon doesn't give him what he's after. Picard, thinking on his feet, might have another proposition, by trying to convince Redblock that he's actually from another time and place! While Picard and company are stranded in the Holodeck program, Wesley and Geordi attempt to locate the malfunction within the computer and fix it so that it releases them. Cyrus and Felix desire to visit Picard's world, not knowing what's in store for them. ""The Big Goodbye"" is a Holodeck-themed episode that gives us a tour of all it can do; this episode establishes the breakthroughs in the Holodeck technology, with Picard jovial and enthusiastically informing his Bridge crew of its many wonders. This is also an episode that lets us return to a former world, certainly of fiction, yet including real things quite alien to the Enterprise crew members who trip to the Dixon Hill era of American life. Relics to them (cars, talks of baseball, newspapers, wardrobe of that particular period, the lingo, etc.), are brought to life, the 40s period beautifully presented for our amusement. The outside Enterprise drama, a rush against time before the Enterprise meets the rendezvous point, is less important even though the episode tries to build suspense in Picard's absence within the Holodeck. Seeing Picard (and, especially Data) interact with 40s caricatures is quite funny (such as Data's speaking of DiMaggio's streak ending to the Indians as newspaper salesman Dick Miller (!) scoffs at such crazy talk (Miller delivers those lines as only he can; a cameo quite inspired and memorable), and this episode is certain to be an audience-pleaser much in the same fashion as the Sherlock Holmes-themed episode ""Elementary, My Dear Data.""",7
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Big Goodbye (TV Episode 1988)",Not the holodeck!!!,"While I am sure that holodeck episodes of ""Star Trek: The Next Gereration"" were pretty popular (since they repeated this gimmick in many episodes of ""Deep Space 9""), I always hated them as they never really seemed to fit in with the other shows and seemed very contrived. Some, like this one, were bad--and some were horrible (such as the Moriarty and baseball team episodes in both shows). Picard is supposed to do some complicated diplomatic mission with some annoying insect people. The problem is that a holodeck malfunction keeps him trapped with a few other cast members in a pulp fiction novel. In many ways it's like a Raymond Chandler novel--which has ZERO to do with a sci-fi show! Some people might have enjoyed it--I would much rather see film noir OR sci-fi--not both at the same time. Pretty dumb and unfortunately the first of many.By the way, if you do watch, note Laurence Tierney as the heavy and Dick Miller as a newspaper salesman.",3

But as cynical as that sounds, I'm sure this was pretty cool back in '88 before it became (almost) groan-inducing. And really, it's one of the reasons I dig the Enterprise-D. the wish-fulfillment possibilities are endless.Anyhoo, stressed out while prepping for a diplomatic mission, Jean-Luc uses the holodeck to disappear into a detective novel; which means trading in a starship set for a dingy P.I. office, period suits (which everyone wears the hell out of) and '40s cliché dialogue. Naturally, the computer wigs out, a man is shot with no access to sickbay, and in walks the big bad guy (Lawrence Tierney, lending his signature terrifying toughness to the show).Despite the mild silliness and the completely uneven pacing, I do like this episode. The pulp environment is a fun one and it does give Data an opportunity to overdo the period mannerisms while Dr. Crusher tries to blend in as a dame. And it's kinda nice to see Picard get really excited about something.7/10",7
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Big Goodbye (TV Episode 1988)",Invasion of the English Student!,"'The Big Goodbye' emphasizes a detective story more so than any of its embeddings in the Star Trek world. It has dark humor, good acting, subtlety, and interesting character development. It unluckily aired after three mediocre episodes, so it gets on my nerves with its lack of SF and tangential storyline going into the 'rabbit hole' far away from Star Trek. I liked the detective story for its own sake since I'm a huge 'Maltese Falcon' and film noir fan. The dark humor is witty: 'oh I'd like to be interrogated under the lights; why does he get to have all the fun' (from Dr. Crusher; these are my favorite types of lines in the episode).The plot: Picard's next mission is to try to initiate diplomatic relations with the Jarada, a touchy and formal race that requires a precise greeting given in their language. If the Captain makes the slightest error, then the Jarada will take offense and refuse any further diplomatic negotiations.But Dr. Crusher recommends to Picard that he take his mind off perfecting the difficult greeting. He likes the idea and decides to go play make-believe in the holodeck room, using his favorite Dixon Hill reality hologram program. During his game, the Jarada scan the ship and create a series of malfunctions that lock the Captain in a Holodeck room -- allowing him to use most of the episode playing Dixon Hill.So my take on ""The Big Goodbye"" (Episode 11, Season 1, Air Date 01/11/88, Star-date 41997.7) is that it misuses Star Trek themes to essentially employ a detective story for most of the episode, giving it an odd invasive quality into the personal time of the characters.I noticed a few things of interest to me and the Star Trek world:(1) Picard notes that the Holodeck is often used for crew training and relaxation. I'd rather see crew training and SF, and not personal Captain play time.(2) I noticed the limited way in which Data learned all of the Dixon Hill stories; he had the computer spin through all the pages. We also see his brother learn from the ship library in the next episode, 'Datalore', in a similar way. So Data apparently doesn't have all of the ship's library of information already in his neural net and he doesn't have Internet-type connections to the ship computer library.(3) I also noted that a fake bullet caused real blood to flow from a ship historian (Mr. Whalen). I don't buy that a hologram bullet could puncture skin, so this goes to show that much of the ""hologram deck"" is actually a recreated world of physical characters and substance (perhaps programmed and designed from teleport and food dispensing type technology). It seems they violate the disconnect from holograms and physical people, so it's not really much of a hologram room at all: it's a teleport/materialization room (with a little hologram technology around the edges)! If so, how could a computer control safety settings and prevent a metal bullet from harming you? Does it usually create Styrofoam bullets?But I'd rather Star Trek stories arise more naturally and through the context of the Star Trek world, and not from out of context reasons, such as 'let's do a western', 'lets toss in Sherlock Holmes', 'let's do a film noir theme'. Sometimes the holodeck really works, as in '11001001', but sometimes it just allows the writers a way to seemingly broaden the appeal of the show and turn it into a side quest or a short film festival.I wish the Enterprise crew would spend their personal time in the holodeck in private and didn't allow us to spy on them; if NASA did this it would bring shame and dishonor on science, civilization, and common decency. Sometimes the holodeck side quests really work, if they have strong SF elements. But this episode was more like a week off Star Trek for me, as if an English student took over the show!",

0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Datalore (TV Episode 1988)",First horribly scripted episode of the series.,"After reading a few of the other reviews here, it came to my attention that none of them mentioned the faults that I think ruined this episode. The episode reminded me of current, bad horror films in which the characters are so stupid that it seems that they have no brain to think with.I enjoyed this episode greatly up to the point where Lore disguises himself as Data; the initial search on the planet and the interesting story behind Data and Lore was enjoyable and interesting to watch.However, the irrationality of the crew (particularly Picard) lacked consistency with their normal behaviour. After Wesley suggested that Lore might be disguising himself as Data, Picard seemed furious at Wesley's disrespect in talking to a senior officer. That by itself seems quite normal of Picard, but the failure to even consider in the slightest the possibility truth in Wesley's warning does not make any sense. Perhaps if Wesley was a troublemaker ""boy who cries wolf"" character, I might forgive Picard's overlook; but the fact that Wesley has only ever shown complete devotion to the ship combined with his obvious intelligence gives no rational reasoning behind Picard.With any reasonable thinking, we realize that the simple inspection of Lore's body to confirm that it is Lore and not Data far outweighs the potential security risks of letting Data, who may be Lore, wander the ship freely without question. Yet, this inspection does not occur until far later when Wesley and his mother are kicked off the bridge rudely by Picard.""Shut up Wesley!"" yells Picard after Wesley suggests the possibility of a security breach. Is it not part of any star fleet officer's duty to report such possibilities? Picard even makes this sort of claim earlier in the episode to the security chief!I do not buy the idea that Wesley was not listened to because of his age - even if the crew and Picard were so ignorant to his repeated proofs of his ability, the potential security risk could not be ignored in any rational mind.To top off the episode with annoyance, Wesley and his mother follow Data to confront Lore at the end. While I openly consider the possibility that there was no time to call the security team, I still find it far fetched and silly. And if that was the case, how does Picard and Ryker and Tasha Yar come in afterwards ready to fight before any other security guard!?Otherwise, the episode was well done including Data and Lore's superb acting, so I give this episode a 6/10 rather than 3/10.",4

Data, however, is just as interested in learning to sneeze as he is about investigating his potential home world. The 'away team' finds very few signs of life on the planet, but Geordi notices a hidden door that leads to a secret cybernetics lab.The main twist of ""Datalore"" (Episode 12, Season 1, Air Date 01/18/88, Star-date 41242.4) concerns the discovery of Data's evil twin android or 'brother', named Lore, found in the lab where Data was made. Then it nicely weaves together Lore's future plans and his immediate desire to feed the Enterprise crew to a giant crystalline entity.Lore dismisses Data's climb as an officer and history at Star Fleet Academy as 'a system designed to compensate for limited human ability' and as a sign of Data's sheepish commitment to think like a mere human.In contrast Lore mentions his ultimate goal of assimilating the knowledge of 'thousands or millions of humans' or the knowledge of 'hundreds of millions of lifeforms of every kind' into his positronic brain. He wants to maximize his potential! His quest is just like the goal of the Borg, so this could be argued to be the first 'Borg'-themed episode (though no Borg are in it).Lore knocks out Data with a devious trick in order to call the crystalline entity into action against the Enterprise. Lore then pretends to be Data, but Wesley seems to notice and Picard notices too when Lore fails to understand Picard's recurring phrase 'make it so'. There were other signs too, such as ""Lore"" (acting as Data) accidentally blabbing about the existence of android 'shut off' switches -- which is supposed to be a secret.Here are more of my favorite gems:(1) I love the initial exploration of Dr. Noonien Soong's cybernetics lab. We get an excellent back story to Soong and it sets a cool 'lab experiment' ambiance throughout the episode. Soong is close to a mad scientist type character, which is fully true in the failed creation of Lore (the rejected first successful attempt at making a positronic brain). Lore is not to be trusted and seems sarcastic as he comments about the colonists fear of his all-too-human characteristics, but perhaps the colonists actually saw him exhibiting some of the enjoyably devilish human qualities like deceit!Soong had failed several times to make a 'positronic brain', a term coined by Isaac Asimov (explicitly referred to in the episode, and it's true). Lore's nickname for him is 'often wrong' (a joke Data fails to get). Dr. Soong had promised many advancements on the positronic brain, but he failed to deliver most of them. Most in the scientific community thought he gave up on the possibility of its success. But Soong went to a far off colony (Omicron Theta) to continue his work in a secret underground lab. This back story seems like something right out of a Michael Crichton novel, with the exception of scale. Crichton's novel 'Jurassic Park' gave the private and elusive scientists many more resources through business backing. The episode seems to underestimate the scale of resources needed to create an android, and it fails to comment on the specialization of technical skills. It also has the chief engineer of Enterprise put Lore back together again, but perhaps it's simple to figure out such connections by comparison and contrast to Data.And on re-watching parts of the episode, I wondered whether the colonizers could have helped Dr. Soong create Lore/Data. Data says the 'principle interest' of the colony was 'science'.(2) Picard and his crew discuss the possible reasons behind the creation of androids: to make humans feel more comfortable around machines and to allow scientists to prove they could create a machine that wasn't pathetically clumsy.(3) Picard assures his officers that it's fine to openly discuss the awkward machine nature of Data/Lore. Picard makes the argument that humans are a kind of electrochemical machine, so it's acceptable to refer to Data/Lore as machines of a different sort. This comes back in a major way in Season 2's 'Measure of a Man' episode.(4) We hear that Data was given the memories of 411 fellow colonists. But Data only has their knowledge. He lacks certain types of experiences and other 'basic human information', such as using contractions, understanding sneezing and emotions (such as knowing how the word 'sweet' applies in the phrase 'home sweet home'), whistling ('Encounter at Farpoint'), succeeding with humor (especially in 'Code of Honor'), defeating finger traps ('The Last Outpost'), or understanding social interactions and petty bickering (especially in 'Haven').(5) Lore bests Data in many human traits. Lore can use contractions and he understands humor. Yes, he is much more 'human' in the broad range of human qualities than poor Data, who worries if there's even a chance he might be interpreted as boasting ('The Naked Now').For example, Lore (a) engages in deception to make humans feel comfortable around him (pretending to not quite remember a simple deduction from the Pythagorean theorem, and lying about being built first), (b) he masters sinister backstabbing and conspiracy for mass murder (communicating with the crystalline entity to help entice it consume all the colonists on Omicron Theta in revenge for their rejection of him), and (c) he has grand goals for assimilating massive amounts of knowledge (like the Borg).I think Data is one of the greatest of all Star Trek creations (right there with Kirk/Picard, the Vulcans, the Klingons, and the Borg), and he constantly gives this series fertile creative material. Brent Spiner's acting (as Data/Lore) was top notch in every way. That guy has an extreme devotion to the character. It never ceases to amaze me how faithful he tries to remain to the character's android heritage!",
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Datalore (TV Episode 1988)",Evil twin,"This episode demonstrated just how good Brent Spiner is and how much of an asset he would be to the show. Brent really flexed his acting abilities in this and presented a interesting peep into Data's past. If a little too secretive! But this is all cleared up later in the coming seasons. Several direct lifts were taken from a Star Trek episode too, 'The Enemy Within', where Kirk is split in two by the transporter, whilst the other Kirk has scratches on his face, Lore has a twitch on his. Not too many similarities though as this would be boring. Wesley's involvement in the story was interesting and created a 'let's listen to the kid too' scenario and the crew developed a bit of respect for him from here on. The episode sets up a long running story which continues right through the fourth season to the seventh. Lore demanded to return after this..........!",10

Dr. Soong's underground lab is found, meaning we're in for some Data backstory. Cue the intro of Lore, about as close to a brother there can be. Except it turns out he's a bad guy. Brent Spiner owns in this; it's an opportunity for him to stretch his legs. He plays each one completely differently - one naive, the other conniving. There's even a brawl in the cargo bay, straight out of The Original Series. The doubles used while a sole actor has to be in two places at once is surprisingly effective.And then - seemingly out of nowhere - everyone gangs up on Wesley. now on one hand, I finally get to see the origin of the ""Shut up, Wesley!"" meme, but everyone just sort of goes full-on dick toward him. It's a weird scene, especially since he has a very valid point.And Lore's turn from curiosity to villain is just a tad forced, but overall, these are just a few bumps in an otherwise well-paved road.7/10",7
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Datalore (TV Episode 1988)",The Other Side of Data,"This is an intense episode. We find out about Dr. Soon (Data's creator), Lore (his evil ""brother), and the crystalline entity which, like the Borg, will make its presence known again. In this one, a trip to a planet that was once a center of agricultural is explored. It has become dead and rocky. This is the birthplace of Commander Data and upon investigation, a nearly perfect copy of Data is found. Upon resurrecting this fellow, it turns out that it is Lore, who somehow has developed an evil streak. He is probably responsible for the destruction of an entire civilization. He has hooked up with a beautiful space traveler, the crystalline entity. This thing, when it comes in contact with living creatures, destroys them. Through deception, once back on his feet, Lore disables Data and begins his plan to feed the Enterprise to the entity. Wesley Crusher has suspicions, but no one will listen to him. While there are a lot of plot holes, it is a really important part of the oeuvre. Data is really featured here and it sets up some wonderful possibilities for the future.",8

An old farming colony, the planet's surface is now barren and uninhabitable. The away team discovers an abandoned underground base where an unassembled Data clone is sitting in storage.They crew decides to take it aboard and try to put it together. After turning it on, we learn that this clone is named Lore and both robots were built by the infamous Dr. Soong. Lore reveals that the original colony was consumed by a giant crystalline being that fed off of their energy. The crew starts showing Lore around the ship. It's clear to audience members that there's something off about this Lore character.At one point Lore poisons his brother Data and turns him off, assuming Data's identity and ship role. He reveals to Data in a monologue that he's friends with this crystalline being and plans to feed the ship's crew to it once it drops the shields. He sends a message to this being which then quickly pursues the Enterprise.Lore (masquerading as Data) talks to the being and plans to drop the shields when teleporting something off of the Enterprise. But Wesley and Crusher have their suspicions about Data and have turned back on the real one. Data and the two Crushers pursue Lore and fight it out with him. Data tosses Lore onto the transporter and Wesley sends him out into space. With Data redeemed, the crew head back on their original flight path.This is the best TNH episode we've had this far in Season 1. It starts off really strong with the introduction of Data's back story and an evil twin plot line. The third act gets a bit messy but I think Spiner does a great job of juxtaposing the two roles and giving them unique identities. I also enjoy the fight scene where they're just flinging giant (supposedly) heavy barrels back and forth off of one another.There's also something so satisfying about hearing people tell Wesley to shut up. (Let's ignore the fact that he's totally right in this instance.)There's not really a subplot here which makes this episode extremely focused on its one storyline. Data is one of my favorite TNG characters so any episode where we get TWO of him is okay in my book.",7

Here, the new series finds a duplicate version of Data and when they assemble it, they slow come to realize that although he looks like Data, he's rather evil. In the meantime, they slowly learn that there are some other differences--as Lore is emotional, tricky and speaks with contractions. The whole evil and enemy of mankind part only comes out later. Will it be too late? Tune in and see.""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" actually made several Lore episodes and this is just the first. All of them were awfully good--mostly because it was nice to see a jerk version of Data! Normally Data was so nice and cute- -but Lore is just a nasty butt-head! A welcome bit of comedy and something that make him a very enjoyable recurring character--mostly because evil is much more interesting than nice. And, considering he tries killing all the crew, that is a pretty definite indication of not-niceness!!Aside from the crew being a bit dumb during parts of the episode, this is an excellent show.

9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Datalore (TV Episode 1988)",Datalore,"Visiting Data's homeworld, The Enterprise away team, Commander Riker, Data, Geordi, Worf, and Yar find the laboratory of a robotics genius named Dr. Noonian Soong whose goal to develop a positronic brain was a failure. Vanishing from Earth, the lab where he constructed Data, another android is discovered, in pieces, and the homeworld is left lifeless, once a colony of scientific minds and plenty of farmland. Once reassembled on the Enterprise, this android, who calls himself Lore, was made with human qualities, but he ultimately turns out to be devious and cunning, with designs on leading a crystalline life form that was responsible for destroying all life on his and Data's planet, towards to Enterprise to ""consume"" all humanoid officers on board. Introduction to a *different* kind of android, quite a showcase for Brent Spiner who is free to show his dark side with Lore, including scenes where he mocks Data for being ""inferior"" due to his capabilities that are alien to the emotionless brother, even taking apart Worf with ease in a quick fight. What is also fun about this early first season episode is Acting Ensign Wesley Crusher's intuition that Lore, who slips something in a glass of champagne to immobilize Data as to substitute him, is not to be trusted and could have taking the Commander's place, with Captain Picard and Commander Riker both sore that he would speak to a senior officer in such a manner (he doesn't want to ""keep an eye on Data"" as Picard wishes, with Riker not pleased with Wes' conduct). When I was a kid, I always thought it was cool how they were able to have Spiner on screen as both Lore and Data, but especially neat is seeing Brent switch personalities, back and forth between each android. I have to imagine it was liberating for Spiner to really portray such an evil character, his face casting a sinister grin when contemplating all the horror he was preparing to unleash on an unsuspecting Enterprise crew. I thought the facial twitch Lore has was an interesting development, not to mention the way he uses can't or isn't unlike Data who is designed to say ""cannot"" or ""is not"". You just had to know that this story, including Data's ""father"", the whole origin of his existence, and Lore's, wouldn't end here. Data also having an ""off switch"", told to Beverly who will use this knowledge to help stop Lore later in the episode, is also established here.",7
10,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Datalore (TV Episode 1988)",aspects of your duplicate..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 01A promising start for the series, where cases may come and go, but the chemistry among the cast is what amps up the charge, with background still kept under the shades and just skimming off the surface of their equations, the makers have managed to tease us and hook us from the first adventure itself.DataloreAn exposure to oneself as an alter ego invades their ship creates a familiar seen-this-seen-that conflicts yet the result is completely entertaining if not a head scratching genius theme.",
0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Angel One (TV Episode 1988)","One of the reasons this show was so great, a great episode about trust and tolerance","First off, though I won't rant about it, I am really surprised at the poor rating and bad comments about Angel 1. For me it is a 10 out 10. The story is interesting here though secondary. What makes this episode so great is the interaction between the Star Trek officers. For the first time since the beginning of the show you feel the sense of companionship, trust and affection between the main characters. This episode is very well written and acted. It carries a lot of emotion, some of the scenes, though minimal, are amongst my favorite in the entire show. I was pleased to see Tasha and Troi seemingly jealous of Riker's interest for the female leader of the planet Angel 1; I laughed with them when they saw him dressed in half naked indigenous fashion, I was touched at Riker's final pitch and Mistress Beata reaction. Most of all I adored that little interaction between Geordie and Worf when the Klingon gave an advice to Geordie about how an acting captain should behave. And what about Data! The perfume scene is hilarious and Riker's trust in him in the final moments is touching. This episode has successively Geordie, Riker, Crusher and Data acting as acting captain. It characterizes what made this show so great: a vision of a team, a society whose members have absolute faith and trust in each other. Never the members of the Entreprise have an ill feeling about another, they do not get offended when one is temporally promoted above another, rather they support each other. They trust everyone's skills and have faith in each other. A few episodes before, upon meeting Q, Picard talked about the fact they the members of the Enterprise and their current society were superior humans to the ones that lives in the XXth Century. This episode, and others, is the perfect example of the superiority Picard is referring to. There is no animosity, ill rivalry, selfishness or ill feelings within the member of the Enterprise. They respect, tolerate and trust each other. As a manager of a team of 16 it will be my dream to have them respect and trust each other as the officers of the Enterprise do.",10

The theme of this episode is that change is inevitable - this is pointed out in the matriarchal society of Angel One (a non-Federation world) that the Enterprise crew travel to. While Riker leads an away team to negotiate the return of Federation survivors (all male), Picard and crew on the Enterprise mysteriously contract a virus that plagues the ship. It's up to Dr. Crusher to figure out what's going on and when Picard falls prey to the virus, Geordi LaForge is put in command of the Enterprise! An unremarkable episode but has its highlights and humor.",
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Angel One (TV Episode 1988)",Does Civilization 'Evolve' to a Necessary End?,"The Enterprise crew investigates the wreckage of a ship called the Odin and finds three missing escape pods. This brings them to the nearest class M planet, Angel One, in search of survivors. Angel One has scattered humanoid civilizations, which are currently at the level of advancement we were at in the 20th Century.The people of Angel One are a pure matriarchy, with women naturally taller and stronger than men and with social customs that only allow women to take positions of power. But while an 'away team' makes contact with the reticent oligarch (Mistress Beata), Wesley and a friend get sick after enjoying a ski-program on the Holodeck and their virus spreads uncontrolled through the ship. The Enterprise command must also hurry to respond to Romulan battle cruisers sited near the Neutral Zone.So ""Angel One"" (Episode 13, Season 1, Air Date 01/25/88, Star-date 41636.9) tries to keep our pulses pounding with many threads of emergencies and provocative events. The main controversy arises when the Angel One oligarchs (a six member council led by the Elected One named Mistress Beata) sentence Odin's survivors to death for inciting revolution. Geordi finds himself as acting commander after Picard catches the virus and is ruled unfit.Other minor plot points include: (1) The Angel One civilization is similar to Betazed in having female leaders; Worf comments that Klingons also like strong women. (2) Yar uses a tricorder to search for listening devices in an Angel One room (so the 'away team' can freely discuss their strategy). (3) Data doesn't understand how perfume acts as an aphrodisiac. (4) Riker expresses disregard for the prime directive and suggests he'd rather take the consequences than allow the Odin survivors to be executed. (5) Angel One seems a bit more advanced than we were in the 20th Century since they use a transporter like weapon to conduct executions.I'm not quite sure how the virus gets started, but apparently it had something to do with a sweet scent, commonly known to Klingons, which entices people to inhale and take in the virus.At the same time, Riker makes another attempt to convince Mistress Beata that she is wrong about executing the Odin survivors (after Dr. Crusher quarantines the ship and bans anyone from beaming up). Riker argues that she cannot stop the spread of revolution because it's spreading naturally. He compares the ideas of the rebels to 'evolution' and considers it unstoppable. I find Riker's argument one sided. It would benefit from the consideration of alternative possibilities, but, of course, Riker may be extra convincing to Mistress Beata since he just slept with her.Perhaps this extremely unconvincing argument is a version of Karl Marx's view that history has a direction and evolves to a more perfect condition (his view -- towards communism). But in this case the natural evolution would take Mistress Beata's people towards the values of Star Trek. I won't call this a conceited idea, but it seems based on zero evidence.But Riker is certainly correct that a martyr and that political issues can't be as easily killed as people. Though to reduce his whole argument to absurdity we could just point to the Borg, who could simply erase an issue they don't like and therefore easily advance to any new direction they want. So some civilizations in the Star Trek world obviously don't advance necessarily toward one end.The episode is a bit cute at times and it's obvious that a matriarchy is very possible for two gender lifeforms; we see it common throughout native history and the animal world here on earth. But otherwise the episode lacks anything of intense interest for me.",
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Angel One (TV Episode 1988)",Angel One,"""Martyrs cannot be silenced."" Angel One is a matriarchal planet where the women dominate over the men, and are in control of every facet of life. They rule in governmentand in the bed room. The planet's leader, Mistress Beata (Karen Montgomery), is strongly attracted to Commander Riker who, along with Yar, Troi, and Data, is attempting to locate survivors of a group on board a freighter, Odin, which suffered an asteroid collision, whose pods might have landed on Angel One. The episode also features a virus quickly infecting the Enterprise which actually might have started from Wesley and a friend, letting off a sickly sweet odor that produces flu-like symptoms when deeply inhaled. When Picard gets sick beyond the point of ably commanding the Enterprise, Geordi is left in charge (echoing the more awesome ""Arsenal of Freedom""). When Riker becomes sexually involved with Beata, Troi, Yar, and Data are unsuccessful in convincing the Odin party's leader, Ramsey (Sam Hennings), and his men, to leave with them so they can find a new home to livebut Ramsey and his men (who have developed families on Angel One) do not wish to leave. Beata sees no alternative but to execute the Odin group before their ways/philosophies becomes a hindrance to how Angel One has functioned as a society, their very way of life. Riker points out to Beata, in an effort to rescue Ramsey and his people from condemnation, that evolution eventually happens and executing them will not stop the inevitable. Meanwhile, Dr. Crusher works on finding an inoculation for the virus coursing at an exorbitant rate throughout the ship, not allowing Riker and the away team to beam back until she does. Also established is that The Romulans appear to be possibly on the verge of attacking Federation outposts along the Neutral Zone, needing the Enterprise to get there in the hopes that their presence will halt such possible violence. Interesting development has Beata's trusted ""number one"" married to Ramsey! I won't lie, this episode does nothing for me as a Next Gen fan, although it was cool seeing Data standing on the bridge all by himself as normal crew members are either in sick bay or their quarters, ill from the virus. The Angel One plot makes a statement about how any type of hierarchy, whether its male or female, as the dominate figurehead in ruling positions over the other, change is bound to happen as the oppressed/repressed are certain to revolt/rebel against such a way of life/political power. Riker, in more ways than one, uses his ""tactical skills"" to halt a potential disaster, that of unnecessary executions when a solution could be reached to not take human life. Captain's throat being affected by the virus at the end as he tries to tell the bridge to set a course for the Neutral Zone is, to me, the funniest scene in the episode. I consider this one of the worst of the first season; but the season has so many good ones, Angel One is probably quite an eyesore, unless the ""archy"" storyline is meaningful to you.",5

O.K., we get it, any ""---archy,"" matri- or patri- is bad. No need to belabor the point. But the show undermines its own premise by having the problem almost solved when Riker gets it on with the ruling female, Mistress Beata. In other words, as long as the guy is great in bed, nothing else matters. Shades of Captain Kirk. And, just to be clear, the actress playing Beata, Karen Montgomery, seems to have the acting skills and emotional range of a fourth-grader. Its no wonder then that, according to the IMDb, she's made only two other shows since this one. All in all, not one of ST:NG's better efforts.",4
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Angel One (TV Episode 1988)",Wow...such hate for this one...,"I did a bit of research on the internet about bad episodes of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" and found that just about every list included ""Angel I"". The reviews for it on IMDb are NOT very positive either. Apparently, it was truly cringe-worthy and Gates McFadden (the doctor) was truly offended by the sexist nature of the show and her fighting with the production staff got her suspended. What do I think? First, a little about the plot:Years ago, a freighter had an accident in space. No known survivors exist but an escape pod might have made it to a nearby planet, Angel I. Although it would have taken months to arrive, it could have and so the Enterprise is on hand to look for the men (though why so late, I have no idea). However, they are surprised that the matriarchal leaders of the society are less than cordial. It seems that the survivors DID arrive and they were a complete disruption to the old ways. The survivors balked at the sexist way the women treated the men...and wanted equality. So, the away team is told to find these renegade men and get rid of them immediately...or else! Plus, when they find the men, they find that these the men and their wives would rather die than leave!So did I find it that bad? Well, you do get to see Riker in drag--and that could be a plus or a minus depending on your desire to see him in a negligee-type thingie. And, the show has some things to say about gender equality---but in a ham-fisted manner (plus, the highest ranking folks on the ship are all men). In balance, it is weak but I don't understand all the hate--the series made LOTS of bad episodes (most of which centered around the holodreck...I mean holodeck). I wouldn't put it among the very worst...just one that is well below average and a tad cringe-inducing at times. And the biggest reason isn't the sexism but the ending--where everything is inexplicably wrapped up in a way that makes you think 'Hy...this makes no sense. Why did they do THAT?!'.",3

It is an insult to both male and female viewers. The story involves a planetary culture where women have become the dominant sex. The premise is fine. They are tall and powerful. The men are portrayed as glittery puppies who yield to the women. At its basest, it is just plain silly. Just because a single entity gains power doesn't mean they lose all their complexity. Also, they act and look just like earth creatures. They dominate men by using their feminine wiles, even though they reject these. I'm not sure if the men are victims or have evolved into idiots. The point is that there is nothing of any depth in this episode. Riker succumbs to the advances of the supreme leader. Apparently, he has qualities that the indigenous males don't have. The plot centers around a group of earth dwellers who have been marooned on this planet. Because they threaten the status quo they have gone underground (literally) to save their lives. In the process, they have created a subculture. The Enterprise crew is there to save them.

Unlike most people, we have found Deep Space Nine the most compelling. We find the most serious acting and writing defects in TNG. She has given up on it, but I am soldiering on. However, Angel One stands out as a nadir in television programming. I wont rehash what most people have already written about it.One of the conceits in the general ""Star Trek Universe"" is that planets aren't subdivided into countries. Angel One is supposed to be the equivalent to mid-20th century earth (the 50s), however the technology seemed even equivalent to the early 21st century. Politically, there seemed to be a single world leader, Beata, and everybody had easy access to her. This reminded me of TOS, and 50s science fiction movies, where limited budgets required world leaders to consist of councils of 3 men, sitting at a folding table with a ham radio and a table cloth draped over it.And, of course, this sophisticated world leader, ruler of millions, is dissuaded from long standing jurisprudence, codified through, I am sure, some sort of constitutional legal means, on the just punishment for treasonable acts, by a trite speech on evolution vs. revolution.

Angel One hasn't been visited by the Federation in 75 years and Data informs us it has a matriarchal society where women dominate and are larger than the men.Riker leads an away team down to meet the planet's leader. Everyone seems a bit cagey and put off by the crew's presence. There seems to be some sort of internal rift. We learn that the survivors of the Odin are here but are wanted fugitives, revolutionaries who tried to usurp the planet's law and order.The Enterprise's scanners are able to locate the Odin's crew and Troi, Yar, and Data meet the revolutionaries' leader. He tells them that they are happy on Angel One. They have families now and have no desire to leave. Because the Odin wasn't a Star Fleet vessel it isn't bound to the Prime Directive so the Enterprise can't force them to leave with them.Meanwhile Riker starts a love affair with the planet's leader and Crusher has her hands full with some kind of epidemic up on the Enterprise. Most of the crew is now infected and there are barely enough left healthy to operate the ship. To make matters worse, the Romulans are currently hovering near a Federation outpost nearby and the Enterprise has been called to show up and flex its muscles to make the Romulans leave.The Odin's crew and their families are discovered by Angel One's government and sentenced to death. Riker offers to take them with him but they prefer to go down as martyrs. Riker convinces the government to stay the execution by talking about the evolution of cultures and how to properly embrace this (or some BS like that). The government banishes the Odin families to a distant island where they can live peacefully but away from the current system.This episode's oversimplistic metaphor for society's norms screams of a TOS script that never got made. Replace Riker with Kirk and it feels like something you'd see in Season 3.Everything about this episode is sloppy. The set design is boring, the ""alien race"" they create here is extremely lazy, and the script seems like it was written by a high school freshman. The illness on the ship is created solely because the writers had no idea what to do with Picard and the rest of the remaining crew while the away team is in the surface. The final parlor scene is terrible and preachy as hell.I just can't find much that I enjoy here beyond the concept of a marooned escape pod crew having to adapt to a new society. It's so poorly done though that it wastes this premise. I did like Riker's native getup though. That outfit is iconic.",4

""11001001"" is one of my more favorite episodes of season 1 (and of the whole series) - it really gets to the heart of Star Trek and introduces a species that is quite different from humans - that of the Bynars who always travel in pairs since they need two to decipher their binary code (when interacting with each other and other beings). I really liked the beginning when the Enterprise docked at a Starbase, entering it (and exiting later on in the episode) just like the original Enterprise entering Spacedock in Star Trek III: The Search For Spock - though it's obvious they took the matte paintings from that movie, it is a welcome homage to The Next Generation's past.

I watched this episode the other night and it had everything; mystery, action, suspense, romance and character development. For an episode shot in the 1980s, it still holds up remarkably well in 2011.If you really sit down and analyze this episode, everything just came together and clicked which includes the directing, editing, acting, music score, camera-work, rhythm, pacing, special effects and story. It has great scale and a cinematic flare to it due in part to the very nice special effects, even if they are re-worked from Star Trek III.There are some subtle symbolic things I picked up on which may be coincidences. For example, at the end when Picard and Riker get up from the bridge computer station. They get up in exactly the same way and same time, much like how the bynars are paired up. I think this symbolized their interdependency much like the bynars depend on each other in pairs.The clever use of the holodeck, ship-wide evacuation and auto-destruct were well done. And I am glad they didn't do the clichéd thing about having the auto-destruct tick down until the final seconds. I think that shows maturity in the writing.

Data orders the crew evacuated because the ship is potentially explosive. Once everyone is off (except, of course, Riker and Picard) the ship leaves and goes into warp. It is now up to the two ranking officers to figure out what is happening and to remedy it. I won't spoil anything, but for the first time there is a story of real complexity, aliens that are very interesting, and a problem that could happen in this realm. The solution is quite satisfying. The other thing that works here is that the characters of the Captain and his Number One relax and show their human sides. Jean Luc in particular is probably a pretty lonely man, married to his ship. Like a brother in a monastery, everyone else comes first. Riker is a romantic and shows himself quite the smooth talker and we find that he has a great love of jazz and a penchant for the trombone.",8

The Bynars steal the Enterprise and use it's vast computer to restore their world. The crew wait anxiously back at the Starbase for their return.

I started to wonder how I could forget about such a terrific, exciting, and unique episode, featuring quite a fascinating group of computer-dependent aliens (who speak in binary language!) knows as the Bynars. For some reason the Bynars, who are assigned to boost the technological capacity of the Enterprise's sophisticated computer banks, ""gain access"" to the ship (more like commandeering the Enterprise), while Captain Picard and Commander Riker are on the Holodeck, with Lt. Commander Data and Lt. Geordi LaForge having evacuated the remaining crew (they could not contact Picard or Riker) due to the possible release of the Anti-matter in Engineering, certain to cause catastrophic results. How were the Bynars able to get Picard and Riker's attention during all of this..a very realistic, intuitive, and charming holographic brunette doll played by Carolyn McCormick (Law & Order), as Minuet, within a recreated New Orleans jazz club. With an emptied Enterprise, soon Picard and Riker decide to set Auto-Destruct and get to the Bridge, hoping to keep the Bynars from taking the Enterprise, discovering the four of them near death. It turns out that a supernova plays an important part, as well as, information stored on the Bynars world needing a place of temporary existence in the grand scheme of things, with Picard and Riker having to figure out how to save the aliens from complete extinction. Another scintillating parable about the dependency on technology and how that can lead to total annihilation, not to mention, seeing Riker and Picard working cohesively side-by-side to examine and avert a difficult situation. Riker is given a good brunt of the episode, and pretty early we see that this series was a bit more interested in developing their characters, showing him really responding intimately with Minuet who casts a spell on the commander. With the crew stuck on Starbase 74, it is neat spending time with just two people on board the Enterprise (the frustration of not being able to rescue Picard and Riker, and allowing the ship to be taken, is established well in Data's acceptance of responsibility (which is absurd, but understandable that he would ""feel"" this way) and Yar's multiple attempts to get a ship to catch up to them). I have a hard time not imagining this isn't a lot of fun for Next Gen fans. There's plenty of special effects eye candy such as the Enterprise docking at the visual dynamo of the Starbase and showing characters moving about inside the ship as it is docked. I think this will considered by some to be a sleeper episode, maybe found on many top 20 Next Gen fan lists.",8
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" 11001001 (TV Episode 1988)",A bit of Trivia,"I have to admit that, in general, Star Trek: TNG had left me a little cold, with sterile looking sets, a communist's idea of economic utopia, insults of national heritage (Ferengis described as Yankee Traders), and some occasionally peculiar morals concerning life and death.Sidestepping most of these problems is the episode 11001001: one of my few favorites. I'm not sure I liked the Bynars, themselves, who were little, androgynous, spooky-looking beings that walked around in pairs.I was mostly amused by the title: 11001001 is the binary value of the RET (Unconditional Return from Subroutine) Opcode for the 8080 and Z80 CPU. The Bynars wished their data ""returned"" after their shutdown.",
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" 11001001 (TV Episode 1988)",Can the Ones and Zeros of Binary Give Rise to Human-Like Complexity?,"The Enterprise arrives and docks at Starbase 74 for maintenance. The technicians on the maintenance team include two pairs of Bynars, an alien race from the planet Bynaus, who communicate with the ship computer much quicker than any human or (my guess) perhaps even Data.Though the Bynars have a secret mission to steal the Enterprise and save their home world.I thought ""11001001"" (Episode 14, Season 1, Air Date 01/01/88, Star-date 41365.9) was a perfect example of an episode's maximum use of the Star Trek world -- it contains an interesting new race, it motivates the new race with exciting SF possibilities that sound reasonable, and it fully embeds its holodeck scenes into the Star Trek world. It doesn't use the holodeck just to escape from the world of Star Trek ('The Big Goodbye'); it uses it to expand on interesting tech-no concepts.The Bynars work in teams of two (for customary reasons), but they have developed mental capacities as close to the binary language as is possible for biochemical organisms. The binary language is a language of ones and zeros, which are like on and off switches on a circuit board or similar to yes and no responses from a human.Computers translate all high level graphics and words we see on a computer monitor into the binary language of ones and zeros, so we might expect the Bynars to best communicate with computers since they naturally speak the same language (or very close to it).The advantages are clear: the Bynars speed up their communications with computers, and they can use buffers to store temporary information to allow them to handle massive amounts of information. The episode tries to get us to believe that the Bynars would have tremendous disadvantages too.Though the episode almost flies off its hinges of sanity when it has the Bynars mysteriously collapse and stop working. Apparently the Bynars stop functioning whenever their master computer (on Bynaus) stops functioning.This is a logical error of the largest sort since it ignores the individual nature of minds, even near-binary minds. Computers don't fail to function just because they lose Internet connections, for example. They just lose access to the wealth of information on the larger network. It would be similar to humans collapsing into a seizure after their central government decided to end its universal mandates and allow people to make their own choices!Perhaps the master computer on Bynaus powers the Bynars through some sort of power source left unexplained in the episode. But it would seem to me that they would get their power through eating food!In any case, the episode poses some of the most interesting sets of questions of season 1 so far.We learn that the Bynars made many enhancements to the holodeck. They mention this to Riker in the hopes of getting him to try out their enhancements (for reasons important to their plan, on which I'll keep quiet to avoid spoiling it). Riker decides to relax in the holodeck with a Jazz club program. He asks for an audience and eventually gets a beautiful women by the name of Minuet. As he and Picard study her, they find her all-too-human. (Picard walked in on Riker and her kissing.) She has dense human responses and characteristics that you don't normally find in holograms. She adapts to her environment and seems intuitive. Picard smartly points out that humans send out many subtle signs giving away their emotions and thoughts. Minuet seems to pick up on these, allowing her to have empathy with Riker and Picard.But sometimes she stares oddly off into space, so perhaps she's not quite there yet.The Bynars enhanced the holodeck and created Minuet. Her presence raises the question of whether computer programmers could realistically simulate human complexity. Can computer programming in ones and zeros give rise to complex behaviors? Could such computations combine to produce holograms that seem to have emotions, intuition, and intelligence?Minuet is even more advanced than Data in her humanity, so perhaps the Bynars are so highly advanced in their use of the binary language, they can program intelligent holograms and human complexity. (Most computers of today fail the 'Turing test' miserably, but Minuet seems apt to easily pass it in this episode.)Though Picard wonders whether Riker is falling in love with the illusion of Minuet more so than he would a real woman -- the illusion is sometimes more compelling than the person! This idea is just like the decision of Cypher in 'The Matrix' (1999) to choose simulated reality over the 'real world'. Though perhaps we also fall in love with our illusions of a person more so than the actual person all the time -- perhaps our minds are like a virtual reality environment, like a holodeck, in which we fall in love with 'virtual' illusions of things all the time.Analogously the episode poses similar questions to Data (and even Geordi with his tech-no visor). Could we tell the difference between the creativity of Data and the creativity of humans? Could a machine have creativity at all?We watch Data trying to learn to paint as an experiment in the possibility of android creativity (with Geordi encouraging him). But I'm not sure Data's neural net is quite as advanced as the Bynar near-binary minds. Probably not, for otherwise Data could just do the maintenance and prevent the Enterprise from stopping at Starbase 74.The Star Trek world comes to a high point in this episode. The holodeck is used to its SF fullest and all the tech-no elements in the series come together nicely -- the holodeck, Data, Geordi's visor, and the Bynars all contribute to thought provoking questions. Now I know why I became interested in Star Trek!",

The computers are updated by a pair of Binars, an alien race who are almost practically computers themselves. They constantly work in pairs and can communicate and store and transfer data at record speeds.Riker heads into a holodeck where he meets the woman of his dreams at an old New Orleans jazz bar. Even by holodeck standards, she seems too real to be true. Riker thinks it has something to do with the Binar's improvements.At some point it becomes apparent that something is wrong. The Binars trick everyone into fleeing the Enterprise when they think it's destined to overload and explode. Everyone leaves but Riker and Picard who are unaware inside the holodeck. The two try to overtake the ship and, once entering the bridge, discover 4 Binars on death's doorstep.Riker asks his holodeck dream girl what's going on and him and Picard learn that the Binars have loaded the sum of their races knowledge and data into the spare space of the Enterprise. An EMP caused by a star near their home planet going nova would have caused the computers to crash there, effectively killing the Binar race. The captain and Riker work together like Binars to re-download the information into the dormant Binars and back to the race's home planet, saving the race of computer-like aliens. The Binars apologize for all of this but didn't ask the Federation for help for fear of them saying no. Picard and Riker take back control of the ship and take it back to the star base to finish repairs.This episode is extremely hard for me to try to describe succinctly but I thought it was really well done in practice. I enjoy the presence of the little Binars and their black and white way of thinking. For them, only two options exist in life which is why they chose the actions they went with.This is a very Picard-Riker focused episode. Most of the other crew is basically written out of the plot with just a few scenes that don't really lead anywhere. That allows us to focus solely on the main storyline. Typically I like when TNG employs a B plot but here I think having just the one works out better. You could argue that the holodeck scenes are the B plot here but it all tied together rather smoothly so I'm counting it as one plot.This is my favorite TNG episode of the series thus far. It's got a neat little script, introduces a cool new alien series, and has some great character development for Number One.",7

In ""Conscience"", the governor has a giant black patch on his face--nice plastic surgery, huh? In ""Too Short a Season"", the admiral is elderly and is in a gigantic and klunky looking wheelchair sort of device. To top it off, the actor playing him is wearing some of the worst old man makeup I've ever seen--and he just looks ridiculous--as if they producers gave the makeup team the week off! Wouldn't you think that by the 24th century they might have advanced just a bit more?!This episode seems very contrived. An ambassador and his team have been taken hostage on a far away planet and for some inexplicable reason, the hostage-takers only seem to want an ancient a decrepit old admiral to negotiate with them. This makes no sense and why folks didn't balk at this is beyond me--and the writer didn't do a great job in setting this story line in motion. Regardless, on the way, the admiral undergoes an odd metamorphosis--becoming young again thanks to a miracle cure he's discovered. All this works together to produce a very weak show--one of the weakest of the first season. It's also VERY odd that Picard and the rest of the crew would go along with this nutty guy! And, Karnas' behavior at the end is just bizarre. However, it's NOT 100% terrible and is worth a look especially since the admiral's wife is played by Marsha Hunt---a 1940s actress who is always a delight to watch. And, incidentally, at age 96 she's still going strong and attended one of the recent Turner Classic Movies film festivals. Good luck to you Ms. Hunt!By the way, as the episode progressed towards a hostage rescue, I wondered WHY the Federation used such crappy and ineffective weapons!

And this is one of the many poor episodes from those early days. The series went on to much better things. Many of the the first season episodes were remakes. In this episode there is a lot of the over acting that plagued Star Trek. They were much better when they weren't trying to prove something. They have a young actor who thinks he knows how to portray an 85 year old man, but in fact he was just a caricature of an old man. And the cheesy make up didn't help either. It was obvious from the start that this was a young man who was some how going to over come his age. Needless to say the thing that reverses his aging fails he dies painfully as part of the story. This of course requires more over acting. And the usual carefully chosen moments in the story where all the technology that usually gets them out of trouble or cures all diseases can't safe the admiral. There's a really bad ""gun fight"" where the landing party, which always consists of the highest ranking members of the crew. Which seems foolish in any century. But their opponents in this fight where laser weapons are used are wearing plastic face shields. Definitely not one of this series better efforts.

4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Too Short a Season (TV Episode 1988)",Too Short a Season,"Captain Picard is to allow a crippled Admiral Mark Jameson (suffering from what is called Iverson's Disease) to take command of a hostage negotiation mission where a dangerous leader of one of the cities of a war-ravaged planet, Mordan IV, Karnas (Michael Pataki, full of sound and fury) claims that unless this specific mediator is present murder is certain. There's more to this than meets the eye and Karnas, in particular, could have hidden ulterior motives regarding Jameson, a possible revenge for a scandalous incident some 45 years ago. Karnas had demanded weapons provided to him due to his father ambassador's assassination at the hands of rival city, and what took place the day Jameson went to negotiate with him could not have been accurately conveyed to Starfleet. To deal with Karnas, Jameson has ingested a chemical compound that is causing his body to reverse in aging, his cell structure changing, but because he felt the need to take more than the required dose he has endangered his health. Intense pain and cell/organ failure result as the body continues to try to get younger and such stress is too much for Jameson to withstand. Such themes as the quest to recover youth, vitality, and strength and the seething desire for revenge are applied to this episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, ""Too Short a Season"". Neither produces positive results as Jameson and Karnas realize that such quests/desires are futile. While Karnas thought that seeing Jameson suffer for his role in 45 years of Civil War would be pleasurable, once this happens before his eyes it doesn't satiate or satisfy as he had assumed. If anything, it forces him to see the error of his ways and acknowledge that the price of that terrible day in the history of Mordan IV has been subjected on them in more ways than one. This episode includes a phaser fight between Jameson, Picard, and the Away team with Karnas' ground terrorists, as well as, Jameson's aging process, quite a shock to those on board the Enterprise, including his wife.",8
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Too Short a Season (TV Episode 1988)",Are People Free to Choose Their Own Destiny?,"The Enterprise receives a mission to negotiate the release of a Federation ambassador, who is held hostage. Governor Karnas, a faction leader on the planet Mordan IV, informs the Enterprise that a terrorist group took the ambassador hostage and demand Admiral Mark Jameson to come and conduct the negotiations.But Admiral Mark Jameson (who suffers from Iverson's Disease, leaving him confined to a wheel chair) decides he needs more youth and strength in order to succeed in his mission, so he takes an experimental and dangerous drug from Cerberus II. The Enterprise must see him safely to Mordan IV, keep him healthy, and cater to his rank. Admiral Jameson insists that he has command of the mission once they arrive at Mordan IV.So ""Too Short a Season"" (Episode 15, Season 1, Air Date 02/08/88, Star-date 41309.5) covers three threads of action: Admiral Jameson struggles with his 'miracle' drug, Star Fleet negotiates peace, and Picard ponders the causes of 45 years of war on Mordan IV. The prime directive comes back in an important but unique way.*Spoilers follow*This episode proves that Star Trek (TNG) doesn't always have its courageous crew overcome impossible odds; it *also* shows that those who try to overcome improbable odds through 'miracle' drugs succumb to negative side effects.Hubris against all odds is often important in Star Trek (TNG):(1) Star Trek (TNG) has a few episodes in which we see characters acting successfully and luckily against all odds, most notably in 'Encounter at Farpoint'.(2) Sometimes Star Trek (TNG) steps back with a rational perspective to calculate the odds, and it restrains its characters from action by the prime directive ('Code of Honor').(3) In 'The Last Outpost' Data notes that Star Fleet has often allowed civilizations to fall into slavery or succumb to mass death without moving a muscle.(4) But Picard ('Justice') and Riker ('Angel One') call the prime directive into question to differing degrees.In this case, Jameson weaponizes two factions on Mordan IV and sets off a chain of events leading to 45 years of war. (Jameson decided to give weapons to both major factions of Mordan IV to give each equal standing and help them come to peace, but it incites years of war.)Karnas wants revenge. He took the ambassador hostage himself just to summon Jameson to kill him for starting the 45 years of war. So revenge is central to its plot, as in 'The Battle'.Picard smartly argues that the two factions, including Karnas', could have chosen to settle peaceably by taking responsibility for their own actions. They have freewill to refuse to wage destructive warfare; they could have made another choice.So Karnas's desire for revenge shows how we may become blinded to the possibility of taking positive actions for ourselves to achieve our desired ends, or equally it shows how the decision of Jameson to re-interpret the prime directive can possibly contribute, if only a bit, to destructive ends.The most interesting part of this episode concerns the question of whether we should give dangerous technology to lesser advanced civilizations. But (Picard would say) even if we do and bad side effects follow, advanced civilizations don't completely control the outcomes of other people; people are free to make different decisions and must take much responsibility for their own actions.So this episode has an excellent moral point of view. It says sentient beings are free to act, people must take responsibility for their actions, and it's wrong to 'play the victim' and place all the blame for one's suffering on an outsider.I give top marks to this moral message, but the episode could use more SF!",

The hostages are the Federation's ambassadors to said planet.As the Enterprise gets closer to the planet, Jameson appears to be getting younger and younger. No longer bound to his wheelchair, his cells appear to be regenerating at an alarming rate. Crusher discovers that Jameson has taken some kind of mythical drug that is currently de-aging him.It turns out that the hostage situation was set up by the planet's leader all along to draw out Jameson. 40 years ago, Jameson supplied weapons to the warring factions during a civil war that lead to years upon years of bloodshed. He regrets his decision and has come to atone for it. They beam Jameson down and it takes Picard a while to prove to the planet's leader that this young man really is Jameson. But he's de-aged to quickly, his body can't handle it and he dies in his wife's arms. The hostages are released and the Enterprise moves on.This episode is messy, plain and simple. I read that this was one of the last scripts they let Roddenberry tweak and it completely changed the writer's original intention. You can see that this got passed around a few times by the threads that seemingly go nowhere. The de-aging ends up meaning absolutely nothing to the story. He ends up dying anyways so why even include it? It turns into filler when you don't follow through with it or show what happens when you attempt to relive the last.Some of the dialogue is extremely heavy-handed as well, especially between Jameson and Karnas. And that makeup! That first iteration of Jameson as an old man is some of the worst aging makeup I've seen in a while.What's weird about this episode too is that it's not really ensemble driven. None of the main cast really take center stage, it's all about Jameson and Karnas here. Picard is hovering around but this story isn't about him, he's a supporting character.

3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" When the Bough Breaks (TV Episode 1988)",Sensationalism Faces Off Against the Cultural Importance of Calculus,"Riker is ecstatic about the legend of an Atlantis in the Epsilon Mynos system (reported to be the planet Aldea). Enterprise investigates the system and discovers a cloaked planet, Aldea.Two of the leaders of the Aldeans make contact with the Enterprise for the purpose of trade. However, they want a few Enterprise children to help replenish their infertile population. Picard, of course, refuses, so the Aldeans use their superior technology to steal a few specially selected children.So ""When the Bough Breaks"" (Episode 16, Season 1, Air Date 02/15/88, Star-date 41509.1) introduces the Utopian world of Aldea and its many advancements, and it has the Enterprise crew try to rescue their stolen children back from the Aldeans.Riker describes the vision of Aldea as a highly technologically advanced world in which people are free to pursue a life of art and culture and peace. His picture of the Aldeans is basically true of the world in some ways, but the Aldeans have also lapsed in their knowledge of science and medicine.*Spoiler's Follow*We have to watch much silly sensationalism in the process (as Spock would call it!). Yes, humans are attached to their kids and we are willing to die for them. So we ignore the potential for trading our children to leap years ahead in science (the Aldeans promise to exchange some of their scientific knowledge for some of our children). But, it seems, the information the Aldeans offer to us probably isn't as valuable as they suggest since (as we later find out) they don't even know how it works anymore!Wesley also learns the Aldeans have lost their knowledge of the way their technology works. This leads the Aldeans to fail to discover a radiation leak or radiation side effect coming from their power source. It causes them to become infertile, become sensitive to light, and lose their appetite.Some Aldean power is well intact, however. Radue, a leader of the Aldeans, uses a repulsor beam to blast the Enterprise far away (three days at warp 9) as a demonstration of his power.But Wesley leads the children in nonviolent and peaceful resistance, having the other children refuse to eat, while Picard makes his way back to Aldea.Some minor plot points include:(1) Aldea uses technology to bend light around its planet and make itself invisible to outsiders.(2) The Aldeans use a Custodian central computer and power system to take care of all their physical and technological concerns.(3) The Aldeans can scan for hidden abilities and potential within the children they steal. Apparently they have scanning technology that discloses inner skills for music (Alexandra), sculpting (Harry), or science and technology (as in the case of Wesley).(4) The Aldeans have cameras all through their civilization, so Wesley can ask the Custodian to show him a few of the other children. Does this make anyone there worry about privacy?(5) One of the little girls (Alexandria) learns to use a musical device that senses her music-thoughts-or-feelings. Harry learns to sculpt with a tool that draws out his inner image of a dolphin sculpture. These seem like magical tools to me, but perhaps it's a case of tools being so advanced they seem like magic to us (or to any lesser technologically advanced civilization).But my favorite part of the episode emphasizes the importance of science and math to our culture. The Aldeans concentrate on culture and the arts to the detriment of science, and this shows that Riker's vision of Aldea is too narrow (and must include tough subjects like calculus).My favorite part of the episode has the dying Aldeans, and Enterprise and its crew, teach us the importance of science.For example, one of the opening scenes of the episode has a little boy, Harry, run away from his calculus teacher, bump into Riker, and get sent back to class by his father. But later Harry gets selected by the Aldeans for his hidden sculpting ability.After the crew of Enterprise use their knowledge of science and technology to outsmart the Aldeans and get their kids back, Harry tells his father he wants to quit calculus and become a sculptor. His father says Harry can do anything he wants, but he must continue to study calculus.Yes! Calculus and science are important for this very reason. If our culture allowed our citizens to quit tough subjects, we would no doubt become as superficial and as purely artsy and lazy as the Aldeans. (For all the teachers out there, the next time a student whines about the meaninglessness of your subject, especially science and math, just tell them about the miserable Aldeans and our own dark ages.)The episode works for me since I loved its pro-science message, and it also has a well thought out vision of a misguided, mere artsy driven civilization.",

Or, why not let the children and their families come to live on the planet? After all, the population is very, very low and any influx of people would be a plus. Yet, through the entire show NO ONE THINKS OF EITHER OF THESE ALTERNATIVES!!! Talk about lousy writing.

5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" When the Bough Breaks (TV Episode 1988)",One of My Least Favorites So Far,"In ""When the Bough Breaks"" the Enterprise finds an advanced, hidden, idyllic planet that has been using a cloaking device for thousands of years. They've exposed themselves because they are requesting that the Federation trade with their people, the Aldeans. For access to their advanced knowledge the Aldeans are requesting the children of the Enterprise. They citizens have all become sterile and need outside beings to make sure their culture co tinies to flourish. When Picard refuses this demand, the Aldeans kidnap some of the children of the Enterprise and give them new families.Wesley is included in this group and soon starts a passive resistance strike. Data finds a way to break through the planet's shield and an away team heads down and knocks out Aldea's central computer the Custodian. Picard and Crusher tell the Aldeans that the reason they're unable to procreate and why they're all dying is that they're getting radioactive poisoning from the Custodian. They've gotten lazy over the years and no longer even maintain the computer, hence why it's spewing out waste. The Federation promises to help them restore the balance and to get them healthy again. The crew reclaims their children and heads off on another adventure.I found this to be pretty sappy, heavy-handed, and dumb. They try to draw some parallels with Earth's ecological and nuclear energy situation and it just comes across as preachy. I love a good parallel and metaphor in my sci-fi content but the stretch they're making here is laughable.It also makes me mad that the Enterprise and the Aldeans never even consider busing over a ship full of orphans who need families. If the Aldeans need a legacy so bad, just head back to Earth and pick up some unwanted kids. Why is this never considered? Even if Crusher and the Federation can make these people healthy and virile again, aren't most of them too old to have kids anyways? We're told that Sue Ellen Mischke is the last child ever born on the planet. She's already well into her 20's so I have to assume there is a limited stock of adults of a child-bearing age. Let's bring in some orphans!Also, you think this powerful super-computer knwon as the Custodian would warn somebody that the radiation is making them all sick. If these people's ancestors were smart enough to be able to cloak and entire planet, you'd think they could set up a radiation detection system as well.Too many plot holes with a bad analogy makes for a bad TNG episode.",2

These people are so superior and yet are quite out of touch, with their own abilities and future. It is an episode that goes nowhere and is so dull.

7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" When the Bough Breaks (TV Episode 1988)",When the Bough Breaks,"If I'm honest, ""When the Bough Breaks"" isn't a bad episode, but it is just a bit too sappy for my tastes and once again exploits, ""Hey, we got the star of Stand by Me in our cast, let him be the pick of the litter if special kids are to be kidnapped by an alien world in need of offspring to restart civilization"". I just explained the plot in that quote. There's this world with all the wonders one could ever dream of. A machine's core furnishes the people all they need in comfort and luxury. It even cloaks the planet, therefore hiding it from possible threats! However, this very machine's core that gives them everything also causes radiation that makes them sterile. No children left and the people are all slowly succumbing to the radiation poisoning that will soon leave their world desolate and dead. Technology, sophisticated and advanced, will prove to be difficult for Picard and the Enterprise crew as they try to uncover a means to beam the kidnapped children back aboard the ship. Parents losing their children is horrifying enough, but the helplessness of not being able to get to them because of a technology so advanced even a galaxy class starship cannot free them is just as scary. Like I mentioned at the very beginning, the plot in itself is not bad, but the brunt of the episode features the cutesy kids placed in a situation where they like the people on the planet yet desire to return to their own parents on the Enterprise. This episode is all about getting the most of Wil Wheaton, a child star I guess Paramount felt needed to be shoved down our throats until we gag. Nothing against Wheaton, really, (I do love his episode with a young Ashley Judd called ""The Game""), but that first season sure got him in the plots as much as possible so that the young audience would perhaps be lured to watch. Whatever the case, he gets the other children to strike so that the aliens (led by The X Files' Jerry Hardin and Brenda Strong, a veteran actress of television) will maybe get mad and want them to leave. Picard and company do believe there is a glitch in the planet's shield technology, or at least in the people's machine (it requires certain voices to command it, and the downfall of the surviving aliens is allowing Wesley access to it) which controls it, and this might be the answer to rescuing the children This episode pokes fun at Picard's discomfort with children.",5

It centers around terraforming a planet (on this planet they can do it in 40 years or so), and how they mistakenly begin the process even though there is life on there (though not life as we know it). This episode hearkens back to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn with the Genesis project - one of the rules is you have to make sure the planet is dead - then you go into several phases before the process in completed - I enjoy these homages to the Original Series. Once more, this episode really gets to the heart of Gene Roddenberry's vision - how peace is the answer when meeting a new life (even one that's completely different from us), about how we are prone to mistakes and though that's inevitable, it's how we act once we realize we made the mistake that makes all the difference. Highly recommended episode.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Home Soil (TV Episode 1988)",Home Soil,"I think ""Home Soil"" is what Star Trek is all about. ""To seek out new life forms and"" is the mantra for the exploration of space and the desire to discover life. This episode questions ""what is life?"" and when an inorganic life form, emanating a light (..and, at times, a hum), is discovered after a terraformer is brutally murdered by a reprogrammed laser on a planet declared dead by the Federation (terraformers are special scientists who take a dead world, giving it life, in essence, creating evolution through scientific means; basically man take the place of God), Picard has it transported to the Enterprise Medical Lab for further study. They are trying to determine if this inorganic form is actually a ""life form"" and if it is, the Velara III terraforming project—responsible for creating life—may very well have been contributors to nearly destroying life. The Enterprise crew, through study and watching the life form evolve before their eyes, determine it is actually a ""microbrain"", even believing it operates as a computer, eventually even ""interconnecting"" with the ship's own computer-system. Without the computers of the Enterprise, Picard will have to discover its weakness and exploit that to save the crew aboard her. What I enjoy about this episode is the enthusiasm we see in the cast as they learn slowly of the life form aboard their ship. Right from when it is barely visible, looking like a Christmas tree light, the crew are attempting to verify if it is alive, and I appreciated the performances, how Picard and Crusher, specifically, seem quite passionate about their new discovery. When it is determined that the life form is actually intelligent, trying to communicate with them, this may be an opening to learn more about it. I like how the episode follows this journey of encountering new life for the first time, coming to an agreement after a struggle to halt a declaration of war, and the promising possibility in a future where human life forms and these intelligent inorganic life forms can co-exist together. You know, it wasn't until I started thinking about it tonight, but The Next Gen did a really swell job using the Betazed Deanna Troi as a tool to develop a grab for an audience because she can sense feelings from others, cluing not only Picard in but us as well on possible hidden motives or buried emotions...as was the case with the concerned head Terraformer, leading Picard to send an away team just because of his lack of welcome towards them, and mysterious feelings that seemed to signify he's hiding something from them.",8
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Home Soil (TV Episode 1988)",A Rather Entertaining Episode,"In order to see a real working terraforming colony, the crew beams down to a facility where something is amiss. These people are working on turning an arid desert planet with no life (or so they think) into a prosperous green planet. Some of the crew relish the idea, but a couple of others, including the leader of the operation are really uptight. It seems that something has been taking control of equipment and using it against the colonists. Commander Data is nearly killed. Only his android quickness and strength saves him. Soon a sort of non carbon based life form is found. It is multiplying and gaining strength. It actively gains control of the computer. The problem is communicating with it and getting it to back off. It turns out that the benevolence of the colonists (based on their personal view of this world) has actually turned deadly to the indigenous life forms. This is cleverly done speculative fiction which warns that there are sometimes implications to things we do, even with the best of intentions.",8

4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Home Soil (TV Episode 1988)",Very unusual but entertaining.,"The Enterprise has been ordered to go to a planet that is being terraformed into new planet. For some odd reason, the planet has been ignoring contact from the Federation and they need to investigate. When the Captain contacts the base's leader (Walter Gotell), he is very evasive and unfriendly and it's obviously he does NOT want them coming to the planet's surface. Once there, it's obvious SOMETHING is up, as a laser seems to come to life on its own and kills one of the workers. Then, it tries to kill Data. Someone or something is controlling the laser--and Picard is determined to investigate further. Eventually the root cause is discovered--and inorganic life form! Gordi and Data bring the small speck-like being to the ship for examination--and soon it begins to grow, refuse to stay in containment and takes control of the computer systems. Obviously it IS intelligent. And, obviously the leader of the base was trying to create a new planet by destroying the inorganic life form--which clearly violates the Prime Directive. In many ways, this episode reminds me of one from the original ""Star Trek"" series--the one where miners inadvertently are killing the eggs of an inorganic creature, the Horta. Here, the entity is of a much different form but the concept is quite similar. Overall, a very interesting episode and one that manages to be entertaining despite a very simple idea and a very non-traditional alien!",7

Kurt Mandl, the lead scientist, just wants Enterprise to go away. But Deanna Troi senses fear and anxiety about Enterprise's presence, so Picard sends an 'away team' to investigate.""Home Soil"" (Episode 17, Season 1, Air Date 02/22/88, Star-date 41463.9) introduces the theme of terraforming and it continues its quest for new life.*Spoiler's Follow*The idea of terraforming and its God-like power:(1) We hear that terraforming is like being a god, which is a great allusion to 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan' and other original series movies in which the genesis project sought to transform completely uninhabited planets into life bearing worlds.(2) But Star Fleet bans any terraforming on planets where any life at all exists or where life has any chance of developing. This fits with an odd interpretation of the prime directive to avoid manipulating other worlds and their natural development.(3) Star Fleet carefully selects planets for terraforming. Planets must be the 'right mass, gravity, have the correct rate of rotation, and have a balanced day and night'. I would add that planets must be the right distance from a star, for if they are too far away, solar power would be a problem. It may also help to choose a planet with a protective atmosphere, with a young to middle aged star, with a moderate temperature (this doesn't follow from having balanced nights and days), and with a clear orbit to avoid high chances of life destroying impacts. Many factors would impact our choice.(4) The next phases after selection are to introduce microorganisms into the planet's water supply. This allows the production of oxygen over time.But many writers and SF thinkers have questioned the conditions for life. Michael Crichton's 'The Andromeda Strain' imagines microorganisms that best survive above a oxygen rich atmosphere since oxygen is a corrosive. And Star Trek has long been in the business of imagining exotic life, including a rock monster made famous by its larger parody in 'Galaxy Quest'.As the terraformers explain all this, Arthur Malencon is ordered to continue his work removing the salt content from the planet's water supply. But while he works, he gets attacked by his own laser drill. Data investigates the laser and begins to test it the same way Arthur Malencon did, but he gets attacked as well. Data suspects the laser that tried to kill him was programmed by someone or some thing intelligent.Geordi uses his enhanced visor to point out elaborate patterns and infrared pulses from crystals in the water below; he suspects signs of life even though it can't be from organic life. The Enterprise brings one of the crystals to the ship and begins investigating its nature.The definition of life:(1) The crystal doesn't fit any definition for life, but it emits light the way we would expect of a life form.(2) Dr. Crusher says something is an *organic* life form if it can assimilate, respirate, reproduce, grow, develop, move, secrete, excrete. Carl Sagan says in his 'Cosmos' series that he would require organic life to be carbon based; he thinks a silicon based life form is unlikely to exist.(3) The way to determine whether the crystals qualify is to observe, theorize, and find evidence -- just the way one normally does in science.(4) But then she looks for a definition of an *inorganic* life form, and she gets growth, development, and reproduction.(5) The crystal is investigated very much the same way as in 'The Andromeda Strain' with advanced magnification equipment and computer analysis of its composition. And 'The Andromdea Strain' also used the crystal as the basis of a strange new form of life.The crystal turns out to be silicon based, with growth, development, and reproduction. When it starts using those three things (the three conditions for inorganic life) it advances into an intelligent computer micro-brain. We learn that it forms an intelligent collective with the other crystals and that it had used salt to communicate with each other (the very salt we were trying to remove to make water supportive of organic life).So it declares war with humans (those 'bags of mostly water') and comes to believe that humans are too arrogant for civilized contact. Its colony of crystals tried to communicate with the terraformers through strange sand patterns, but it eventually takes over the ship computer and uses it to achieve communication.This is a good example of where humans are dangerous invaders of a lifeforms environment and where our traditional definition of life fails to take into account possible counterexamples of life missed by our definition. Michael Crichton in fact dismisses the whole idea of giving a definition of life as an impossible game of logic, since counterexamples always exist ('The Andromeda Strain'). But, like I said, Carl Sagan would limit life to include only substances with carbon as its base element, which excludes rock monsters and crystal entities ('Cosmos').And it's an example of a very broad definition of life inclusive of inorganic material.",
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Home Soil (TV Episode 1988)",The Genesis Project Lives On,"In ""Home Soil"" the Enterprise visits the planet of Velara III where a team of scientists are terraforming the barren planet's surface to make it livable. The scientists' leader seems hesitant to have them here and suspicion of him only rises when a rogue laser goes out of control and kills one of the scientists.Data tried to investigate how this happened, only to almost be cut down himself. He destroys the laser drill but theorizes that it was being controlled or programmed by someone for nefarious reasons.Geordi discovers an oddity at the laser's dig site: a non-carbon lifeform. It looks like a little beam of light. Riker has it sent back to the Enterprise for testing in the lab. But the crew looks as if it has underestimated this unknown lifeform's power. Soon it is taking over controls and attempting to communicate with the humans. They declare war on Picard. Data figures out that if they cut the lights, the lifeform will be unable to survive for long. They cut the light and negotiate peace: the Enterprise will beam back the lifeform and leave it in peace for a few hundred years.This episode feels like a sequel of sorts to the TOS classic ""The Devil in the Dark"". Both involve the concept of non-carbon lifeforms fighting back against humanity when their environment is threatened, unbeknownst to the threateners.It seems a bit odd that the crew (especially Data) is unaware of the discovery of non-carbon lifeforms in the past. If memory serves me right, the mining outpost was developing a partnership with the Horta at the end of ""The Devil in the Dark"" after Spock mindmelds with one of the mothers. You think at least one scientist aboard the Enterprise would have been aware of this amazing new type of life that was discovered a mere 100 years ago.Anyways, I thought this episode was pretty solid, definitely above the Season 1 average thus far. We only have one plot line here to speak of with no subplots so if you don't like the main storyline, tough luck. I like seeing Data and Geordi's friendship blossom. Geordi seems genuinely concerned when Data's locked in the drilling room with the rogue laser. I also like that they both use their gifts to discover what the terraformers overlooked: this new lifeform.Some of the cast get more to do here than others. Yar is in a limited role as is typical of late Season 1. Worf gets about two or three lines. Even Riker is pushed into the background a bit to make room for Crusher, Geordi, and Data.I guess the main message here is the warning of unintended consequences. Like introducing rabbits into Australia, humans have a tendency to change the environments around them without a full understanding of the long term consequences. Even when we have the best intentions, sometimes we can do more harm than good with our tunnel vision. In an attempt to create life, the scientists here are unintentionally destroying it. Sometimes we just need to cede to Mother Nature.",6
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Home Soil (TV Episode 1988)",whether he wants it or not..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 01A promising start for the series, where cases may come and go, but the chemistry among the cast is what amps up the charge, with background still kept under the shades and just skimming off the surface of their equations, the makers have managed to tease us and hook us from the first adventure itself.Home SoilA personification of an unknown object has always been this franchise's major asset, fabricating it with an emotional attachment or manipulating the viewers into believing in, in its well spiraled ideologies, this is another typical textbook formula from the writers.",
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Home Soil (TV Episode 1988)",A Case for Human Development.,"When I watched this episode I had this 'You gotta be kidding me' attitude towards the premise of the show, but it is Star Trek. But then I started to think this episode has a lot of arguments for the pro-life movement back here in the 21st century.Think about it. The crew discovered that there was a ""life-force"" dwelling beneath the surface of the planet. A ""life-force"" capable of defending itself by injuring a terraformer with a laser 'tool'.As the episode progresses the life-force begins to grow, and as its ""cells"" multiply it gains more intelligence and consciousness while being held in the medical lab aboard the Enterprise. When it communicates ultimately with the ""ugly water bags"" all it wants is to be able to grow on its own terms in its own world. The life-force 'points its finger' so to speak at us humans for being ""arrogant"" and ""primitive"". ""Come back in three centuries"" then ""we may trust you"" it tells Picard and crew. So this life-force, as it is allowed to grow understands its rights (defends itself), and the concept of truth.Picard acknowledges that he (speaking for all us humans) doesn't want to be at war, only wants peace. Shouldn't we want that same attitude for the ""life-force"" inside a woman's womb? Shouldn't that single cell be allowed to grow so that it can multiply, gain intelligence and develop a consciousness in its own time? Counsellor Troi said ""We see and hear you now...You are beautiful to us. All life is beautiful."" Where are the Troi's of the 21st century when it comes to the tissue growths inside the womb? Do we have to wait ""three centuries"" to understand; to get it? Do we put a higher value on these external life-forces over our own offspring as it develops in the womb? Isn't ""all life beautiful"" even if it does grow to become an ""ugly water bag?"" That's the whole message of this episode. Protect life in all its forms.",7

reports said annoyance to the captain.I think the subplot is stronger however. Commander Robert Ito and a few
candidates for StarFleet Academy are also on board and the Enterprise is used
as a training exercise field. That offers no advantage to Wil Wheaton who is

Here in this particular episode, however, their goals are unclear and the pair are involved in some sort of loyalty investigation--and it comes off a bit like the investigations during the so-called 'Red Scare' of the late 1940s and into the 50s. The other plot involves Acting Ensign Crusher going to take the Starfleet exam. While Crusher does not yet enter the academy, this will take up quite a bit of the show later--when he is absent from the ship and a few episodes involve his academy life.

Remmick won't tell anyone his objective, but only that he suspects a discrepancy in the Captain's log.""Coming of Age"" (Episode 18, Season 1, Air Date 03/14/88, Star-date 41461.2) switches between two threads of plot line -- Wesley's multiphase entrance tests and Remmick's disruptive and invasive questions.*Spoiler's Follow*While Wesley takes his test, Picard and his crew must suffer Remmick's glaring eyes and annoying questions. Riker gets testy. There are some action sequences to put the crew to the test and demonstrate their teamwork and loyalty to Picard.We hear about past episodes during Remmick's investigation of the Captain's log, but the episode seems to misinterpret Picard's decision in 'Justice' (Picard actually said he thought the prime directive was never intended to prevent him from saving Wesley; Picard doesn't say he violated the intent of the prime directive).Wesley Crusher's entrance exam for Star Fleet Academy consists of (1) a set of science questions; (2) a spatial & speed test to arrange certain chaotic computer objects; (3) intermittent practical tests, such as reacting to an angry Zaldan; (4) and a psych test that challenges applicants to face their greatest fear.The psych test would be very difficult to grade and seems like something a script writer would create more so than a space academy concerned to find the best applicant.But apparently applicants have many pre-requisites to accumulate prior to the test since the test director, Lieutenant Chang, tells them they all merit consideration for the Academy. The other applicants are a Vulcan (T'Shanik), a Benzite (Mordock), and another human (Oliana Mirren). Mordock is already famous for one of his inventions, so the competition looks difficult and only one person can advance to the Academy out of the four.During the third part of Wesley's test, he bumps into an angry Zaldan and must correctly deal with the situation. Zaldans are humanoids with webbed fingers, but they believe one should never engage in fake social conventions. Wesley calms the Zaldan by yelling back at him rather than excusing himself or apologizing for bumping into him. We should be more like the Zaldans!Wesley must react to another fake scene and face his 'greatest fear' in the final part of testing. But I found the Academy test a bit implausible. For example, NASA would use regular psychological measurements for its psych profile (but that's not even a condition for becoming an astronaut, just a pre-launch safety check sort of step), not a drama-club like scenario right out of Orwell's '1984' as the one Wesley must pass. Yes, a director testing actors for fake 'personality' would do that, but not NASA!In case you are wondering, NASA astronauts (1) must have a 'bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering, biological science, physical science, or mathematics' and possibly an advanced degree or experience in a related technical profession for mission specialist positions; (2) and they have to pass a space physical: good vision of '20/100 or better uncorrected, correctable to 20/20 each eye'; good blood pressure of '140/90 measured in a sitting position'; and an acceptable height between 64 and 76 inches; (3) pilots must have 'at least 1,000 hours pilot-in-command time in a jet aircraft' and possibly 'flight test experience'.These are more practical standards that a space agency would create. Wesley must pass the standards of a script writer, trained in drama class and by English teachers (kidding)! Obviously the Academy is more of an academic institution since it doesn't specify anything about a physical requirement as part of the test.This is an excellent episode for all the little touches. Picard must make an interesting decision about his career, Wesley must face his greatest fear, and the crew must defend against an intentionally invasive review of their performance. But I wish they would have created better tests for the Academy!",
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Coming of Age (TV Episode 1988)",Starfleet Academy Logistics and Recruiting,"A good episode for season 1. But I want to talk about this Starfleet Academy admittance procedure.
This episode explains that only 1 (one*!) person per year is admitted to Starfleet from this planet. Now unless admission is based on world population, with an appropriate ratio, the implication seems to be one person per planet per year. Wesley has no connection to this plant, he just seems to be around here when the test is happening. In fact, AT LEAST 3 of the 4 applicants are certainly not born on this world (1 Vulcan, 1 Benzite, Wesley and another human), so already the logistics are confusing.Now, I looked this up and there are 183 member species, and 895 Billion individual lives in the Federation. Lets assume each of those species have on average a few different well colonized planets - populous enough to merit academy testing. Now this episode means to tell us, that only one person per planet is able to START the training for Starfleet. if we multiply 183 member species by 4 colonised planets we get about 730 worlds. that is slightly over a billion lives per world so probably its being generous. So Starfleet, which is responsible for hundreds of billions of lives, is allowing 700 people maximum per year to go to Starfleet academy? Surely not everyone passes. If 600 of them graduate each year, is that really enough personnel to staff an organisation that has influence and responsibility over a quarter of the galaxy? I think not.Does this mean Earth gets one applicant per year? How outrageous. Imagine if every country on Earth only hired one new policeman, one new fireman, or one new solider every year. Laughable. They even sound remorseful at the end when they declare its too bad because they would all make good candidates. Why would this system ever exist? What if Earth had 1000 great applicants and Vulcan's best 10 were all lesser applicants?By my numbers it is safe to assume that even with a more generous future retirement ages (humans live to be older in Star Trek), there are only about 50,000 total active Starfleet officers. 50,000 for 895 Billion lives! For reference there are almost 1 Million Police officers in the United States of America, for only 300+ Million people. To say nothing of other services.It's season one and the universe had not been as fleshed out but come on Gene. You invented this intergalactic Federation, and you invented its intergalactic military/police/exploration/diplomacy arm. This system is bogus and I am pretty sure Wesley does something different later anyway.",8

Obviously Picard wasn't ready to leave the Enterprise so this will be turned down, but this will not be the last time Quinn and Remmick will be seen: fascinating enough, these two, dedicated in trying to prove the Federation was being invaded from within the most powerful positions, fall prey to the very ""corrupting influence"" they were after.

A distressed officer on board the Enterprise (Wesley beat out to win the coveted spot to take the tests on the planet) steals a shuttlecraft, with plans to meet a freighter, losing power, heading for the planet's atmosphere, certain to burn up unless Picard (Remmick watching, with plenty of questions towards his curious methods) can save him out of harm's way. Mordock, a Benzite, is one of the Starfleet hopefuls who befriends Wesley (Wesley even helps him win a test, almost breaking a record, sacrificing his own results), as a female Vulcan and a cute human girl (who calls Wesley cute with him gushing) also participate in the round of tests. Wesley's score just falls short and in disappointment doesn't think he deserves to join the Enterprise crew in the Admiral's farewell dinner, Picard admitting he himself failed the first time! It is a nice bonding moment for Picard and Wesley. The interviews between Rimmick and Picard's crew (Troi, LaForge, Data, Riker, Worf, and Crusher) are among the best scenes in the episode, strongly defending their Captain and his abilities in the position over the Enterprise. When Rimmick proclaims he would like to serve on the Enterprise when his current duties are over, it is a testament to the way Picard operates as leader and Captain.",7
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Coming of Age (TV Episode 1988)",Trying to Uncover Dirt on Picard,"In ""Coming of Age"" Wesley is chosen to take the entrance exam into the Star Fleet Academy. The exam takes place on nearby Relva VII where an old friend of Picard's (Admiral Quinn) happens to be. He pops up to the Enterprise ostensibly for a friendly visit. It turns out however that Picard and the Enterprise are under investigation for unknown reasons. Quinn's right-hand man is tasked with turning over every rock he can on the ship and interview all personnel.Picard and the ship pass with flying colors and Quinn reveals this was all a vetting process to promote Picard to Admiral and put him in charge of the Academy. Quinn is worried there are spys and usurpers high up in Star Fleet and he wants men he can trust in positions of authority in case things go sour. Picard declines and remains captain of the Enterprise.Meanwhile down on the planet, Wesley makes a friend with a fellow testee, Mordock. In the end, Wesley helps Mordock across the finish line of the test. Mordock wins and feels bad that he's taking Wesley's place but the result stands. Wesley will just have to try again next year.This is a Wesley-heavy episode which is almost always a bad sign. I really couldn't care less about his plotline during this. Mordock's design is pretty cool and it's nice seeing a Vulcan on TNG since we really haven't even encountered any thus far. The one scene of this I did like was Worf giving advice to Wesley in the holodeck. This is one of the first scenes of the series where we really get to see Worf shine.The investigation itself is pretty boring. It's more interesting when viewed as a building block for a future related episode, less interesting as a standalone story. I did like when Quinn's assistant requests to be on the Enterprise and Picard gives me that icy stare. Hilarious.The one scene I did like was the interview montage where the person being interrogated changes with each question. It's all edited together rather well. Even though I'm not the hugest fan of this one, I can't deny that it was directed and written pretty well. I just think the overall plot ideas are rather pedestrian.",5
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Coming of Age (TV Episode 1988)",Interesting but Not So Original,"Until I started re watching this series, I didn't realize what a dominant presence Wesley was early on. He has already done two or three things that have saved the bacon of the crew. In this one he is about go to a place where he and three other candidates will vie for a single entry into Star Fleet Academy. Of course, the things they do are beyond our understanding (as well as the script writers). It's hard to imagine him having so much punch on board, but that's entertainment. The other, more serious, plot involves an investigation on board the Enterprise the object of which is completely hidden from us. An over-zealous investigator with no sense of humor and no tact begins to grill the crew. Everything seems to center around Picard's competence. The mysterious nature of this will apparently be explained at a later date, as my fellow reviewers have indicated. The Academy test is interesting with four candidates, one a Vulcan and the other a guy who apparently needs a tray under his chin to breath in some vapors. There is also the other earthling, a very attractive young woman who Wesley has a Crusher on (bad joke). Anyway, the final test, while interesting, has been done to death in other settings on other shows. Pretty easy to see it coming.",6
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Coming of Age (TV Episode 1988)",to beam abroad..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 01A promising start for the series, where cases may come and go, but the chemistry among the cast is what amps up the charge, with background still kept under the shades and just skimming off the surface of their equations, the makers have managed to tease us and hook us from the first adventure itself.Coming Of AgeTesting the depth of the water, there isn't any particular threat scrutinized in here but the stakes still are high as there is Wheaton's future in question and Stewart's equation with him and performance brings out the best outcome.",
0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Heart of Glory (TV Episode 1988)",Welcome back Klingons,"ST:TNG:20 - ""Heart Of Glory"" (Stardate: 41503.7) - this is the first The Next Generation episode to deal with Worf's history and his Klingon heritage. It mentions how he came to be on the Enterprise - that of the Khitomer massacre which a child Worf was one of the survivors - he was rescued by a human who raised him along with his wife and son (his foster parents and brother will be seen in future episodes). This is also the episode that made use of Geordi's visor as a camera as he boards a ship full of Klingons - ironically it would be used by Klingons in Star Trek: Generations to view into the Enterprise. Also the peace of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is the key ingredient in this episode, since these Klingons say that the peace subverted their warrior instincts. And, the Romulans are mentioned here - is a foreshadowing for the 1st season closing episode ""The Neutral Zone"". Trivia: a nice homage to Jerry Goldsmith's Klingon theme can be heard throughout the episode.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Heart of Glory (TV Episode 1988)",Heart of Glory,"""Heart of Glory"" really feels like the beginning of how The Next Generation will incorporate the 24th Century Klingons into the Star Trek Universe and I couldn't think of a better way to explore and define the Worf character than with this superb episode. Three Klingon warriors are found on board a rapidly deteriorating Talarian freighter, a ship that suffered extensive damage after a major battle. After a hair-raising transportation that nearly saw away team members Riker, Data, and Geordi (testing out a new visual device which would allow Picard and the Bridge to see ""through his eyes"" while on missions away from the Enterprise) almost perish as the interference of emanating deutronium gas disrupted the ability of transporting them, Worf spends time with two of the Klingons (the third, in bad condition, dies from his injuries) and begins to find a connection with their warrior spirits, in turn, coming closer to understanding his heritage, not to mention, the fire that burns within. This episode really informs not only the viewer but the Enterprise crew (Picard, Riker, etc) of the Klingon way; they are the first humans to actually see the Klingon Death Oath (basically a growl to the heavens informing the dead that a Klingon warrior is about to enter). Honor, loyalty, respect, and duty are applicable Klingon traits, but Worf must confront his brothers of how they lost their sight of what it truly is to be a Klingon, when using the freighter, they tricked a Klingon ship into letting down their shields, firing upon them, destroying them. This will be an ongoing theme, Worf's uneasy relations with his Klingon brethren who have a hard time with his being a Federation officer. Considered weak and puny like the humans, Worf, time and again, must prove his meddle, often resulting in an internal struggle, torn between sides, his people and the Federation. Because of this, The Next Generation provided some great storytelling. The dialogue between Worf and Captain Korris (a formidable Vaughn Armstrong, who instills a pride and unyielding desire in his character to live, breathe, and die as his warrior ancestors once did) is the heart and soul of this emotionally stirring episode. I imagine ""Heart of Glory"" is a key fan favorite of those who love the Klingon character and their history as defined by Star Trek. The tension of the Klingon and Federation relations is quite visible here, such as when Picard seems almost offended by a Klingon Commander's offer to help him capture Korris, who has escaped confinement from Security and is loose on the Enterprise. One of the most memorable scenes I imagine is when Worf leaves his Bridge crew stunned at a potential acceptance of an offer by the Klingon Commander to join him once his time with the Federation is complete.",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Heart of Glory (TV Episode 1988)",Uncomfortable peace?,"When the Enterprise investigates a ship which had recently been in battle they find three Klingon survivors and bring them aboard and treat their injuries. We get to see through Geordi's visor for the first time too. The Klingons are somewhat surprised to see Worf aboard and we learn a lot of Worf's background too. Interestingly the Klingons are not all too comfortable with the peace with the Federation and it transpires they have battled with Klingons to make their escape, much to the disdain of Worf. They eventually try and escape and die during the attempt in which Worf is left with a showdown with the last Klingon. Worf shows some of his true colours and his training in Starfleet come to light as it will later in the series. The Klingon ship which has arrived to take them back is informed and Worf greets the Klingon Captain. This episode gave Worf a chance to shine so early into the show",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Heart of Glory (TV Episode 1988)","Finally...a Worf episode. And, a chance for a little Klingon bromance.","When the show begins, the Enterprise learns that some sort of battle has taken place inside the Neutral Zone. Considering that this could mean that the Romulans are running amok, the crew is naturally anxious to get there. However, what they find is not at all what they expected and it's all quite confusing. Instead of the Romulans, they find a heavily damaged freighter and three Klingons aboard this non-Klingon ship. They claim that the vessel was attacked by Ferengi. However, much of their story does not ring true and the Captain is doubtful as to who these Klingons really are and why they were in this odd location. Eventually, they learn that the two surviving Klingons are wanted renegades and the Klingon Empire wants their return. However, during the interim, Worf becomes close with the men and they do some good old fashioned bro bonding. Because of this, he learns a bit about what it's like to be a Klingon (he was orphaned and raised among humans) and how it is to be a manly Klingon warrior. And, his loyalty is quite divided as a result.For me, Worf was one of the better characters in this series. He was so popular, apparently, that he continued this character on ""Deep Space 9"". So, it's long overdue that we have an episode that explains a bit about his heritage and struggles with negotiating between the human and Klingon worlds. Well worth seeing and, finally, a chance for some good old fashioned violence--something there has so far been very, very little of in the series! And, about both I say 'it's about time'! Later Klingon episodes were exceptional--especially in what Worf learns about the true heart and spirit of the Klingons...and it ain't what Worf thinks. All in all, a very worthy first Klingon episode. Well written and a nice exploration of the species' psyche.",9
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Heart of Glory (TV Episode 1988)",Klingon Glory Teaches Us of Different Cultures,"The Enterprise runs into a suspicious Talarian ship and sends an 'away team' to check it out, including Geordi with a special visor recorder. Picard is fascinated with Geordi's visual acuity sensor, which allows the Enterprise to receive the same signals from Geordi's visor that Geordi receives.But Geordi doesn't experience the same perceptive world we experience. Geordi is accustomed to filtering the flux and bombardment of his cluttered information while we experience a jumble of nonsense. (Never mind that Geordi has similar experiential networks in his mind as us and that his mind never evolved to interpret such information better than us.)In any case, most of ""Heart of Glory"" (Season 1, Episode 19, Air Date 03/21/88, Star-date 41503.7) introduces Worf's cultural history and his interaction with two Klingons found in the Talarian ship. It's mainly an episode about anthropology and the Klingon ethos. It introduces the theme of a warrior ethos: the Klingon code of honor and glory.The Klingon ethos reminds me of some of the values of heroes in ancient Greek epic poems, such as Achilles in Homer's ""Iliad"". Klingons are fierce fighters and believe glory is won on the battlefield (but the Greek heroes were more emotional and quick to fall into tears, which went out of style in our modern view of masculinity).We learn some of the Klingon superstitions and their ethics. They will not take little girls hostage (since there is no honor in such an act). Times have changed and the two Klingons burn for traditional Klingon virtues. But Worf tries to teach his fellow Klingons that glory includes internal discipline, loyalty, and duty, not just courage on the battlefield.This episode showcases the very thing the new ""Star Trek"" (2009) movie absolutely lacks in every way. It introduces a new species and then contrasts them with our own values, as a way to show that different races may have very different values and still be technologically and scientifically advanced. It doesn't humanize the Klingons and turn them into cuddly emotional human mirrors (like ""star Trek"" does to the Vulcans); it forces us to tolerate different values, different cultures, and different races or face the genealogy of our ugly prejudices (and their ugly history).",
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Heart of Glory (TV Episode 1988)",Good story with poor attention to the details,"This episode is typical of the early seasons of TNG in that the episode overall is very good, but there is a chronic amount of sloppiness in the writing and the details are so poorly handled that it detracts from what is otherwise a great story.The good: -Great first look (for TNG, anyway) into Klingon culture and Worf's personal history-Though it is irrelevant to the plot, the bit with Geordi's visor is a fascinating look into his character and the technology of the 24th century-Vaughn Armstrong's character is well written and very convincingly charismatic-First reference in TNG to the Romulans (though that leads nowhere...at least for now)-Our first Worf-centric story--the first of many for what is probably the most well-developed character in Star Trek history-A somewhat cool action sequenceThe bad:-Michael Dorn has not yet grown into his character fully, resulting in some poorly-delivered lines. In particular, his dialog in the climactic scene is somewhat cringe-inducing-The action scene, though kind of cool, is also very poorly done. Starfleet officers would NOT have the phasers set to kill in that situation, and their tactics make the Jaffa from Stargate SG-1 look brilliant by comparison. Scenes like this make me think it was wise for TNG to avoid action sequences for the most part in the early seasons.The ugly:-Data says that this is the first time ""outsiders"" have witnessed the Kingon death ritual. I find this to be highly unlikely. The Federation and Klingons have been on more-or-less friendly terms for decades at this point, and the Klingons have been allies with other races at various points in the past, including with the Romulans and with the Ferengi. It's not like the Klingons are a secretive or xenophobic race. And Q knows, they are dying all the time. Just a silly line of dialog, and unnecessary too.-Korris crashing through the glass in engineering after being shot by Worf. People walk and even run on that glass all the time. Why would they make it so flimsy? It's a silly moment that is meant to be dramatic, but just makes me chuckle instead. I'm guessing it is supposed to be a homage to the end of Undiscovered Country when the guy disguised as a Klingon gets shot by Scotty and goes crashing through the glass. The reference is neat, but poorly executed. (EDIT: I realized after writing this that Undiscovered Country didn't come out until four years after this episode so it can't be a reference to that. Which makes the silly scene even worse, unfortunately).-Getting visual on the Klingon ship from many light years away. Data states that the ship is too far away for his sensors to even identify it (even though Klingon designs are very familiar to Starfleet), and yet seconds later they are able to get a visual that is clear enough to make that determination. The range for visual images on the 1701-D seems to be portrayed inconsistently throughout the series, but one thing is for sure, if the human eye could identify the ship, the sensors sure as hell should have been able to.-It bears mentioning again: the Starfleet phasers being set to kill is completely nonsensical and lazy/sloppy writing.Overall a good episode, and great tone-setter for countless future episodes involving Worf, the Klingons, and even the Romulans that will be carried all the way through the Dominion War. 7/10",7

In this episode a trio of renegades has been rescued from a vessel which they have commandeered after causing the deaths of a Klingon vessel. The engines on this ship have been compromised and it blows up. They claim that the empire has sold them out and if they can come up with another ship with the right stuff to fight a war, they will be in business. I wonder which ship they are talking about. One of their brothers dies shortly after arrival and they plot their move. Using all that junk Klingons have hanging from their clothes, they they assemble a weapon and go on a rampage. Before this, they have counseled Worf to join them on their glorious quest and to return to his true being.

8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Heart of Glory (TV Episode 1988)",Getting to Know Worf,"In ""Heart of Glory"" the Enterprise comes across the aftermath of a space battle between an unknown space craft and a Talarian freighter. Puzzlingly, the only survivors are a trio of Klingon warriors. They explain that they were only catching a ride on the freighter but there story doesn't exactly add up. They soon form a bond with Worf. One of them dies from wounds from the battle and we witness a Klingon death ritual.It turns out their story was a lie. The Klingons had stolen the freighter and actually destroyed a Klingon vessel to escape prosecution. Unhappy with the peace treaty with the Federation, the group had hijacked the ship to go on the warpath. A Klingon Bird of Prey shows up to apprehend them and take them to their eventual execution. Worf is torn by his duty to the Federation and his sense of brotherhood with these men. Before Picard can hand them over, the two remaining Klingons escape and kill a pair of security personnel. One is killed in a fire fight.The remaining Klingon heads to the engine room and threatens to blow them all sky high. Worf shows up to talk him off the ledge and eventually kills his fellow Klingon with a phaser. He reports this to the Klingon ship captain who tells the Enterprise to dispose of the bodies as they see fit.I'm glad Worf finally got some screentime and backstory. He is really good here and it's interesting how the writers decided to characterize him as a Klingon outsider with ties to humanity and the Federation but that animalistic urge present in Klingons. He reminds me a lot of Spock in the sense that he's torn between two cultures and must suppress emotions (obviously to a different degree than a Vulcan).I think this is the tightest and best script we've seen on TNG this far and definitely the best episode. All those shots aboard the wrecked freighter are super cool. Most of the characters get a fair amount of scenes (except for Troi) and time to develop their character further. And we get a fun thought experiment on nature versus nurture. Worf is a Klingon and has Klingon tendencies but wasn't raised as such. He has a constant internal struggle on which path to take. Here his human side wins out but he's still able to pay homage to his Klingon side.Just like the Bird of Prey's captain says at the end, the Klingon world could learn a lot from Word and vice versa.",8

But Vaughn Armstrong and David Froman playing the fugitive Klingons have a great influence on Worf and he's tempted to join them. These two do not like the Federation/Klingon alliance and want to go out and do battle with just about anyone.This is the episode where we first learn about Michael Dorn's background and how Worf came to join Star Fleet.

It's intended to get them to buy, but instead it attacks them without any sort of safety protocol.I wish the episode would spend more time on the details, or at least give us some additional made up gobbledygook verbiage!I didn't understand how the weapon system drones could transform into human holograms and back to their hover-craft form. Are they pure energy? Do the machines go invisible while they project a hologram?I was lost at the beginning and I thought the ending was a bit too easy. It has some imaginative SF elements and is well worth watching, but I thought it could have been better thought out.**Spoilers Probable Past Here**Picard and Dr. Crusher join the away team when Riker is caught in a field of energy. While Picard is away, he leaves Geordi in command. Geordi must make difficult decisions, encourage youthful crew members, and show leadership in the face of a skeptical and fretful (higher ranking) engineer.Picard and Dr. Crusher bond after Crusher falls and injuries herself. We find out some background history of Crusher and that her mother taught her herbal remedies. Data shows more of his great ability by jumping many feet down to rescue Picard/Crusher.The defense system has many parts, which appear somewhat disconnected and somewhat networked. It sends out a small hover craft that shoots phaser blasts. The hover craft either transforms or projects a hologram intelligence gatherer (it could project a hologram if it has invisibility like its orbital model). The defense system has another invisible craft in space to fight off any ships in orbit. And it has an underground computer and manufacturing center that tracks enemy activities and constructs new hover craft models.Picard discovers the defense system controls and its hologram salesman. The finale seemed a bit easy and forced. I was left wondering why the defense system got so out of control when it was seemingly so easy to turn off. Did Picard just get lucky?And, why oh why, doesn't the orbital defense system disable after the buy is made? Is it too far away to receive the message to disable?I thought the ending was a bit too easy and it didn't answer any of my questions.",
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Arsenal of Freedom (TV Episode 1988)",The Arsenal of Freedom,"""Arsenal of Freedom"" is pure awesomeness. Lt. Geordi LaForge gets to sit in the hotseat as Picard, Dr. Crusher, Commander Riker, Lt. Commander Data, and Security Officer Yar are on a planet with a history of supplying weapons for war. No human lifeforms, just advanced weaponry the Enterprise crew has never encountered left to contend with. Both the Enterprise and those on the ground have to deal with superior weaponry, and how to get out of dodge will be top priority for all involved. Picard and Crusher fall into a hole while flying machines fire laser blasts towards the away team. Each machine they destroy, the next is improved; Riker and company know that they cannot continue to do battle with them because eventually their phasers will have no effect. Meanwhile, LaForge must tolerate an officer from Engineering challenging his authority while having to deal with a weapon with cloaking capabilities, slowly deteriorating the Enterprise's shields the longer they remain in orbit of the planet. This episode really exhilarates me because it such a refreshing change of pace; Picard goes down to the planet, Crusher (who suffers lacerations, bruises, and broken bones thanks to the fall; how Picard survived unscathed is anybody's guess) is the one who needs tending to, and Geordi decides to separate the saucer driving the battle section back to the planet, keeping the 1000 people from certain doom if the Enterprise were to remain in orbit. The solution to the entire ordeal is a hoot because it is so ridiculously simple and a nearly unconscious Crusher comes up with it out of the blue! Vincent Schiavelli (Ghost) is hilarious as a ""projected salesman"", a ""peddler program"" used by the now extinct Minos people to sell weaponry, killed off by the very machine they built. He actually helps Picard figure out the machine's weaknesses and understand how it works. This is Geordi's finest moment (and he had some good ones in the coming seasons as Chief Engineer, but this was his turn to shine; I would be shocked if this wasn't Levar Burton's favorite episode, or at least one of his favorites), getting to command, sit in the Captain's chair, and what he is saddled with is quite a responsibility/burden. Seeing young con personnel and a game Worf going to battle with Geordi (okay, granted, it is against a similar machine that you see on the ground of the planet, but its cloak and dagger routine is quite difficult for even the most seasoned Captains, appearing, disappearing, and reappearing) is really a thrill. You don't see the saucer separating very much but when it does, the episode really needs to deliver something of note and this one does feature Geordi, taking solid advice from the wisdom of Troi, leading the nervous officers with confidence and level-headedness. Just a great episode altogether, with lots of action, survival strategies, and difficult challenges for all of the principle characters. There is a bit of mourning for me inside because this is really a fine example of why Denise Crosby's decision to leave the show (just two episodes later, Skin of Evil would feature the Yar character's demise) was the wrong one because she is right in the thick of it on the ground, helping to dictate the next move against those pesky laser machines.",9

Riker bumps into the captain of the previous vessel but quickly realized there's something off about him. It turns out to be a hologram trying to glean information on the Enterprise's firepower. When Riker becomes an uncooperative interogee, a nearby drone puts him in some kind of stasis field for further questioning later. Crusher and Picard beam down to try to free him.The away team is soon attacked by a drone which they eventually destroy but not before being split up. Crusher and Picard fall down into a pit where Crusher is seriously wounded. Data, Yar, and Riker's communicators aren't working and must traverse the surface on foot looking for Crusher and Picard.Meanwhile on the bridge, Geordi's in command. The Enterprise is being attacked by a cloaked vessel seemingly impossible to fight back against. They can't beam up the away team and Geordi is stuck between a rock and a hard place: stick around and possibly get destroyed or abandon the crew down on the planet and flee.Geordi and the chief engineer get into a bit of an argument. Finally Geordi decided to disconnect the saucer and have the engineer take everyone to a nearby base while Geordi and a small crew fight back on the battle bridge. They head down into the atmosphere and use air disturbance to locate their adversary and destroy it.Back on the planet, Data, Riker, and Yar have had to deal with evolving drones that through AI improve with each iteration. The away team might have met its match as the newest drone might be too powerful for them. Luckily, down in the pit Picard has discovered the super-computer running the drone. It's intended as a showcase to sell the weapons the planet's species used to be peddling. Picard tells a hologram that they'll buy the weapons system if the computer will turn off the demonstration. The drone disappears and their communicators start to function again. They all beam up to safety and head off to find the rest of the detached ship.Science fiction tends to be better when it has a deeper message. That might sound a bit self-evident but I think people forget that sometimes. This story serves as a warning to our current military situation happening in the world. The usage of AI and automation in the world's ever-advancing weaponry make for a scary combination. Even back in the 80's, the writers could see the writing on the wall. There are unmanned drone strikes occurring all over the world as we speak. The drones we see in this episode aren't that farfetched. Technology will only continue to improve...",7

Another familiar face to appear here is that of Merritt Butrick as T'Jon - he was David, the son of James T. Kirk in the Star Trek movies II: The Wrath of Khan and III: The Search For Spock.

So it stands to reason that once something has been transported, there is now a record of what it's made of. So once the ""medicine"" was beamed on board (then again to the cargo hold) making more would be a simple matter.

In this case, the Enterprise becomes involved with two societies--two that are locked in an inextricable trade relationship. One planet provides a needed drug and the other planet will do just about anything to get it---and it's been this way for over 200 years. The problem is that although folks THINK the drug is to cure some space illness, there is a secret the drug providers aren't telling the other planet--the illness disappeared long ago and the 'medicine' is a super-refined and very addictive drug. So, in essence, the one planet is the drug dealer and the other planet is a planet of junkies. This is morally reprehensible and Doctor Crusher wants to put a stop to it. BUT, Jean-Luc is a firm believer in the Prime Directive--and doing anything would violate their non-interference laws. So, they can violate the Prime Directive or uphold it--neither of which is a good choice. So what's next?This is a pretty decent episode. Not great but well done and worth seeing.

6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Symbiosis (TV Episode 1988)",Symbiosis,"There are little episodes like ""Symbiosis"" sprinkled throughout the series (particularly the first two) that often go unheralded, and I guess that's because we as fans have to rewatch and, in turn, reevaluate how good they really are. It is nice to come across strongly written episodes like this one, rediscover them, and see the points within their stories. This tale involves two worlds, similar alien people, the greedy, underhanded Brekkians and the vulnerable, technologically/intelligently inferior Onarians, involving a narcotic known as Felicium. While investigating an unusual sun, the Enterprise encounters an old freighter, operated by four Onarians who know very little about their own ship's mechanics (!), who have Brekkian traders on board with them. The freighter has a minor problem with coils that could be easily replaceable if only those on board knew how to install them! Beaming four of the six of them aboard the Enterprise, Picard becomes entangled in a dispute over the Felicium and the Prime Directive becomes an important factor in his inability to get involved. Dr. Crusher (the episode excellently pits her in a tug-of-war philosophically and emotionally with Picard over allowing the Onarians to be exploited by the Brekkians simply for profit) wants Picard to inform the Onarians of the lie that continues to engulf their people (this is a symbiotic relationship between two peoples that has lasted for a long time), while he is unable to do so under the guidelines of the Directive, and this episode examines why it is important not to interfere, but instead the Captain brilliantly figures out another way of possibly ending such a lop-sided alliance between them—in his own way Picard must also exploit the Onarians, using their lack of technological know-how, and lack of advancement over the centuries, in order to help them ""wane off"" the Felicium. This is definitely a ""message episode"" about the exploitation of addicts for pure financial gain and how the United Federation of Planets must abide by the rules that govern their ability to function in the universe. Good episode for the character of Crusher and the passion of Gates McFadden, her sympathy for a fooled society, wrings true in the performance.The agony is palpable in the way Merritt Butrick and Judson Earney Scott convey their Felicium dependency, a good description on aching for a drug. Some find the dialogue scene, where the young man ponders to Data about why anyone would succumb to drug use, between Wil Wheaton's Wesley and Denise Crosby's Yar annoying, but I think it does allow a moment to examine the allure and pitfalls of narcotic abuse (and it gives Crosby one last character moment before Yar's departure in Skin of Evil). I think it is unfortunate Crosby decided to leave because barely a season worth of episodes never quite allowed her to fully flesh out the character, in my opinion, definitely a shame.",8

Picard communicates with its captain and quickly learns how uninformed and confused this T'Jon character is. The ship's crew seems to have no idea how the ship operates, nor do they seemingly care that much about their own well-being. The crew beams over with a crate full of ""medicine"" just as the ship explodes. The rescuees turn out to be from two neighboring races: the Ornarans & Brekkians. The Ornarans are pale and sickly with the Brekkians seem much more healthy.Crusher does some research on the ""medicine"" and comes to the conclusion that it's a narcotic. The Brekkians entire economy is built upon producing it and selling it to their planetary neighbors. They know it's not medicine but the entire Ornaran planet is so addicted that the cycle won't stop without something changing.Doctor Crusher pleads with Picard to let her detox the Ornarans and find them a way back to normalcy. Before all this they were on the path to having warp drive, now their last working ship is inoperable. Picard refuses as this would violate his interpretation of the Prime Directive.But Picard also refuses to repair the Ornarans ships. Since the Brekkians haven't figured out space travel, there will be no way for them to transport the drug between planets. After this last batch, the Ornarans will soon suffer withdrawals. It will be hard, says Picard, but soon they'll be on the right path again.We have some interesting ethical dilemmas happening here for Picard but boy is the drug metaphor here heavy-handed! This is right smackdab in the midst of the 80's war on drugs and it shows. Yar's speech is so preachy I thought I'd wandered into a Sunday School lesson. It's written with the subtly of a freight train.It had potential to be interesting if they played around a bit more with Picard's ethical responsibility. I'm not sure I agree with his interpretation of the Prime Directive. You can make the argument that Picard shouldn't interfere with the two planets symbiotic relationship, I get that. As much as Crusher wants to help, I think she would be violating it. However, repairing ships that already exist and at one time functioned does not seem to violate the rules. He's not helping them progress artificially, he's fixing ships their race made! If the Federation couldn't dish out replacement parts everytime somebody got a flat tire, what would be the point of them interacting with other cultures at all?I think Picard warped the rules a bit here to get what him and Doc Crusher wanted without being too overt. At the end of the day though, I think it's a mistake from the perspective of the letter of the law the Federation has created.",5

An interesting decision by Picard to withhold aid due to the Prime Directive, which he so flagrantly disregarded on Edo (though I am, of course, glad that Wil Wheaton is still alive!). Also, there is an interesting, surprisingly never addressed (in the show or on any wiki that I could find), implication of the ending. The two Brekkans are now trapped on Ornara since Picard refuses to repair the Ornaran spacecraft, and the Ornarans are currently too hopped up/strung out to do it themselves (Ornara was the only one of the two planets to develop space travel).

Will Picard use the resources and knowledge of Star Fleet to force human morality onto an alien culture? Is it right for a more technologically advanced civilization to interfere with the development of lesser developed civilizations? The Brekkians seem to be an uncaring and aloof people judging by the two of them on the cargo ship. They could care less about saving their fellow crew members and care more for their cargo of felicium. They claim that felicium is a lifesaving medicine.But the Ornarans claim possession of the felicium until the Brekkians pay the agreed price.We are then sent on a few red-herrings that I won't spoil, but the dispute raises the question of whether Picard should break the Prime Directive and help the Brekkians. Dr. Crusher argues that he should and appeals to Picard's emotions.Some of the SF/Fantasy elements include the use of alien transporters to get a lock and help beam them over to the Enterprise. I'm still confused because it doesn't seem necessary since they end up beaming them over without anyways.Another interesting idea is that the Ornarans are completely devoted to producing one product: felicium. The Ornarans are not sick in any way, so they regularly sell the felicium to the Brekkians. The Brekkians therefore provide the Ornarans with everything they need. Thus the title of the episode.This episode made me notice that Picard often makes a few aside comments to his crew while inter-cutting his comments with official remarks to another ship. How does the computer know who he's talking too? Does it shut off when he turns to talk to his crew and then turn back on when he slightly raises his voice and looks at the view screen to talk to the other ship? It annoys me a bit, but it isn't specific to this episode.Lovers of the Prime Directive will like this episode, but I won't say much more about how it's depicted since it seems like anything I say will spoil it too much.I recommend watching this episode as its a very worthy Star Trek idea.",
10,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Symbiosis (TV Episode 1988)",Frustrating misunderstanding of the prime directive.,"This episode was frustrating because they used the prime directive as a weak plot device to avoid telling an entire planet of people they were being exploited by a people on a different planet. First of all, they technically had space travel and were going to help them fix their ships and everything. Then when they figure out that one of the planets is being exploited they say they can't tell them because it would force ""earth morals"" or something due to some interpalenetary agreement (which I'm not sure really is the prime directive, but they switch between using this and the prime directive as excuses). The writers felt that it would be interesting to tie the enterprise's hands and have to try to figure out a way to give the Ornarans a shot at figuring it out themselves. I Believe it would be much more interesting if they told them and the Ornarans didn't believe them and they had to find ways to try to prove it to them. That would have been much more interesting. It could have been made to be just as frustrating and dissatisfying of an ending (by having the Ornarans refusing to believe them by the end) if that's what they were going for. It would have made much more logical sense. The whole idea of one planet secretly exploiting another is very interesting and I think they almost made this episode very good. I just haven't seen the prime directive used as anything other than a lazy plot device by this point in the series, so it's rather annoying to have it in there at all.",5

Most of the first two seasons of this show are barely watchable, this is one them.

0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Skin of Evil (TV Episode 1988)",Un-complicated Review - A great episode,"Previous reviews seem to be from fanatics who are original series purists and are not objective at all. This episode is perhaps one of the great episodes of the TNG series. Never mind all of the mumbo jumbo about the writers' and producers' intent, the STORY is an excellent portrayal of good versus evil. Never in the Star Trek universe have our heroes encountered a creature as purely evil as Armus. As a matter of fact, the primitive set and props has exactly the feel of the original Star Trek and the situation is one that explores the very depths of the human psyche the way that Roddenberry's original Star Trek explored many issues in human life. An excellent episode if you see it for what it is - an EPISODE! and not try to judge it for how it ""fits"" into the Star Trek universe.",9
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Skin of Evil (TV Episode 1988)",A meaningless death.,"ST:TNG:22 - ""Skin Of Evil"" (Stardate: 41601.3) - this is the 22nd episode to go into production but the 23rd episode to air on TV. This is a pivotal episode for the series because of a death of one of the main characters. Though I won't give away who, let's just say it was a meaningless death, as will be noted later on in the series. Of course the main reason a main character died is because that person wanted out of their contract and was granted that. Also, it should be noted that Lt. Worf is also made acting chief of security, a position he will hold for the rest of the series, and that Troi mentions the word ""Imzadi"" again. All in all, this is really one of the sadder of the TNG episodes.",
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Skin of Evil (TV Episode 1988)","""All that rage...""","You can easily say this is crucial turning point in first season of TNG, where we have death of one of the main characters of the series. I know many people will refer to this episode as the ""one where Tasha left"" and the subplot won't matter that much. Though many will argue this episode is here just to justify Denise Crosby leaving the series, somehow I found that without it, the ""Skin of Evil"" wouldn't have the impact it carries now.First and foremost - this is a great portrait of evil in it's core, a result of what happens when all of the sadness, rage, anger, disappointment have been suppressed long enough to kill all the goodness inside. Armus is the essence of a ""scorned castaway"" who turns to pure evil after being eaten away by desire for revenge in probably eons that he was left behind. And even though he is nothing but evil entity that toys with Enterprise crew just as he was toyed with by those who left him behind, and even though he kills a someone of the crew that became so dear to us, we cannot but feel sorry for what he's gone through and what has made him what he is now. By the time Enterprise leaves you wish they somehow found the way to kill him just to release him from this dreadful state. This is exactly the dramatical and emotional climax this episode delivers.The end sequence in holodeck of memorial for Tasha, with almost heavenly feel in image of green grassy slope and clear blue skies with fluffy clouds is simply breathtaking. That image was stuck in my head ever since I watched this episode as kid, and reflecting on it now - I'm sorry they didn't make more emotional highpoints in the series as this. Yes, Tasha may have died, but you feel she didn't die in vain, and all the time they spent together won't be forgotten.",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Skin of Evil (TV Episode 1988)",Better than people give it credit for,"This episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" was a hard one to do both physically and emotionally. It was emotionally straining for the cast and crew because of the death of main character Natasha ""Tasha"" Yar (Denise Crosby), and it was physically straining do to it being hard to create the creature of Armus (the late Ron Gans) and make him believable. Why do I bring both of these points up? Well, this was an episode that had everything running against it, yet it still succeeded.After Counselor Tori's (Marina Sirtis) shuttle crashes on a planet and the crew cannot beam her and the pilot out, an away-team is dispatched to rescue them. Upon their arrival the away-team is met by a stream of black goo that keeps moving to block their access to the shuttle and its survivors. The black goo turns out to be a creature by the name of Armus, who wants to watch people suffer for his amusement. Lieutenant Yar becomes fed up with the creature and tries to pass it, only for Armus to quickly kill her. The creature proceeds to torment the crew, swallowing Riker (Jonathan Frakes), and taking control of Data (Brent Spiner) to attempt to make him kill a fellow crew mate. When the crew is gone, he is confronted by Troi and we learn the reasons behind why Armus is the way he is. He was left behind by people and now he just wants to witness torment.The episode has received harsh criticism towards it, mainly from the death of Lieutenant Yar and the creature of Armus himself. As I said earlier, this episode had a lot going against it, and it managed to pull through.While a main character, I felt Lieutenant Yar's death was a fitting end to her character as she died in a similar manner as the red shirts from ""Star Trek: The Original Series"". The only difference here is that Lieutenant Yar was a main character that we had grown to know while the red shirts were cannon fodder to begin with. The creature of Armus was a tricky creature to create, but when it was all done, I feel that all the work payed off. Armus looked real had a menacing appearance. The scenes with him and Troi were nice because we actually got to see why he was making the crew of the 'Enterprise' suffer for his pleasure of viewing it. The only problem is that for a character who did something as big as kill off a main character, he is not all that memorable considering some of the other characters who did less that the 'Enterprise' crew encountered, such as Admiral Jameson (Clayton Rohner) who had been taking medication to become younger.The ending of the episode with Yar's funeral was emotional and well executed. You can argue that it makes no sense how Yar knew where each member of the crew was going to be ahead of time so she could look at them when she said how they meant to her, but it all works to set the mood. When everything is over, this is probably the most emotional scene in ""Star Trek"" I have ever watched.""Skin of Evil"" is a thrilling and emotional episode of ""Star Trek"", with good looking effects for the villain. While the episode is a bit bogged down by the fact that Armus is not too memorable considering what he does in the episode, it is still a good episode.",
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Skin of Evil (TV Episode 1988)",Skin of Evil,"No goodbyes. Just good memories. Well it was inevitable. I have fought and fought watching ""Skin of Evil"" but putting it off any longer would be futile. Getting it over with is the best option. Part of me hates ""Skin of Evil"". Part of me is angry with Denise Crosby and those involved with Star Trek: The Next Generation for killing off Yar when it wasn't necessary. Why not find another way to have Yar exit the show for a possible return in the future? Ugh, it leaves me disappointed and just angry. Putting those unpleasant feelings aside, the skin of evil in this episode, the slick mass that looks like a puddle of gelatin, his devious, darkly sinister voice, is quite a creepy presence and the lack of compassion or morality makes it a definite force to be reckoned with. Yar's departure leaves a lasting feeling of loss while trying to focus on the plot is difficult. The show really hums when Picard engages the Skin, actually stirring his rage as a means to save a downed shuttlecraft (with an injured Troi on board) by beaming them up when its anger is at its peak. Vagras II will always be looked at as the place where Tasha Yar's life was ended for no reason other than to possibly amuse an evil creature whose very essence was discarded by an ancient race who wished to free themselves from that destructiveness that comes from within. Seems like Yar's life should've ended with more of a purpose, but I guess that's the pointsometimes a person dies in an event on some insignificant planet during a routine rescue operation. Too bad, because Yar was the kind of human warrior who deserved better. Probably the most disturbing scene has Riker ""enveloped"" by the evil skin, his life hanging in the balance, paraded psychologically by Armus to antagonize Deanna. The skin doesn't seem to have the characteristics of what it is to be a lifeform yet has intelligence and can shape itself into a humanoid form (still gelatinous, giving it a menacing look that is certainly memorable). Still, I couldn't help feel this was all designed just to kill off Yar and give Picard and his away team a little struggle before the big finale allows the holographic image of Tasha to address her friends and colleagues one last time, telling each one what they meant to her, one last memorial in honor of a fallen member of the Enterprise crew. This episode, once Yar's life is declared expired by Beverly in a throat-gulping scene that tears you up inside, has plenty of Armus toying with the away team, trying and failing to amuse itself whether it be have Geordi try to locate his visors or Data forced to point his phaser at his crew members. Trying to get into the episode, though, was (and has always been) difficult.I must say that this episode leaves me frustrated and a little down because I believed Yar had so much potential if Crosby had just stuck it out a little while longer. Strong female characters in the Trek universe were always welcomed by me and Yar was quite an example of this archetype. Admittedly, I had more than a little trepidation watching this episode again as I know how I felt in the past after watching it...it just reinforces my belief that Yar could've be quite a character. Sigh.",5
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Skin of Evil (TV Episode 1988)",One of the Best,"Joseph Stefano has written some of the best science fiction ever seen on TV, and he's created a masterpiece here. ""Skin of ""Evil"" is a fascinating story, with a creepy, intelligent, sadistic ""villain"" (Armus) and the rule-breaking death of a main character. It includes some of the best dialogue in TV history. When the crew tells Armus that they try to protect life, he asks ""Why?"" Simple, yet brilliant. He somehow knows Data is an android and sarcastically calls him ""robot"" and ""Tin Man."" He taunts Geordi by shuffling his visor around on the ground out of arm's reach (I couldn't help but let out a belly-laugh at that). Only Stefano could fully realize a creature so convincingly evil -- yet human (which is ironic since Armus is actually the worst part of, and was discarded by, a ""race of titans""). To those who find Armus ""silly""and the episode ""weak,"" I suggest you revisit it when you've matured -- probably around age 50.",10
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Skin of Evil (TV Episode 1988)","Mediocre episode, but it did us all a huge favor","This episode was troubled from the get-go and many re-writes were made before the final one, which allowed Denise Crosby to make her early exit from the series. In doing so, she did the series and its fans a huge favor by removing her one-dimensional character and one-dimensional acting from the series. This allowed Michael Dorn's character of Worf to assume her role and greatly expand it and the series's potential.Other than giving us a baddie to boo/hiss, this episode had no definitive plot and existed for no reason other than to show Tasha Yar the door, for which I and many others were grateful.",4

Denise Crosby wanted off the Enterprise (dissatisfied with her character's development), to which the producers respond by killing her off. So Tasha Yar gets blasted not ten minutes in by a black sludge monster. I dunno, that just sounds like an overt statement. A character can be killed off with purpose - saving the crew, the ship - but no. One minute, she's standing there with the rest of the away team, the next she's killed off like a red shirt. It's meaningless. Even that guy Ben on the shuttle survived and we *never* see him again!And it'd help if a decent episode resulted from this, but it's pretty lame. I can see they were going for a simple good-vs-evil story here, but there's no substance to it. And then it's off to the holodeck for Yar's funeral . . . where she has a pre-recorded sugary speech prepared. Yeah, that's not weird. The whole damn scene is awkward, and the only good thing that comes out of this is that it indirectly paves the way for 'Yesterday's Enterprise'.4/10",4

Armus can talk, move around, and take a few black-liquid shapes. But Data and the crew can't understand how it does any of these things; it doesn't have normal signs of life.Apparently, Armus was created by an unknown species (the Titans) who emptied all their evil and negative traits into a second skin to shed away. Armus is what remains of this second skin, and Armus is not very happy about being abandoned.Armus has great power and talks like a mischievous egoistic villain! Yes, I love to parrot its evil voice for the whole episode. But there are a few interesting tidbits about the Star Trek world. (1) We learn that the Enterprise has a martial arts competition. Yar is training for it and the crew is betting on the winners. (2) An engineer, Lynch, re-aligns the dilithium crystals manually when Picard tells him he can't wait for the required 20 minutes to safely align the crystals. Picard seems to dangerously risk the entire ship just to get to one of his crew members. (3) It also makes use of the holodeck in an interesting way.I always wonder whether the final holographic conversations make any sense. Were they pre-recorded predictions or holographic A.I.? They seem strange in the context of the episode. In any case, I'll keep silent on them since it may spoil it too much.I refuse to discuss the absurdities of Armus.

Picard basically negs Armus into a rage and the remaining away team beam up and blast off, quarantining the planet from future exploration. The group gathers in the holodeck and watches a pre-recorded message from Yar in the event of her death.This would be nothing more than a sub-par Season 1 episode if it weren't for Yar's death. I think people sometimes equate importance with excellence. This isn't a good episode of television. If you remove Yar's death from this it's completely forgettable and honestly pretty bad. The only reason I'm giving it a 5 is its importance to everyone's character arcs. Armus is laughable as the cartoonish villain. He's like the embodiment of an edgy 14 year old on the internet. Do you really expect me to believe he's made of 100% pure, unfiltered evil?This could be just me, but I like to believe he was lying about his back story to everyone. He made up an alter ego to sound cool in front of these new people. In actuality he's just an evolved tar pit or something. The claim that he's sentient evil is straight up ridiculous.I knew Yar's demise was coming but I expected more from this episode... It's honestly a pretty bad send-off for an underdeveloped character. I did find it interesting that they killed her 5 minutes in when the classic Hollywood move would be to have that be the finale.",5
10,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Skin of Evil (TV Episode 1988)","A real howler., typical of the first season.","Star Trek TNG is often cited as re-igniting the franchise, taking it onto new plains without losing the core values that Roddenberry worked to create in The Original Series. While in later seasons the writing would improve and finally match the strong abilities of the main cast, the first season is routinely derided for being weak; a mere rehash of old ideas and extraneous plots introduced to waste time. This episode is somewhere between those points, with the added embarrassment of a needless death.The premise of the show is standard Trek fare; a shuttlecraft carrying Ensign Ricky Redshirt and a main cast member - in this case the voluptuous Deanna Troi - crash lands on a planet and requires rescue. The attempt is then impeded by an indigenous lifeform. Rather than an interesting villain of some description, the main cast spend most of their time on a poorly designed 'Planet Hell' set talking to a poorly-animated tar pit with an ugly duckling complex.Even this terrible concept could have been enlivened by some cracking dialogue, but no, the writers were more than happy to stick to hapless cliché and stilted exposition here. Plot holes are obvious - how did Troi survive for the amount of time depicted in the episode stranded on a shuttle with no replicator, for example? The few redeeming moments of the whole sorry proceeding are within the Yar's eulogy scene, where Denise Crosby speaks for Yar and describes her love and respect for the remaining cast and Brent Spiner has the opportunity to develop Data's character. It is partly this closeness between the cast that led to the 'classic' episodes later on in the show's run.",5

I have no idea why they killed her off...but it was a good thing for the show because her character was so one-dimensional and I was tired about hearing about the rape gangs (this actually seemed to trivialize rape). So, on the positive side, this episode signals the death of Tasha Yar...at least for a while. On the bad, she does return (of sorts) and the episode itself very, very talky and schmaltzy at the end.

As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 01A promising start for the series, where cases may come and go, but the chemistry among the cast is what amps up the charge, with background still kept under the shades and just skimming off the surface of their equations, the makers have managed to tease us and hook us from the first adventure itself.Skin Of EvilA bit poignant chapter that is emotionally fueled and yet fails to cast a spell due to its poor execution, although the entire social rigmarole of this enterprise shines a new light as tears roll down their faces.",

In fact next generation had a double roll with the very next episode ""Conspiracy"".Of course the last few episodes of season one lacked the appearance of Denise Crosby as Tasha Yar- Who I admit I did not like in season one but I actually liked a lot more when she appeared in ""yesterday's enterprise"" and then later as Sela, the daughter of that alternate Tasha. And those future episodes of course also dealt with time and/or alternate time-lines. When we watch episodes like this, we start to wonder if time is as immutable as we think it is.",10

7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" We'll Always Have Paris (TV Episode 1988)",A Ghost from Picard's Past,"In ""We'll Always Have Paris"" the Enterprise receives a distress call from a renowned scientist and his lab where the scientist has made a big breakthrough in the field of time's relationship to alter dimensions but has fallen ill. The only other survivor at this lab after a bad mishap is the wife of Dr. Manheim who also just happens to be an old flame of Picard's who he abandoned in favor of Star Fleet.The Enterprise starts having strange time glitches and do-overs. Apparently the sick Dr. Manheim has opened up a seam to another dimension which has 1) made him sick and 2) had long stretching percussions around this corner of the galaxy. Data's understanding of the situation means he must beam down the lab and close up the seam with instructions he receives from Manheim. As Picard tries to deal with this issue, he also must deal with the skeletons in his closet regarding Jenice and what could have been in another life.This episode was plodding and felt like one of the longest episodes of Season 1. If time truly is not constant as Data talks about, then this episode was about twice as long as some of the better Season 1 eps. The only scene I really enjoyed was Data trying to sew up the tear and 3 of him show up. Beyond that, there's not much to like. The Paris scenes on the Holodeck all look pretty bad. None of the characters really shine here. While not the worst we've seen in Season 1, it's somewhere near the bottom.",3
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" We'll Always Have Paris (TV Episode 1988)",the real reason you left..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 01A promising start for the series, where cases may come and go, but the chemistry among the cast is what amps up the charge, with background still kept under the shades and just skimming off the surface of their equations, the makers have managed to tease us and hook us from the first adventure itself.We'll Always Have ParisExploring a love affair of Stewart's past, the story has a new angle to it, but wait there's a catch, Stewart puts his shields down and that is when the episode grooves smoothly on the floor, while the rest of it fumbles poorly.",

As for the other, it is decent...but nothing to get excited about either. Overall, it left me very flat.The Enterprise notices a space wrinkle where things repeat themselves for an instant. This distortion is investigated--and it takes the ship right in the path of a woman who Picard abandoned many years ago in order to go to space. Michelle Phillips stars as the woman and this part of the show isn't bad. But the time distortion is so very dull and uninteresting. It really was just an excuse to bring Picard and his old flame together--and it should have been a lot better.

Cmdr. Dexter Remmick as the ""conspiracy"" proposed in that episode is brought to full force here. The conspiracy turns out to be real and Picard decides to take the Enterprise back to Earth (the first time to see Earth in TNG) to confront the very heart of the matter. Won't give away the details but the ""conspiracy"" was meant to be a new threat to the Federation but didn't pan out (you don't see the conspirators in future episodes of TNG, DS9, VOY or ENT). And this is probably one of the gorier of Star Trek episodes. See it to believe it.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Conspiracy (TV Episode 1988)",Great stuff,"After reading HNSampat-2's review, I had to respond. Sampat writes that the episode should be disowned, but it's the 39th best rated TNG episode out of 176 on IMDb. It's the highest rated episode out of the first season. And if we consider the people who are taking the effort to rate each episode, it's obvious that it's the fans who think it deserves a 7.9.So I put it to you Sampat - how is it not Star Trek? That's a load of rubbish. This show made Star Trek what it is today.And this episode DOES relate to space. In fact, it's a prelude to what should have been a future space adventure episode relating to these beings. Instead they were replaced by the Borg.The episode is very enjoyable. There's some dodgy direction in the fight scenes, but outside of that it's a joy to see the actors begin to gel with their characters. I could always remember this episode from when I was younger due to the beeping of the beacon sent out - chilling stuff.Also, watch out for horror specialist Michael Berryman (Pluto in The Hills Have Eyes) making a guest appearance. 9/10",9

However, it's such a HUGE departure from the usually overly cerebral episodes of season one that it's a welcome breath of fresh air!A few episodes back, an admiral and his henchman, a commander, were introduced (""Coming of Age"") and at the time, why they were in the first episode seemed a bit unclear. Here, the final portion of that story is about to play out in ""Conspiracy"". It seems that Starfleet has been behaving oddly and several other Federation captains have called Picard to a secret meeting to discuss this. They are not sure what is happening--but SOMETHING is afoot. They warn Picard to be on his guard. This paranoia seems well founded when shortly after the meeting adjourns, one of the captains' ships explodes! Obviously SOMETHING is happening. What? See the show.This is good old senseless paranoia and violence--things that made the original ""Star Trek"" series so much fun. And this episode is indeed fun--something the series occasionally forgot to include and a welcome relief here. This is the one to see during the first season.",10

Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean-Luc Picard and Jonathan Frakes as Commander William T. Riker get some action scenes and Henry Darrow as Savar along with the other seasoned guest cast offer some weight to the proceedings, even when eating maggoty looking grub worms.There's a memorable scene where Picard has a secret meeting oozing suspicion and conspiracy with other captains, notable is Hills have Eyes' Michael Berryman as Captain Rixx. There also some comic relief where Enterprise's computer becomes frustrated with Data. It's another dialogue driven episode that Bole breaks up with intermittent phaser action, glass tables and icky alien close ups.While the stunt doubles stand out like a sore thumb and the parasites CGI and design is questionable, this if offset by a Scanners-like exploding head, blasted phaser body remains and a mother alien creature design that deliver some thrills in a slow first season.Overall, an interesting episode with enough protruding gills and creature swallowing to possibly creep out the casual viewer.",
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Conspiracy (TV Episode 1988)",Creepy!,"'Conspiracy' is a refreshingly well-done episode and certainly my favorite of the first season.

Those brain parasites, it's like he writers took the Ceti eel bit from ""The Wrath of Khan"" and spun it into a conspiracy flick (and threw in some xenomorph action from ""Alien"" for good measure.It's deadly serious, though not so much that we can't enjoy seeing an old guy beating the crap out of Riker (and Worf even more quickly). And it shows that Captain Picard will risk his career for a friendship. The plot's twisty, the tone sinister and the ending is surprisingly dark. Great stuff.8/10",8
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Conspiracy (TV Episode 1988)",The genesis of the Borg?,"This has long been one of my favorite episodes.And I've long wondered if this episode didn't have some influence on the Borg plot-lines. After all, both alien species' M.O. is basically the same: instead of political conquest, ""conquer"" the enemy at the individual level. To reverse a cliché, ""If you can't beat 'em, make 'em join you."" Of course, the very last episode of S1, foreshadows ""Q Who?"" et al, tho' we're given no information as to who destroys the Federation and Romulan bases and the thrust of that episode, of course, is the ""return"" of the Romulans after decades of isolation.Back on point: Making ""Conspiracy"" a two-parter might have worked, but I'm not sure exactly how. More cloak-and-dagger? Battles between starships controlled by the alien creatures and the Enterprise-D? Discovering compromised members of the ""Enterprise""'s crew (Wesley, perhaps? Been funny to have seen HIM throw Worf around like ""ragdoll."") As it is, I'm sure that the ""Mother Alien"" creature and its death are probably the most expensive single effect shot in the whole seven year series.I do agree that the preceding shot, where the, ah, ""soldier"" aliens are crawling up Remmick's legs is clumsy, certainly by later series standards. But we should always keep in mind that, as with The Original Series, NexGen was done on a relatively low budget--though larger than TOS which was had the lowest budget of any drama during its 1966-69 run.Also, computer animation was in its infancy, Pixar's legendary short, ""Luxo"" had only been created around this time--and the cost was astronomical. it would be the late 90s before computer animation would be advanced enough to realistically replace entire ships, people, aliens, etc.To comment on ewf58's commentary: I've never seen the ""edited"" version of this episode. I believe it was originally broadcast in ""unedited"" form, at least that's my memory. But it's been 22 years...The ""full"" version is on the DVD (S1 D7). And every time I've seen it on syndication, it's been the unedited one.And it is pretty gory. I'm surprised that Roddenberry would have gone that far over 20 yrs ago. Today, such things are seen all the time on TV. ""Battlestar Galactica""'s had some pretty hard core moments. Think of Starbuck stabbing Leoben through the neck on New Caprica; or Caprica Six's murder of the baby in the mini...(Lastly, guess the aliens were sexist, notice that they all refer to each other as ""brother"" and never ""sister""...)",8
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Conspiracy (TV Episode 1988)","In paranoid Delusions ""For Those Who Believe""","This episode starts out as usual-The Enterprise is en-route to ""Pacifica""-Some kind of Pleasure Planet, Troi loosely describes it. Maybe it was one of Gideon Sietek's terraformed worlds (See Deep Space Nine, S2, ""Second Skin"").But this pleasurable interlude is interrupted by a Code 47 transmission from one of Picard's old Friends, Walker Keel (Jonathan Farwell) who has them divert instead to the ""Worthless Chunk of Rock"" Mining Planet Ditalyx B-Where Picard has a tryst with Walker Keel, Tryla Scott (Ursaline Bryant) and the first Bolean we ever see, Captain Ryxx (The Hills Have Eyes' Michael Berryman).Walker has no proof, but he thinks there is a conspiracy in Starfleet Command. But Picard is not going to commit himself yet, although he does agree to keep his eyes open and his back watched.So, The Enterprise D continues on towards Pacifica... Until Worf scans a disturbance in the next sector over, which was of course Keel's ship ""The Horatio"" being blown into tiny chunks. That being too much of a coincidence, Picard lets Riker and the rest of the Bridge Crew in on it, and they all agree to go to Earth. Upon Arrival Starfleet Command immediately contacts them, and one of the Admirals is Picards friend Admiral Quinn (Ward Costello) who had a similar concern about a Conspiracy in an earlier episode. With him is Commander Remick (Robert Schenkkan) who was with Quinn, the Enterprise Crew does not have fond memories of Remick.Quinn asks Picard to be beamed up, but when he gets to the ship, Picard sees right away it's not Quinn: So Picard leaves Riker on the ship and beams down into who knows what.The other two Admirals tell Picard that Keel's Ship imploded. At this time, they ask Picard what he knows about Conspiracies: The Vulcan Admiral plays their existence down, saying ""Conspiracies Only Exist in Paranoid Delusions: 'For Those Who Believe'""- I had originally thought , is this was a jab at the X-Files, but the X-Files were not even being made at the time. Maybe this episode of Trek gave Chris Carter the idea.On the Ship, Quinn tries to Assimilate (He used that word after he had gotten beamed up) Riker with an Alien Parasite. Quinn, an older man, beats the crap out of Riker, Geordi and Worf, only to be stopped by Crusher with a Phaser on ""Kill""- And when they get Quinn to sickbay, they see the parasite on his brain-stem.As Crusher is looking in on Quinn, Riker's hand grabs Crusher: We don't know at that point if Riker had been Assimilated. But at Starfleet, Picard goes to Dinner with the Admirals, who are eating some kind of Mealworms. In walks Tryla Scott, and then we know that the Admirals knew Picard's intentions. Picard tries to leave but it stopped by Riker, who seems to have been taken over.But it was a ruse by Riker to get his phaser down to Star Fleet headquarters, he blasts the admirals, and the Parasites leave their bodies... They chase one of the little buggers into a room, and Remick is sending a Signal somewhere. The Parasite runs right into Remick's mouth and he swallows it!In nearly perfect parody of Picard, Remick, while his NECK bulges in and out, says ""We mean you no Harm-We wish a Peaceful Coexistence""-At that moment WE KNOW, they intend the exact opposite of what Remick has said. So Riker and Picard vaporize the guy and the Alien Queen which rises up out of his headless body.This story was to be linked to The Borg threat, but that idea was dropped due to cost. I think of it as simply a loose End, which will come up to bite Trek on the Arse in some future series which deals with events after the 24th century: Too bad it was never continued, maybe in some way it will be: Comic Book, Novel, or New Series.As it was, this episode refers to Alien, The Puppet Masters, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Invasion, and even the Deep Space Nine S1 episode ""The Passenger"" - It is a subject that has been treated by many Hugo-Award winning Science Fiction writers like Heinlein, Pohl and Silverberg.I'm making this review NOW because I have just watched the Blu-Ray version of this episode, and the visuals are done so well, especially when the Queen rises up from Remick's remains. VERY WELL DONE. I watched this episode in HORROR when it was on Television. It made me jump, a very fine episode.",10

After some research I found this episode and watched it from the point of view of someone who had read ""Unity"", and the correlation was nicely done. It put a face on the parasites and allowed me to imagine them more easily. Naturally the DS9 novel ""Lesser Evil"" (part of the Mission Gamma series of the DS9 relaunch and the book that brought back the parasites) was more effective in describing the effects that the parasite had on the body, from the dead, loathing eyes that had disdain for any other life, to the incredible speed and extremely high tolerance for pain.From that point of view, (or any, to be sure) I liked the episode. While I was doing my research, I also read that it was one of the only episodes of ST to display a warning about the content. (Since I knew halfway what to expect, I was not surprised).

Unsettling episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, right out of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (a movie that has a formula that just flat, simply works), with an ending I'm sure will not only make your skin crawl but perhaps cause goose pimples all up your body. It has an intensely alarming feel to it, this idea that thanks to an invasion from within, Starfleet and the Federation, at the very top, elite level, is being infiltrated by a race of lifeforms that resemble scorpions and attach to the base of the neck, commanding their host organisms (humans/humanoids) to do their bidding. I sensed that this episode, ""Conspiracy"", the next to the last episode of the first season, was built for future story lines but the race, from an uncharted galaxy's planet, discovered accidentally by Starfleet officers, is never addressed on the show again. This has some pretty shocking violence where a head explodes and a stomach burns away to reveal a ""mother"" creature that the creepy crawlies are defendant upon for survival; phasers are put to good use in this episode of The Next Gen. Creepy scenes include the creatures how enter/exit the mouths of host organisms (Starfleet Admirals) and an invaded Admiral (who warned Picard in the past about a ""subversion within Starfleet"") annihilating Riker, Geordi, and Worf with ease (the creatures have a way of strengthening the power of the human body). The return of Lt. Commander Dexter Remmick (Robert Schenkkan), most notable for his antagonizing treatment of the Enterprise crew during an evaluation of how the ship functions in ""Coming of Age"", is less of a factor, practically window dressing until his rather haunting fate at the end of this episode. Admiral Quinn (Ward Costello) was also last seen in ""Coming of Age"", this time completely under the control of one of the parasitic creatures, subdued only thanks to Crusher's phaser set at a high frequency. A trick involving Riker in order to move about the invaded Admirals is quite neat, but the results of stopping them are a bit too easy. The homing beacon conclusion left open a possible return of the parasites but this storyline was abandoned, a mistake, I believe...the use of the sound of the beacon as the show closes raised the hair on my neck, for sure. The debris depicting the destruction of the USS Horatio, commanded by Picard's old friend (Walker had sent Picard a high-priority code, Captain's only, that addressed the importance of them meeting in person to discuss a major development which threatens the fabric of the Federation), has quite a potency, certain to cause a viewing audience to gasp.",7

Once there, he reveals his belief that there is something strange going on with Star Fleet's top brass. There have been a few accidental death, a reshuffling of assignments, once an entire starbase was evacuated for no reason. He thinks they're acting strangely and making zero sense. Picard is skeptical but remembers what Quinn told him previously. He leaves thinking things over but is convinced when Keel's ship is found mysteriously destroyed. He tasks Data with tracking Star Fleet's recent orders. Data confirms the irregularities so the Enterprise drops everything and heads to Earth to confront them.Everyone there is under the control of some parasite that's imbedded in the necks of the higher up. All the old men have incredible strength. They're able to subdue Quinn and Riker goes undercover as a parasite carrier. They are able to ambush the Admirals and kill Remmick who has distinguished himself as the leader. Without the parasitic queen, the rest of the parasites die and everyone is back to normal.This is the highlight of Season 1. It's a great call back to an earlier episode and really delivers a punch. The parasitic coup plot is great and we get a few fun action scenes (with hilariously obvious stunt doubles). The effects are super cool and some old school sci-fi, down to the shot of Remmick's head exploding. I also think it's a great episode for Riker stepping up to the challenge as Star Fleet captain and unafraid to risk his career for a belief he has.",9

Apparently, he could not stand the idea that an actual conspiracy to commit a coup de tat could happen in the United Federation of Planets, that Starfleet was way too cool to actually have such things happen. So, this episode, entitled ""Conspiracy,"" begins with talk of a conspiracy, continues as if there really is a conspiracy, and then about 2/3 of the way through becomes a disgusting C-movie horror story.Some like to praise this episode for experimenting with a ""dark sci-fi story."" If that's what this was, then it's a failed experiment. But, more than that, the fact is that ""Star Trek"" is never supposed to be ""dark."" ""Star Trek"" is a space-based action/adventure universe. It's supposed to be thrilling, fun, exciting, and stimulating to the imagination. When the series occasionally does put out a more serious episode, such as the classic ""Best of Both Worlds,"" then it does so in the context of being a space adventure. It never brings itself down to the level of horror. It's too good for that. Any fool can make a cheap horror story. ""Star Trek"" is supposed to be above that.The penultimate scene of this episode shows this horrifying creature emerge from the exploded body of a dead man and then get melted by Riker and Picard's phaser fire. It is a scene so graphic that it had to be cut when it aired on TV in Europe. And it is shameful.This episode deserves to be disowned. It is without a doubt the single worst story told in the entire ""Star Trek"" universe.",1

It involves the return of the Romulans who were last seen in Star Trek VI (chronologically) at the peace conference on Khitomer. However, as the Enterprise crew recounts past history, the last contact with the Romulans was 53 years ago at the Tomed Incident where there was heavy casualties. Since then, more urgent matters called them away - and this is hinted at with the destruction of star bases along the Neutral Zone on both Romulan and Federation sides (this episode hints at the Borg which will become a potent force starting in the second season). Other trivia: Worf mentions how the Romulans are without honor (which mirrors what he says in Star Trek: Nemesis - that they fought WITH honor). Also, TV died out as a form of entertainment in 2040, the Enterprise discovers 3 humans cryogenically frozen from Earth in a space capsule. But whereas the Enterprise encounters the past, it is the future that awaits them. As the Romulans say in this episode, ""we are back . . .""",

The way he describes it to the 3 people from the 20th century, it's a very eudaimonic era for mankind. Disease and wont for basic necessities is no longer a societal problem and money is not used.So the average Terran doesn't need to go to a job they hate for 40+ hours a week and sweat the bills every month. They are free to follow their joy. What is their Earth like? We only get to see the lives and trials of Starship officers. What do people do with their lives besides zip around the galaxy? What would the 24th century be like for a late 20th century housewife to be thrust into? Or for that matter, a boozehound C&W star and a Trump-like business man?

Originally, this final episode of season one was supposed to introduce the Borg. Now, they are just alluded to as some force that is wiping out Federation AND Romulan bases along the Neutral Zone. And, because much of the original episode was excised, they substituted a 'funny plot' involving three late 20th century people who were in suspended animation and were awakened by the Enterprise. So is the new melange any good? Well, yes. Having Q introduce the Borg later worked well. As for the funny subplot about suspended animation, it's only partially successful. This is because towards the very end, the audience is assaulted with a HUGE dose of Roddenberry and his Star Trek philosophy. The Captain goes off on a harangue about how in the the 25th century, there is no want, no greed, no worries about property and everyone is 100% equal. As a lifelong pessimist, this sort of preaching actually made me laugh a bit--and DID come off as very heavy-handed. It didn't ruin the episode but it sure did take you out of the moment.",6

They beam these 3 aboard and Dr. Crusher dethaws them and brings them back to life. Picard doesn't have time for this though as the Enterprise is en route to the Neutral Zone. The outposts in an area of the NZ have not reported in recently and Star Fleet assumes the worst. The bridge crew suspects Romulans.It's interesting how writers create scripts sometimes. Here we have a very interesting premise: a chain of destroyed outpost with an unknown and possibly invisible culprit on the prowl. That's a solid idea for an episode. But for whatever reason, these writers decide to make that the B plot and instead focus on a bunch of bumbling dingalings from the 20th century who have been dropped onto the Enterprise. I find their subplot far far less interesting.The financial guy is absolutely unbearable. The woman is a bad actress. The country singer is a straight up cartoon and possibly the only one interesting enough to get screentime. I do like Data's fascination with this guy. I bet him and Bones would have gotten along great.There are worse episodes they could finish off the season with but this feels a but underwhelming after the action packed penultimate episode that was Conspiracy. While that episode didn't feel 100% like your typical TNG episode it would have really worked as a season finale to lead us into next season. The cliffhanger we get here, this uneasy alliance between the Federation and the Romulans is sort of shoehorned in and takes a back seat to this Encino Man plot.

7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Neutral Zone (TV Episode 1988)",someone who hated life..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 01A promising start for the series, where cases may come and go, but the chemistry among the cast is what amps up the charge, with background still kept under the shades and just skimming off the surface of their equations, the makers have managed to tease us and hook us from the first adventure itself.The Neutral ZoneA pretty basic addition on the pile of their cases, where the threat may be higher than ever, but the plot isn't well polished to make you feel completely dazzled by their schemes, only to top it off with a mature climatic act to both the episode and the season.",

Instead it is a cryogenic lab vehicle with people frozen from the 21st century. The main plot of this episode involved getting the humans found on the space vehicle accustomed to the present day and the encounter with the Romulans.

These people become real nuisances, getting in the way, and not understanding the gravity of things. Meanwhile, a serious confrontation with the Romulans is about to take place.

11,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Neutral Zone (TV Episode 1988)",Worst Episode of the Entire Series,"To me, this episode has always been the absolute nadir of the series. It's just dreadful. It makes ""Sub Rosa"" seem like ""The City On The Edge Of Forever"".Like many episodes, this one is structured such that there is a main story, and a secondary story. The main story is about the Enterprise's big-deal mission to the Romulan neutral zone to find out what happened to its lost outposts. The secondary story is about a few cryogenically frozen humans who they discover and revive. *Both* of these stories have deep flaws.There are actually a couple problems with the secondary story. The first is that it swamps and dwarfs the main story. A crisis with the Romulans *ought* to be a big deal, and yet the story focuses mainly on these three 20th century people. And frankly, who cares? While it's sort of interesting seeing how they deal with waking up centuries later, the fact is that we the viewers already have the meta-knowledge that these people aren't important and we're never going to see or hear about them again. There's really no story about them, no plot, just watching them react in their different ways to their new lives. It all really goes nowhere.The other problem with the secondary story is the overt smug preachiness of it. One of the 20th century humans is this straw-man caricature of a businessman, a typical leftist stereotype that serves as a tool for typical leftist bashing of business and capitalism. Sadly, the series specialized in this sort of thing in this era. The original Ferengi were exactly the same thing.And yet, for all the problems with the secondary story, the main story is *worse*. Why? Because there *is* no main story! ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENS. They journey to the neutral zone, find nothing, the Romulans show up and say ""We're back!"", and that's it. Done. Absolutely *nothing* happens. There is no story. There is no plot. The whole thing is a ludicrous waste of time.What damns this episode to eternal Star Trek hell is the fact that it was clearly written to be some kind of big cliff-hanger, except the next season's opener did not pick up and finish the episode. There was no resolution, nothing went anywhere with any of this. Had the next season picked up where this one left off, and had the Romulans actually *do* something, had the big-deal dramatic ""We're back!"" actually *led* to something, then the episode might not be quite so vile. But it didn't. And so I always remember this as the episode where absolutely nothing happened. And I detest it for that.",1
12,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" The Neutral Zone (TV Episode 1988)",Season One,"For ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", it was always going to be difficult to follow in the footsteps of the ""Original Series"" iconic cast. Though all the pieces of a terrific ensemble cast are present in this first season, the show is too concerned about defining its tone than it is about developing stories or telling engaging stories.Set a significant time in the future from The Original Series, Next Generation constructs a much more diplomatic-themed universe. Whereas Captain Kirk was the swashbuckling, Horatio Hornblower type, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) is ""the great diplomat"", leaving his Number One William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) to handle the strutting about. While in the long run this approach will pay great dividends, opening up the Trek universe to a new set of stories, it doesn't hit on that right formula all too often in Season One. For example...-Far, far too much focus on Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton), a child character who the writers really, really wanted to give a push but it just never works.
-Security Chief Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) never works for the show. This is made even more blatant when Klingon Worf (Michael Dorn) pretty much just stands around despite being a bevy of story opportunities (that would transpire later).
-Geordi La Forge (Levar Burton) hasn't yet found his way to engineering, where he would shine in later seasons.
-The women on the show, especially Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden), don't have much of a role besides being eye candy or love interests, which stick out like a sore thumb on a show supposedly based on enlightened principles.
-Data (Brent Spiner) will become perhaps the show's most interesting character in subsequent seasons, but he isn't there yet. The show creators don't quite know how to understand the Android character yet.Now, all of that isn't to say that this First Season is a complete failure. The new Enterprise is a great ship visually, guest star Q (John De Lancie) is a hoot, and there are a handful of solid stories. It's just that the show is way too focused on ""environment"" at the expense of what really should drive TV shows...interesting stories and developing characters.So, despite the fact that all the players are in place, Season One of Next Generation doesn't know how (or seem to care) to use them correctly. A lot of episodes can easily be skipped (downright boring), a good number are ""average at best"", and only a handful are really entertaining. New viewers will be tempted to jump off the bandwagon early on Next Generation, but I would implore them to stick with it at least until Season Two, where things begin to show a marked improvement.",4

They have captured Picard, Troi, and Geordi, while Dr. Crusher remains in command of the Enterprise (facing her own challenges). And, Riker and Worf (still on the planet with 45 others) soon encounter another group of self-aware Borg lead by Hugh (again played by ""I, Borg"" Jonathan Del Arco).Find out what happens in this exciting ""Descent"" conclusion episode. Only real complaint is that Hugh doesn't meet Geordi (his ""friend"" from ""I, Borg"") in this episode, which I found disappointing.Trivia note: Dr. Crusher uses the metaphasic shielding she learned about in the 6th season episode ""Suspicions"" to outrun the Borg. The emotion chip seen in this episode will reach its conclusion a year later in Star Trek: Generations. We see Spot again too.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent: Part II (TV Episode 1993)",The Lost Boys,"By the time I began watching TNG, the seventh season was already in progress. Still to this day, I am a TOS Star Trek guy and I didn't want to even experience the second show. As a teenager, my parents started watching it and I caught most of the show. This was one that I missed for some reason.After the show went off the air, a writer from Entertainment Weekly wrote about each episode of the show, ranking them in order. This was one of the lower ranked episodes and possibly the lowest ranked two part episode. This was due mainly to the treatment of the Borg. The once ultra cool cyborgs which to this day are still the most formidable foe of the Federation (I used the alliteration on purpose)were used so poorly. He referred to them as ""the lost boys"" of the galaxy, and the Peter Pan reference was accurate. The show never really makes clear what happened. Hugh explains that the Borg were of one mind and his individuality messed that up. This makes no sense whatsoever. If the Borg are incapable of taking away individuality and placing that mind into the collective, then the Borg cannot exist. Simply what they have been doing forever cannot be done with one Borg drone? And the argument that it couldn't be done with Hugh because he is already a Borg is not valid either. They took the simplest thing the Borg are capable of doing and made them incapable of doing it. It was asinine. Beyond that, the episode seems to imply that this was an effect that affected the entire collective. It also implies that it was only these Borg. This sets off a chain of events that makes the Borg harder to understand. We start learning that the Borg ships individually are collectives not linked to the whole. Then we are told all ships are linked to the whole. It gets confusing, and it started with this sub average episode.But even putting the Borg to the side. This episode is disturbing for the experiments that Data puts his friends through. Lore has all the compassion of the Jigsaw killer an making Data do it was sickening. I doubt I'll ever watch this again.",5

In the first part, the Borg attack the Enterprise. But it's not THE Borg but an odd offshoot. Oddly, at the end of this episode, they learn that Lore, Data's evil twin, is behind it all--and he takes several of the crew prisoner.This second part has two main plots. With lots of the crew on the planet looking for Lore and the Borg, Dr. Crusher is in command and must contend with the Borg and rescuing the crew--no small feat. The main plot involves Data, who is under some sort of mind control by Lore. Can Geordi and the other prisoners manage to break through Data's new programming to get him to refuse to do Lore's evil bidding?All in all, this is a very exciting finale--and I almost always love these two-parters because there's so much action and mayhem! Well worth seeing--especially since Lore is so wonderfully bad!",9
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent: Part II (TV Episode 1993)","Metaphasic Shielding, Captain Crusher and Ensign Taitt","This episode is a great piece of evidence that in Trek, there are hardly any ""throw away"" gadgets or gimmicks. Already we are revisiting ""I, Borg"" and ""Brothers"" and in this finale, also season 6's ""Suspicions"".Picard, Geordi and Troi are captured by Lore and Data - Data is NOT himself. His Ethical Subprogram, the one thing that makes him different than Lore, has been shut off. Crosus (Brian Cousins) shut it off in the last episode. In fact Crosus is Lore's number one Crony. Meanwhile, away teams are out on the surface, and Worf and Riker while trying to track Picard's whereabouts, find Hugh's secret lair- So we see that Hugh may have been the catalyst for this new state of Borg Individuality, but he did not exploit it - That in fact was Lore.But ""Captain Crusher"" is on command of the Bridge - And is attacked by the huge Borg Monstrosity-Ship while the away teams are planet-side.With about a minute to beam everyone up, they get all but about ""47"" crew-members who are on the planet before she is chased off by the huge Borg Non-Cube ship - She traverses the Trans-Warp Conduit and sends out a beacon, then goes back to try to get those 47 crewmen.And this is where we meet Ensign Taitt (the gorgeous Alex Datcher) - Low Ensign on the Totem Pole, Crusher keeps her handy on the Bridge and this is good for her, and us as well. James Horan, who was the evil Jo'Bril in ""Suspicions"" shows up as ""Lieutenant Barnaby"" - And this is a mix for some great Bridge Interaction.Down below, Data begins to torture Geordi, who had seen with his VISOR that Lore is in fact controlling him. Lore orders Data to take the VISOR away. Riker and Worf confront Hugh - Hugh gives us the history behind this change in the Borg, but he will not help Riker and he still blames The Enterprise and crew for what had happened to them. But he does show Riker how to get into the main complex.Meanwhile Crusher goes back to the planet, on the opposite side of where the Borg ""Winchester Mystery House in Space"" is, and is able to beam up all but Riker and Worf and Picard's party - So, with nowhere to run heads for the SUN. Because she has a plan.She uses the Metaphasic Shielding tech left over from ""Suspicions"" to enter the stars Corona, and stays there, while the Borg ship waits.Picard with Geordi's help is able to reboot Data's Ethical Subroutine, it's a guess when and if it worked. In fact it works right away, while Riker, Worf and Hugh (who had changed his mind) get into the main Borg- Palais.Ensign Taitt has a way to get the Sun to Flare Up - As Worf's brother Kurn had done with his warp drive in Redemption Part II - And is seen again in Deep Space Nine, Season 7, Episode 2, Worf uses the same technique to blow up some Jem'Hadar Shipyards. This is also where Ensign Taitt and Lt Barnaby have some great discussions.Despite this treatment of The Borg, many of the other aspects of this episode were central for some of the best episodes of Next Generation and Deep Space Nine. And the Data/Lore storyline is finally given an ending. We are left with the impression, despite all he had done, Lore really did finally have love for Data. Data still cannot share this, but Lore had the emotion chip - And Data will not have it until ""Generations"". And my favourite part of this episode is as Lore is deactivated, his eyes cloud over and we can see the life going away.So we see here that Lore, not having Data on hand to share the emotion chip with, was using it to influence The Borg, who were at least halfway ""artificial"" - It also explains why Lore had sent Crosus to get Data. Lore was trying to make The Borg as totally electronic as he was, we saw the destroyed Borg Drones he had experimented on.And I think, this is a hard story to swallow, not because of the native change in the Borg, not that the Borg had been destroyed - We know from this episode that the rest of the Borg Collective had not been affected by Hugh. Some of this was explored in Voyager. But the juggling of Data/Lore/Borg and Metaphasic Shielding, perhaps was too much stuff for the average fan to digest. But as I revisit these two episodes, the more I enjoy them, the more connections I find in them. And I always loved the Lore episodes, where Brent Spiner plays against himself.My Only Regret is that ""Hugh"" - Jonathan Del'Arco - Did not have a reunion with Geordi, there was simply no time for it, maybe something was filmed, but it was impossible to fit it in to this story. So I have to believe Geordi would not have left before talking to Hugh, and I imagine that the two had a discussion before parting- It's just Offscreen.",10
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent: Part II (TV Episode 1993)",The worst plot devices all crammed into a single two part episode,"The writers resort to 2 dimensional comic book characterizations, 19th century plot devices and lapses in logic in this 2 part episode.Lore is a smirking ""Eevyil Genius"" with a master plan for elimination of inferior beings and Universal Domination. He has set up silly structure with vaguely fascists looking symbolic elements where a few Borg have become his minions (meaning, of course, they are cannon fodder who can only hit non recurring characters in hand to hand combat, are hard to kill when it isn't important, but extremely vulnerable when being killed moves the plot along.We know all of this, because, instead of doing what bad critters really do, and just doing their evil deeds, Lore must tell his victims exactly what his plans are, and, also, provide sufficient scenarios in which his victims can concoct escape plans. This results in several 1960s style expositional scenes in which Lore almost produces a ""Mha-mha- mha, victory is mine"".The Borg guards fall for a ""Captain isn't feeling well"" get out of force field ruse because, of course, they have deep wells of empathy for humans. The day is saved by a ""get in touch with your better self"" speech in which Data is reminded who his true friends are (with a touch of technobabble and deus ex machina technology to help things along.)In the end, we have a suitably melancholy ending, with just the right amount of hope, as Data chooses to give up emotion so that he doesn't become a monster, but his one true friend, Geordi, intimates that, maybe, in the future he will be ready.Hugh the Borg is told to look into himself and find leadership qualities, because all things touched by the Enterprise become ""the most important thing of their kind in the Universe.""All in all, writing out of our naive past, without the cheesy charm of brilliant hammy actors.",3
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent: Part II (TV Episode 1993)",The Descent of our opinion of Data,"Brent Spiner stated that playing Lore was much easier for him than playing Data because he is much more similar to Lore. When you watch this show and previous episodes in which Lore was featured, that statement should scare the hell out of you. Yet if you've interacted with the man at a sci fi convention or read about other people's interactions with him then you know that the statement is accurate. He is a good actor and a creepy human being.This episode is a bit of a mess. As other people have remarked here, everything seemed to be wrapped up a bit too tidily. Data, who seemed quite psychopathic in most of the first episode and until the final few minutes of this episode, suddenly realizes that maybe doing Nazi-like experiments on his friends is bad because.... ummm, the episode's runtime is almost over, I guess.Data's personality in this two-part set is extremely disturbing. It taints whatever goodwill we had for his character. When he receives mild doses of feelings from Lore his reaction is to kill or torture to continue to receive more doses. If you believe that Lore is stripping his autonomy from him by this method, you are let down when you see him beg for more of it when he begins to return to a robotic mindset. I also remember that when his emotion chip was active in the movies he seemed like a cowering imbecile. In other words, when Data is left to his own devices, he seems unlikeable and maybe even abhorrent.I enjoyed the return of Hugh, yet as other people have noted here, his story about how his newfound autonomy almost destroyed the Borg was confusing.This show's good acting is almost ruined by writers who didn't seem to know what they were doing-- writers who caused us to question our fandom for Data.",4
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent: Part II (TV Episode 1993)",Data turns 'evil' and Beverley flies into a sun,"At the end of the previous episode we saw Picard, Geordi and Troi surrounded by rogue Borg as Data's brother Lore tells them that he and Data will destroy the Federation. They are taken into custody and Data takes their communicators and Geordi's visor. They then start speculating how Lore may have persuaded Data to turn on his colleagues. It is determined that he gave Data negative emotions and somehow disabled his ethical subroutines to 'cure' him they will have to find a way to restart these subroutines. Meanwhile the Borg ship returns and Riker orders Dr. Crusher to beam up as many of the away teams as possible then return to Federation space via the sub-space conduit. She returns to the conduit but doesn't enter; instead she sends a message buoy before returning to beam up more people. The Borg ship attacks and she orders the navigator to take the Enterprise into the sun using the shield modifications that were first introduced in the episode 'Suspicions'. Riker and Worf meet a familiar Borg, who has not been seduced by Lore's ideas, and attempt to rescue Picard and the others.This episode provides an exciting conclusion to a two part story and a great start to season Seven. The big question at the end of the last episode was 'how could the ever-reliable Data turn on his friends?' and here we learn just how Lore engineered it for him to be given certain negative emotions before over-riding his ethical subroutines. Having Data acting out of character and his 'evil' brother Lore appear in the episode gives Brent Spiner chance to be a little less restrained which is a lot of fun to watch. This episode also sees Gates McFadden take her character into a more interesting direction as Dr Crusher is left in charge of the ship and has to make decisions that could have life or death implications for all on board rather than just one patient. The story is exciting with plenty of tense moments; most notable as Data performs potentially fatal experiments on Geordi. It was nice to see how this story referred back to events in previous episodes. Overall a great start to the seventh of final season of TNG.",9
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent: Part II (TV Episode 1993)",Overcoming Your Programming,"There are two issues at work here. The future of the Borg (disconnected) and the futures of Data and Lore. Data has been neutralized and a chip producing negative emotions installed. He has hooked up with Dr. Soon's miscreant throwaway child, Lore, who has become a threat to the Universe by engaging independent Borg (the product of Hugh's leaving the hive). This is mostly about Data and his ability to function (not unlike the Borg with his analytical side butting up against the good side). The problem for Lore is that he is unprincipled and evil and has no redeeming qualities. He destroys everything in his path for power, and because he is so transparent, he alienates those he must enlist in his schemes. Data begins to see the illogic of these actions, and while he longs to experience emotions again and to advance his humanity, there are things within him that block the pathways. Simply stated, he is only partially sure of things and that becomes a dilemma for him. This is a neat episode, even if one is concerned only with the fate of the crew members and Captain PIcard.",9

These scenes had all of the story's energy and tension.7/10",7
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Descent: Part II (TV Episode 1993)",I'd rather watch a Sons of Soong spin-off series,"So let me get this straight. The Borg perpetuate themselves by assimilating individuals into their collective. But when they assimilate Hugh back into the collective his individuality causes a catastrophic systems failure? Their entire existence is based on the assimilation of individuality, but if a Borg regains individuality and then is assimilated a second time his individuality cannot be processed? Okay that checks out.The enterprise has a complement of over 1000 people. Let's be generous and assume the skeleton crew aboard the enterpriser consists of 200 people and that another 200 aren't officers (family of officers, children, ect.). That's 600 people on the planet. After 50 seconds of beaming there are 73 people left on the planet. After 15 more seconds there are only 47 people left. Working backwards that's 26 people every 15 seconds which means about 87 people were beamed off the surface during the preceding 50 seconds for a grand total of 113 people pulled off the surface. Plus the 47 left on the surface that's 160 people that were looking for Data and a skeleton crew of 840 left on board the enterprise. Okay good that checks out too.Lore and Data want to create a race of purely artificial life forms by cobbling together a visor with Borg technology. Oh wait, its because Geordi can see the carrier wave Lore is using to manipulate Data. Got it.Hey look, there's a chair on the bridge, not the first time I've seen one of those, where are they stored? The Borg ship is massive and unaffected by the Enterprises weapons. The Borg's weapons can knock out warp drive while the shields are up. No special generators are needed for metaphasic shielding, just a computer program. Got it; checks out.Other thoughts:Crusher, Tate, and Barneby's efforts to battle the Borg ship are by far the best part of this episode.Its nice to see Hugh again. I really like I Borg, but I didn't want or need a follow up. Now that there is a fledgling colony of independent Borg on a remote planet a follow up does seem appropriate, but it never comes.Finally, I wish I wish I wish Geordi didn't stop data from destroying the emotion chip as this episode is directly responsible for the Data we get in Generations and that Data is the absolute worst.I want a spin-off series featuring ensign Tate. I imagine she can get any posting she wants with ""destroyed a Borg ship"" on her service record.Verdict: Semi-enjoyable, mostly forgettable, bad for canon.Fun facts:47 People were left behind after the Borg ship attacks.The words bouye and buoyancy occur with alarming frequency. Well 3 times but still.The Sons of Soong is (or was) a band working and recording in Oakland county Michigan. They released an album called ""Stillborn and Afterbirth"".

And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily.

Spiner as the android, Lt.

Meanwhile, Picard and a pilot are en route to their planet to meet the ambassador there but are forced to crash land on a desolate planet. With the pilot killed and Picard knocked unconscious, he is rescued by a woman named Anna who has been on this planet by herself for 7 years.But Picard soon suspects that Anna isn't who she seems, and neither are the ambassadors onboard the Enterprise.Trivia note: Troi's love of desserts is shown here - especially chocolate (including a chocolate puff with 17 varieties of chocolate in it)! Also, Anna crashed landed 7 years ago (an homage I think to the fact this is the 7th season). And, we see another one of the crew's poker games.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Liaisons (TV Episode 1993)",Unusual ambassadors,"This episode sees the Enterprise hosting two Ilarian ambassadors as Picard travels to their home world with a third. Things get off to an awkward start when one of them, who was meant to be looked after by Riker, insists that he must be looked after by Worf. From then on he is consistently rude; it is almost as if he is deliberately goading Worf. The ambassador assigned to Troi couldn't be more different; he is friendly and keen to enjoy himself; especially when he discovers the delights of chocolate. Picard meanwhile has greater problems; the shuttle he is travelling in hits a spacial anomaly and crash lands on a remote planet. The Ilarian is seriously injured so Picard goes to seek help. He is caught in a plasma storm and rendered unconscious. When he wakes up he finds he has been moved to crashed cargo transporter by a woman who says she has been alone on the planet for seven years. She informs him that she went to the shuttle and found the Ilarian dead. He is determined to find a way to contact help but while she claims to be keen to escape the planet her actions suggest otherwise then she starts hitting on Picard; claiming to be in love with him!After a dramatic season opener this is more of an 'alien of the week' episode; that doesn't mean it isn't fun though. Of the two ambassadors on the Enterprise the one who is with Worf provides most of the entertainment; his belligerence and rudeness look sure to start a fight and when they finally do his reaction is priceless, we also have an hilarious moment when Data points out that all these negative traits mean he and Worf have a lot in common. The story on the planet is intriguing although I'm sure most viewers will get an inkling that the woman isn't what she claims to be long before Picard learns the truth. When we finally learn the reasons behind what we have seen it makes sense within the context of an alien race making contact with a new society. Overall this might not be a classic but it is still a decent episode with a good mix of drama and humour.",7

This is a serious weakness in an otherwise decent plot.When the Ilarian ambassadors enter the ship, one of the ambassadors requests that Worf escort him around instead of Riker. The other is escorted by Troi and he spends most of the show eating EVERYTHING that is edible. Later, Picard is stranded on a planet and is discovered by a screwy lady who is HIGHLY reminiscent of Kathy Batesin ""Misery"". What do these three things have in common? See the show.As I said, the idea in of the Ilarians is novel and interesting. I just wished it had been handled a tad differently--making it all a bit less obvious.",7

Except for Picard, he and one of the aliens go for a bromantic shuttle ride.Everyone at the party in 10 forward has a grand old time except for Worf who gets to play waiter for his alien companion. Data makes small talk with Worf and its pretty funny, in a Star Trek sort of way.Meanwhile on the shuttle, Picard and his alien brodie are having an awkward moment when the power suddenly fails and they have to crash land on a desolate planet. Communications are out and Pircard's brodie is hurt so Picard goes outside to look for help. Its noteworthy how many breathable atmospheres there are in the Star Trek universe. He's hit by a plasma discharge and rescued by a stranger.Back on the Enterprise Worf is playing nice with his new frienemy (Geordi is too modest, I'd have said yes because its so obviously true). Troi is out and about with her new alien bestie who's never seen a child before. They make a new friend and then go get desert. Its funny, in a Star Trek sort of way.On the planet Picard awakens to find himself injured and alone with a mysterious women named Ana.

Then she makes him dinner and starts forcing the issue while he works on a way off the planet. Its a little awkward.Worf is still bad at poker. Not only does he lack a poker face but he keeps his chips in front of another player. The ensuing conflict is completely predictable and somewhat funny, in a Star Trek sort of way.Hooray, Picard has MacGyvered a way off the planet but his savior would rather stay and bang him out.

The other is introduced to desserts by Troi, and his appetites become insatiable. Picard takes a shuttle with the third Iyaaran, but the dialogue between them is rough at best. When the shuttlecraft hits an ""energy discharge"" during their journey, crashlanding on a planet with constant ""plasma interference"", Picard and the Iyaaran are hurt.

He is pulled away by a woman named Anna, for whom he awakens to. She proves to be an obsessive captor needing Picard to love her! She even accosts him with kisses and appeals for his love in one strange scene as Picard has to force her off of his person! Told he has broken ribs and that the Iyaaran is dead, Picard recuperates and soon learns that Anna is not who she says. She tells him she has spent seven years on the uninhabited planet and that thoughts of leaping from a precipice to her doom have crept in her heart at moments. When her love isn't shared and Picard ""calls her bluff"" on jumping (a necklace is a clue), he soon discovers something the Iyaarans have been needing to understand is the reason he's on the godforsaken planet. Human emotion (well, not just human, just concepts like love, antagonism, and the joy of ""bad food"") intrigues the Iyaarans so they want to get as much understanding of it as possible. Okay episode is more amusing than anything else, a tiny blip within the long-running series, ""Liaisons"" won't be confused with Yesterday's Enterprise or Relics, but it has its entertainment value. If anything seeing Worf uncomfortably stuck in a diplomatic role has its comic value, and seeing the Iyaaran rise up after being physically assaulted by Worf thanking the Klingon for enlightening him on the use of violence on the receiving end of antagonism is a hoot! Troi getting tired of chocolate after her Iyaaran has been feeding himself silly over the course of his stay is also quite funny. ""Liaisons"" is more of a diversion than something you'll remember long after its over.

The third goes on a mission with Picard on a shuttlecraft. He barely speaks to Picard, seeming to be quite annoyed at being with him. A malfunction in the shuttlecraft sends them to a planet that has intense storms. They are trapped and Picard, leaving his ""friend"" behind (he was badly injured in the crash) tries a bit of reconnaissance but is hit by a bolt from the sky. He is rescued by an attractive young woman who takes him with her to her hiding place. She nurses him, but keeps him locked up. I think that if there is a bit of a weakness in the verisimilitude in this series, it has to do with shape changing and out and out magical abilities of the aliens.

That doesn't mean I dislike him but he isn't very interesting. They play on his inability to form relationships, but he never gets out of his head. He is dull. This episode, which involves the death of his mother, has him going off half cocked and not recognizing clues that his experiences should have taught him. When his mother shows up, he should have had some suspicions about who she was. He ignore the advice of the crew. Granted he has lost his mother, but her appearance is in the oddest circumstance.

Wanting to retrieve any data the ship's crew discovered Geordi uses the interface again; this time something strange happens he meets his mother! She explains that her ship is lower in the atmosphere and that what he is seeing is a projection; if she and her crew are to be saved Geordi will have to take the damaged ship lower. The rest of the Enterprise crew are convinced that he is seeing what he wants to see but he is certain that it is his mother and is determined to help even when ordered to stop using the device.This episode was a little disappointing; almost as soon as we see an experimental new device it is being used in an emergency situation. The way the device is depicted is rather strange too; as Geordi steers the probe we see him rather than the probe this might make it easier for us to observe his emotional response to things but it makes no logical sense. When we finally learn how he is seeing his 'mother' even though she was last seen hundreds of light-years away it isn't exactly a surprise; the series has featured so many previously undiscovered lifeforms that another comes as a bit of a cliché. While I like the character of Georgi I think he isn't a good choice to carry an episode as he is the closest the show has to an ordinary bloke; likable but not exactly extrovert every episode where he takes the lead seems to feature a way of forcing him to act somewhat out of character. Overall this was entertaining enough but not as good as one would expect from this series.",6

In short Order, Data is elevated to acting Captain and Worf to First Officer.Riker has been abducted by the raiders he has been chasing, and he gets a big surprise on the bridge of their vessel.These are not common thieves, they have an agenda. Richard Lynch (Baran) rules over them with Iron Fist, augmented with a device that gives him sole authority, whether anyone else likes it or not. And on this ship, nobody does, including a mysterious old fart named ""Galen"".Galen pulls Riker aside and tells Riker about the Raider's yet-unknown agenda, and they conspire to send the Enterprise the probable targets of the Raider's ship. Galen is not liked well by Baran, and sets up Riker in Baran's eyes as a less than exemplary Starfleet Officer, Citing his Insubordination from ""Chain of Command"" - This allows Riker to get chummy with Baran so he can get more info out of him.And then there is Tallera, a ""Romulan"" - She is Baran's right hand woman, but she is friendly toward Galen.

Picard's whereabouts in a seedy bar; nobody wants to talk but eventually a witness claims to have seen him vaporised and DNA evidence seems to prove this. Riker assumes command of the ship and is determined to bring those responsible to justice. The evidence points to a group of mercenaries who have been stealing artefacts from Romulan archaeological sites. A quick check of the local systems identifies their likely next target and a team beams down; they get into a firefight with the mercenaries and Riker is captured. On board the mercenary ship he has quite a surprise when he sees that Picard is far from dead; he is one of the crew! Picard engineers a situation to show that Riker could be useful then tells him how he came to be in his current position. It turns out he had been investigating the mercenaries when they captured him; he claimed to be an archaeologist named Galen and was set to work trying to identify a specific Romulan artefact. Meanwhile Data has taken command of the Enterprise and is searching for the Mercenary ship.This episode gets off to a great start; while I doubt many viewers will think Picard is really dead it still comes as a surprise and leaves people guessing just what really happened. When we do learn that he is still alive the mystery doesn't end; in fact it only deepens. Surely he can't really have gone bad, and once it is established that he hasn't there is still the question of what the mercenaries are actually looking for and for what purpose. There are plenty of tense moments including the shootout with the mercenaries; a scene where Picard encourages the mercenary leader to kill Riker and finally a cliffhanging standoff between the Enterprise and the mercenary vessel. Overall a good introduction to this story that left me intrigued to find out what will happen next.",8

I assume it's because he's anxious to discover their wicked plans regarding some artifact, though perhaps this was just Picard's mid- life crisis. Regardless, later Riker is captured by the pirates and to avoid being killed, he pretends to be a horrible Starfleet officer--one who is quick to betray the Enterprise to save his own butt. Where is it all going? This episode is slightly better than the follow-up--mostly because the next episode ends poorly.

Plotting-wise, it's almost (but not quite) worthy of Roy Huggins. (Huggins was never one to Make Important Points.) You can discover these for yourself. This review will focus on the acting.The various Star Trek series have never been strong on casting. Any of them is lucky to have one really fine actor in the regular cast.

They raise their voices as if they're trying to be heard at the back of a stadium with a non-functioning PA system. They wildly over-emote in an manner more like a high school production of a Shakespeare tragedy.It's some of the worst ""acting"" I've ever seen in an American TV series. (The absolute worst is Martin Landau's death scene in the ""Bonanza"" episode ""The Gift"".) Peter Lauritson, the director, must have been in a rush, or didn't care that Frakes and Sirtis broke one of the most-basic of acting rules -- restrain yourself.

2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Gambit, Part II (TV Episode 1993)",A Vulcan plot,"This episode, the second of a two part story, opens where the previous part left off; the mercenary ship has fired on the Enterprise but have caused little damage as Picard had arranged for the weapons to 'malfunction' and fire at a lower setting. Sensing that Riker must have a plan Data lets the mercenary ship escape. Having scanned numerous artefacts Picard finally finds the one that the mercenaries have been looking for; something is odd though; all the other items were Romulan but this item appears to be an ancient Vulcan artefact. Soon afterwards the 'Romulan' mercenary identifies herself as an undercover Vulcan agent; she says that the artefact is part of an ancient Vulcan weapon that uses psychic power. Insurgents who believe Vulcan should become isolationist as contact with alien races is 'contaminating their culture'. There is one more part to collect from a Klingon courier before it is taken to Vulcan; then the mercenary leader plans to have Riker eliminate Picard.This was, for the most part, a really good episode. The previous part nicely suggested that the Romulans would ultimately appear as the villains so it was a real surprise to learn that Vulcans are behind the crimes. It was a lot of fun watching Riker and Picard pretending to despise each other as they work to foil the mercenaries' schemes. It was also entertaining to see the Enterprise performing a 'health and safety' inspection on the Klingon shuttle that was transporting another part of the weapon. The episodes weakness was when the Vulcan weapon was actually used and we learn that to work it relies on the victim's own violent urges this gives us a hippyish 'love conquers violence' solution to the problem which was a little disappointing after all the good work before. After that we do get a rather funny prologue where Picard, who is officially dead, tells Data to throw Riker, who is officially a rogue officer, into the brig!

But Tallera finds him out, and in finding out, reveals to Galen her ""true"" identity. But is it just another half- truth? Maybe. The reason why Tallera is so interested in Logic is because her actual race is.I thought I had figured it all out by mid-episode, but there are still reverses to be doled out here.Data finds a Klingon Courier who was to deliver a final piece to this puzzle to Baran (Richard Lynch)- So they fabricate a reason to ""inspect"" his shuttle for fruit flies and Hold him - The Courier Koral (James Worthy) appears to be at least 2 feet taller than Worf, whether he actually is this tall or if it was an effect is no matter, it's effective.

Who is deceiving who and for what reason?And the artifact is actually a dangerous weapon that had been discarded by the Vulcans long ago, over 2000 years ago.5,000 years before this episode was to take place the Vulcans were a barbaric people until they found Logic - This is established in the Original Trek episode ""All Our Yesterdays""- And in this Next Generation episode, we have a person who is willing to take back that 5,000 years of hard fought social development.It is an entertaining and exiting story with a hard truth attached to it, as there are people in the world today in our neighborhoods, and elected into our governments who will try to roll back Civil Rights to the state they were in previous to the Civil War.Xenophobic Isolationism is how it is referred to here, in our reality it is called ""Extremism"" and just as unpleasant.This second offering in this 2-parter finalizes this interesting and thought provoking episode, full of feints-within-feints and the final resolution is most satisfying - And Logical.ǂ""Rihannsu"" is a non-canon name for the Romulan Race in their native language, used in the ""Rihannsu"" Trek Novels.",10

Soon, after another nightmare, he ""oversleeps"" since his internal chronometer fails. Data soon experiences strange hallucinations and begins attacking Troi!But what is causing his nightmares? Watch this intriguing episode that delves further into Data's dreams (as began in ""Birthright, Part I"").Trivia note: Clyde Kusatsu reprises his role as Admiral Nakamura (the last time we saw him was in the second season episode ""The Measure Of A Man"", another Data-oriented episode). Worf mentions his son Alexander. And we also see Data's cat Spot again (which Worf turns out to be allergic to), right as Data goes to bed!",

Now, for the first time, he's exploring his ability to dream. However, things go pretty weird as his dreams have a repetitive and rather violent nature. So, Data tries to enlist the help of Freud* to tease apart the hidden meaning of these dreams. Later, however Data stabs Counselor Troi (yay!) and the crew quickly realize that Data isn't evil or nuts-- there are some weird giant invisible creatures eating away at them and Data was trying to destroy them. Can they stop these brain slugs before it's too late?This is a fairly good episode. But some of the dreams are so disgustingly weird (such as Dr. Crusher slurping away at Riker's brain with a straw) that I found myself enjoying the show much more! Worth seeing.*It's a bit anachronistic about having the Freudian angle in the show as today most therapists have rejected major portions of analytic therapy. This sort of long, long-term therapy has been supplanted by more short-term and problem-focused therapies (such as Behavioral and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapies). So why in the 24th century is Data consulting with Dr. Freud in the dreams?",8
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Phantasms (TV Episode 1993)",Salvador Data,"This is one of the most surreal of all the episodes. Data has logged into his dream self and finds himself wandering the Enterprise. He encounters a group of workmen in dungarees tearing a hole in a wall. When he confronts them, he loses his voice and they attack him, ripping his head off and tearing off an arm and a leg. He awakens and faces his crew members. As things develop he has another dream. In this one, he sees Deanna turned into a cake. As she begs him not to cut into the cake he does anyway. The other plot occurring is the enterprise having problems with its warp drive and impulse engines. Time reveals that some sort of foreign entity has attached itself to several crew members and the fact is that if something is not done, they will die from loss of vital body substances, left as a pool of elements. I have never understood the holodeck. Data has a session with Sigmund Freud. Since this is a computer creation of Freud, of what assistance would it be. I suppose the vast computer banks were used to create the essence of Freud. Anyway, this proves to be a bizarre episode but well worth the time.",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Phantasms (TV Episode 1993)",Data's strange dreams,Things are rather strange as this episode opens; Data walks through the corridors of the Enterprise and comes across a trio of old-time miners who are using pick-axes on the ship's systems; they attack Data and pull him apart. He then wakes up; it was just a dream. He had been running a dream program for some time but this is his first nightmare. Counsellor Troi suggests that he shouldn't worry and exploring such dreams could be good for him. His next dream is even stranger; he has an old phone in his chest and cuts into a cake that is Counsellor Troi! It isn't long before the nightmares start leaking into his real life and he stabs a terrified Troi when he sees what appears to be a mouth on her shoulder. Meanwhile problems with the ship's new warp engine looks likely to mean Picard will miss a banquet something he isn't too upset about.This is what Star Trek would be if David Cronenberg guest directed of course this doesn't take things so far but the body horror is certainly weird enough I never thought I'd see Beverly drinking Riker's brain through a large straw! Inevitably Data's dreams prove to be linked to the engine problems and the strange creatures; these creatures are also pretty creepy. With all the slightly disturbing imagery it is just as well that there are some good comic moments; most notably when Data asks Worf to look after Spot and Picard's lack of disappointment when it looks as though he can't get to the banquet. Overall a distinctly weird but enjoyable instalment.,8

However, one of the delegate's little girl, Hedril (played by a very young Kirsten Dunst) makes Lwaxana very sad. Soon, she falls unconscious, having retreated into her mind. Troi tries to go into her mother's mind to find out what's happening - it has to do with her past and it all has everything to do with Hedril.Definitely the saddest of the Lwaxana episodes, where she is usually very comedic, but it's nice to see this side of Lwaxana.Trivia note: Worf mentions he does not like telepaths. We see the arboretum again too. We see Troi's father too. Data also refers to his dream analysis (from ""Birthright"" and ""Phantasms""). Mr. Homn is also mentioned (though doesn't appear in this episode).",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Dark Page (TV Episode 1993)",Another Sad Episode,"Season 7 was certainly the most introspective season of this series, with several visits to the subconscious of the major characters. Dark Page explores the consequences of psychic trauma - in this case, for Lwaxana Troi. In Majel Barrett's final appearance on Next Generation, she gave what was probably the finest performance of her career. It's a shame this new depth of character never had a chance to be built on in later episodes. Lwaxana's crisis was clearly a turning point in her relationship with Deanna, and might have led to some interesting future episodes. It's interesting that I watch the episode and wonder why Majel Barrett wasn't nominated for an Emmy Award, and another review thought she was terrible. To each his own, I guess...",8
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Dark Page (TV Episode 1993)",One episode that touched my heart.,"Well, I´m reviewing TNG, now that I´m 38 years old, first seen at the age of 14.
So far, this was the only episode that deeply touched my heart, and I´ve ended up crying, tears don´t come out easily to me.
I´ve always found Lwaxana as a bit of annoying character, but not on this episode.
Star Trek was never about FX, Space Exploration nor Alien races... it was always about human complexity, and this episode explores one of the darkest fears.
I´d probably fallen asleep with this episode when I was 14 years old... but not now.",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Dark Page (TV Episode 1993)",A Sad Poignant Episode,"The final season of this series seems beset with the implications of telepathy and personal angst. The characters begin to reveal their inner selves more than at any other time. In this one Lwaxana Troi comes on board with representatives of a race, the Cairn, who communicate only through telepathy. Using technology, they are learning to speak, but it is a hard road to travel. From the beginning Mrs. Troi seems ill. She does her usual annoying judgmental stuff with Deanna (not being married and not getting any younger). She is subject to mood swings and anger. On board is a little Cairn girl played by Kirsten Dunst. She is a free spirit and embraced by the crew. One day, they are in a garden when this little girl falls into a pond. She jumps right out but Lwaxana collapses and the rest of the episode has to do with getting into her comatose subconscious. There is something there that is being repressed. The Cairn leader, who is attracted to Deanna and the father of the little girl, is used to send Deanna into Lwaxana's deep dream world. There is some sort of secret that must be rooted out. This is a really provocative episode, well acted and satisfying in its scope.",8
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Dark Page (TV Episode 1993)",A tragedy in the past of Lwaxana Troi,"This episode sees a group of telepathic aliens, called the Cairn, visit the Enterprise. They are accompanied by Counselor Troi's mother Lwaxana who has been teaching them how to communicate verbally and acting as a translator when they can't think of the necessary words. Deanna notes that her mother isn't her usual effervescent self; it appears that all the telepathic communication has been exhausting her. Then things take a turn for the worse; Lwaxana collapses into a coma just as one of the Cairn children jumps into the water in the ship's arboretum. Maques, the leader of the Cairns, says that he sensed a darkness in Lwaxana's psyche; this is explained as privacy, something the Cairn don't understand. It turns out to be something far more serious; she appears to be suffering from a mental trauma. To try to discover what that is Deanna, with the help of Maques, enters her mother's psyche and encounters many mental blocks before discovering a shocking truth that Lwaxana has been hiding since Deanna was a baby.This episode suffers somewhat from the fact that it is the second in a row which has key scenes taking place within a character's mind and after the weirdness of Data's nightmares the goings on in Lwaxana's mind are relatively mundane. The Cairn are typical 'almost human' aliens; this time ones with ugly bulges on sides of their heads; there is some mystery as we wonder whether they are directly responsible for Lwaxana's condition; it is of interest that Hedril, a Cairn child, is played by a young Kirsten Dunst, before she became famous. When we learn the real cause of Lwaxana's condition it is more tragic than expected and thankfully it is handled well. Overall this is a decent enough episode that would have benefited from being broadcast a bit later when 'Phantasms' wasn't fresh in the viewers' mind and it was nice to see Majel Barrett return as Lwaxana even if the character wasn't quite as extrovert as usual.",7
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Dark Page (TV Episode 1993)",The low rating for this one confuses me.,"The low rating for this one is confusing. It's the best Lwaxana Troi episode by far-- most of the shows that feature her are insufferably annoying. Story-wise, it was a great way for Majel Barrett to close out this character on this show (she reappeared in ""Deep Space Nine""), and she is at her best-acting wise as well. It's also much better than almost all of the GOOFY and tedious episodes that I've seen in this season so far.
It has great depth, and it shows the bond between Troi and her mother-- a bond that we will never witness again in Trek history. RIP, Majel Barrett.",8
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Dark Page (TV Episode 1993)",A different Lwaxana Troi,"To be honest, the Lwaxana Troi episodes are the only episodes of TNG and DS9 that I've watched in their entirety, except for one. (Of course, that could change.) I know some people don't care for Lwaxana, but I actually like her. She's quite funny, and while she annoys Deanna, is actually a good mother and sensitive person despite her flirtatious exterior. Out of the 9 episodes featuring Lwaxana, this one is probably my absolute favorite in TNG series next to DS9's The Forsaken and The Muse (honestly, I totally skip over Jake's story line in that episode...) In this episode, we see a completely different Lwaxana than the show previously featured, except for some choice moments in Half a Life. While she starts out driving Picard crazy as usual, her character instantaneously does a complete turnaround when looking at a very young Kirsten Dunst's character, Hedril, reminds her of something from her past. It's well done, as all around her can see something is clearly wrong, despite her assertions that she's fine. Although Lwaxana insists that it's just her ambassadorial duties of helping Hedril's race tiring her out, Deanna can tell it's more than that bothering her mother. A fact that she discloses to Will just before Lwaxana goes off on him and warns him to stay away from Deanna. Before you know it, Lwaxana is in a coma, and the only way to find out what's wrong is for Deanna to get into her mother's mind with a little help from Hedril's father. All in all, there are only a scant few humorous moments, as the episode is a poignant look at how the mind handles grief. Majel Barrett (who is great as Lwaxana anyway) was amazing at portraying an emotionally tumultuous Lwaxana. I would've liked to have seen more from her in both TNG and DS9.",10
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Dark Page (TV Episode 1993)",It only improves near the end...and then it really pulls at your heart.,"""Dark Page"" is a very odd episode. I really cared very little for it but by the end, I found myself being sucked into the show in its very moving finale.The Enterprise has some unusual visitors aboard. The Cairn are a race of folks who can read minds and aren't used to spoken language. Because of her ability as an empath, Lwaxana Troi has been selected to act as intermediaries with the Cairn. However, the more she works with them, the more emotionally taxing it all becomes. Eventually, she falls into a near-death coma. How does the Cairn's visit relate to all this?!I guess the bottom line is that although the episode is pretty slow, the solution to Lwaxana's problems is unusual and satisfying--though a bit draining as well. Plus, it does give you a chance to see a young Kirsten Dunst before she achieved stardom in ""Interview With a Vampire"" and other film projects.",8
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Dark Page (TV Episode 1993)",Just a bad episode.,One of the worst episodes for Star Trek the Next Generation. This episode set a new low for bad makeup effects for aliens. The obviously plastic brain like bulges over each ear of the aliens looked ridiculous. I'm guessing they must have used up most of their seasons budget on previous episodes. The shows budget limitations forced all or most of the aliens to a bi-pedal humanoid form; and that left them with a limited number of things they could do to try to make for different species. Add that to this over wrought cheesy story and that's what brought me to the lowest review I've given to a Star Trek TNG episode. I'm not clear on why the Lwaxana Troi is such a popular character. Majel Barrett always over acted this already over written characters. All the Star Trek fans just fall in line because of her ties to Rodenberry and the original show. All the episodes involving her and man Homm seemed silly and tediously boring.,1

Back on the Enterprise the Kes ambassador proves to be just as paranoid as the Prytt; when Picard and Crusher don't turn up at the rendezvous point he suggests that the Federation must be in league with the Prytt!This was an interesting episode thanks to the character development we get between Picard and Crusher; Patrick Stewart and Gates McFadden are on top form here and provide some genuinely touching moments as the feelings they have had for each other are exposed. The story about the Kes and the Prytt primarily serves to put Picard and Crusher in this position but is also rather interesting in its own right; it was fun seeing the paranoia of the Kes ambassador being exposed; starting with his being a bit over-concerned about being overheard leading to his completely bonkers accusations about the Federation allying itself with the Prytt.

Fleming, a medical transport that disappeared in this region of space. Soon, they discover who the culprit was - two aliens who have been disabling ships in this area to get the Federation to listen to their concerns - that the use of warp drives may be decimating their planet and destroying the fabric of space! A very intriguing ""environmental"" episode.Trivia note: Data's cat Spot is seen again, but in this episode and the upcoming ""Genesis"", he is now a she! Data also tries to train the cat throughout this episode, with varying success.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Force of Nature (TV Episode 1993)",Imposing a speed limit in space,"The enterprise has been dispatched to the Hekaras Corridor; a narrow corridor through an otherwise impassable area of space, to investigate the disappearance of a medical transport ship. Suspicion falls on a Ferengi vessel that had been seen in the area. The Enterprise finds the Ferengis but they appear to be dead in space. After a brief confrontation it emerges that they had activated a mine which had been disguised as a navigation buoy. The Enterprise investigates further and triggers such a mine soon after is boarded by two aliens. They are a brother and sister who claim that ship's warp engines are causing dangerous effects near their home world that will ultimately cause a spatial rift that could destroy the planet. Picard promises to forward their research to the Federation but that isn't enough for the sister she decides to prove her theory in a suicide mission that deliberately causes a warp core breach in her ship. The resulting explosion does indeed cause a rift and the medical ship is caught inside it; the crew of the Enterprise will have to find a way to rescue them which doesn't involve using the warp engines within the rift. In an early side story Geordi has difficulty while looking after Data's cat; Data tries to train it but his efforts have little effect; we also have another side plot involving Geordi trying to increase the engine efficiency as part of a rivalry with an engineer on another ship.This was a fairly disappointing episode; it starts with a rather unnecessary plot involving Data's cat that, while amusing at times, didn't really go anywhere. Likewise the subplot about Geordi's rivalry with a fellow engineer didn't add anything to the story. These aren't the main problems with the episode though; that is the overly preachy nature of the main plot. We are clearly meant to see a parallel with the problems caused by warp travel and pollution. We also have the unlike way that the female alien causes a rift to prove her point in a way that will probably affect her planet far more than the passing warp-powered ship. The resolution where a speed limit of Warp Five is imposed on the Federation seems to be something that could limit future stories although I don't recall this limit being applied in 'Voyager' and 'Deep Space Nine'. Overall a rather disappointing episode where the subplots go nowhere and the main story is overly preachy.",6
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Force of Nature (TV Episode 1993)",Preachy and not all that interesting as well.,"This episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" is obviously inspired by various social concerns during the last several decades. The plot is clearly a variation on a plot about pollution, global cooling and global cooling. Whether you believe or disbelieve the climate change theories, the episode just comes off as preachy and could have used a great infusion of energy and humor. It's just terribly preachy.When the Enterprise goes through a portion of space, it finds that it and other ships that recently went through this area were disabled--and soon it becomes certain why. A local race believes that the use of warp engines is damaging space--and they intend to put a stop to it any way they can. Well, the Captain is able to get one of these scientists to agree that the Federation should send scientists to investigate whereas his sister is insistent that the time to make huge changes is now and no one should investigate because she proved warp engines the bad. See the parallels to today?The show also has an underdeveloped plot involving Spot the cat. It really seemed tacked on--like a time filler. And, oddly, it was dropped from the show and never really addressed after about a third of the way into the show. The bottom line is that the script seemed a bit of a mess and lacked one important element--FUN.",3
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Force of Nature (TV Episode 1993)",The fragile fabric of space,"On a rescue mission to find and help a Federation science vessel lost in a part of space that is somewhat unstable, the Enterprise finds a brother and sister pair of scientists from Hecares who are disabling vessels in the area. They did this to the Federation ship the Fleming and to a Ferengi ship that the Enterprise also encounters.From the planet Hecares the Enterprise encounters siblings Michael Corbett and Margaret Reed who have been trying to convince the Federation and other warp capable aliens not to use warp engines in their neighborhood. Reed and Corbett are truly dedicated to their beliefs, as much as any earth scientist in our history ridiculed for their new theories like Isaac Newton or Louis Pasteur.In fact Reed's not willing to have the Federation scientists come out to study the problem after her ideas have to go through Federation bureaucracy. She makes her point quite dramatically.In this most serious episodes apparently it was decided that a little comic relief was necessary. This is provided by Brent Spiner discussing with LeVar Burton the methods of training a cat. I could have told them that cats are lovable, but not trainable. Data's cat Spot is one smart feline.Being a cat daddy, I had to like this episode.",6
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Force of Nature (TV Episode 1993)",Nice message but poor execution,"I really don't need to elaborate anymore. The title says it all.

Might wanna stick with Ayn Rand and stay in your wheelhouse.",7
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Force of Nature (TV Episode 1993)",A terrible attempt at an anti-pollution episode,"This was a terrible episode. And it would foreshadow the mediocre direction of Brannon Braga produced Star Trek. This episode was meant to make people think about pollution. But it used the fictitious warp drive as the method and created a story line that says warp speed was damaging space. All that was achieved was the very clear idea that Braga looked at his viewers as if they were children. This episode felt very much like some light made for kids show with superheroes giving us sermons of how we should live our lives. This show may have been a swing for the fences by Braga in terms of landing some sort of award like the Peabody. Whatever his goal, it failed miserably. Near the end the cast all take turns delivering political points on protecting the environment of space from further damage and the scene plays like a cheesy public service message. It is incredible that they did not have the actors go ahead and officially break the 4th wall and deliver a message to the viewers from Braga. And they may as well have done that since the scene was so obviously written to make Trek and the actors look politically correct and the lines seemed to come from the actors not the characters. This was very close to being The Next Generation's worst episode and unfortunately all of Braga's Enterprise and 75% of Voyager was far worse. Brannon Braga is to Star Trek as Joel Schumacher to Batman. Braga killed Trek just as Schumacher killed the 90's Bat-films. Both are two men with no talent or instinct for entertainment and should be kept away from it FOREVER!!",1
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Force of Nature (TV Episode 1993)",An inconvenient truth,"I've remembered this episode over the years (it's been a good twenty or so) for the eco-minded bombshell it unloads fairly early on. Turns out warp travel is ripping holes in the fabric of space, and Starfleet needs to take its foot off the gas. And that adds dramatic heft so instances where time is of the essence. Remember when Picard ignored his superiors in ""First Contact"" and ordered maximum warp to the Borg skirmish? He wasn't playing around. But now, the episode comes off preachy. It's all about the message and belaboring the point. And I still think it's an interesting point to be made, but maybe not with a sledehammer. 6/10",6
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Force of Nature (TV Episode 1993)",That Darned Warp Drive!,"This preachy episode involves efforts by a female alien to get starships to stop using a corridor in space. She claims the use of warp drive is damaging the fabric of space. To prove her point she destroys herself. The investigation into this is what this episode is about. The dramatic use of subterfuge to prove their point could made the brother and sister true terrorists. Of course, what they want is for the powers that be to listen to them before it is too late. This episode is really heavy handed. It would seem that their ultimate findings were quietly ignored. There are just too many unanswered questions in this presentation.",6
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Force of Nature (TV Episode 1993)",Dr. Serova is even dumber than they intended to portray her.,The premise of this episode is one that hinges on the stupidity of a character. Dr. Serova is already portrayed as irresponsible but we're also meant to take away that she's a genius who can see something nobody else can. She forces a warp core breach and sacrifices her life in the explosion to prove that massive amounts of warp energy will disrupt subspace and cause a rift that would prevent warp. She does this because the effect is supposedly cumulative and traditional warp engine energy is only a tiny fraction of the amount required to cause a rift. If that's the case then eventually it would become pretty obvious she was right as ship traffic continues over the years to come. She'd have been proven right eventually and likely with plenty of time to do something about it; all without her having to kill herself like a dummy. There was no reason to do what she did at all.,3
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Force of Nature (TV Episode 1993)",Same acting school or what?,"Michael Corbett as the Dr. Rabal character sure seems to be a dead ringer for Christian Bale. Is it possible he has a twin brother? Either that or he assumes this persona for TV work. Watch it and see what I mean. OK, I just found the episode on a popular video sharing site. That's Christian Bale with some clay glommed on his forehead. I am certain. Check out the voice and the mannerisms. It could be right out of American Psycho. Has anybody seen both these actors in the same place? If somebody can show me that I will alter my opinion. I can't say this strongly enough. Really, if they were ever in the same movie I would not be able to tell them apart.",7
10,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Force of Nature (TV Episode 1993)","Well, it's only ""preachy"" until you die because of it...","Seeing the ignorance and the political nature of most of the reviews on this episode, one can only come to the conclusion that humanity would deserve its fate when the environmental damage we all do on Earth will become critical. Too bad those responsible for the mess created won't be alive then to suffer the consequences, but their descendants will.I didn't expect this kind of opinions on this episode, especially since TNG primarily speaks to intelligent and open-minded viewers, who would supposedly understand that if you leave your trash in front of your home, it will eventully stink and produce all kinds of bugs and other... ""inconveniences"". It's the same with pollution on Earth and the same with the effect of the warp drive on normal space in the fictional TNG universe. By definition, a warp drive is warping space to move an object instead of increasing the kinetic energy of the object, by generating warp fields to form a subspace bubble that envelops the starship, distorting the local spacetime continuum and moving the starship at velocities that could greatly exceed the speed of light. It's similar to folding a thin piece of metal, to get one side next to the other. Now, even children know what happens when you quickly and repeatedly do this to that thin piece of metal: it eventually breaks - just like paper is easier to tear in a straight line after folding it and the same as space does after being repeatedly ""warped"" (i.e. folded) in the same location(s) by starships. Bottom line, there's nothing ""preachy"" about the scenario in this episode, just like it's nothing ""preachy"" about the fact that pollution or deforestation are endangering life on Earth - it's simply the truth.So, what can you do faced with these close-minded, bureaucracy oriented and irresponsible people, who would either not believe or not take or delay any measure to alleviate or correct the damage? You'd do what the alien's sister did in this episode, sacrificing safety for understanding and appropriate reaction. Maybe the reviewers who considered this fine episode ""preachy"" need to experience the same - there's nothing more convincing than having to fight for survival. It's up to the viewers to connect the dots and realize the similarities between what happens in this episode in a fictional world and what already happens or could happen in our very real one.

This makes her in essence, Data's ""mother"".However, Data soon wonders why he has no memory of her and why she would never attempt to contact him. Soon, Data notices stranger things about his ""mother"", things that are all too familiar for him.Trivia note: we see Dr. Soong again, this time as a middle-aged man (he was a young man in ""Birthright"" and an old man in ""Brothers""). Lore and the Crystalline Entity are mentioned again here too, and we also see a painting of Data's ""daughter"", Lal. We also find out that Data ages (he has an aging program).AND, Juliana mentions that there were 3 android prototypes before Lore (perhaps B4 from Star Trek: Nemesis was one of them).",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Inheritance (TV Episode 1993)",Mom's the Word,"I liked that this episode kept me engaged. It could have been maudlin, or it could have been the story of a couple of con-artists. As it is, Data begins to accept his ""mother"" as worthy of that name. It seems, on the surface, that this woman was married to Dr. Soong privately, away from her parents. This secrecy is necessary to the plot. She was there at Data's inception, and even had to make a harsh decision to leave him to his fate in a crisis. She has always regretted this. There is a subplot where his mother and her current mate are trying to stabilize underground links on the planet. She seems to be smarter than her son when it comes to this technology. She also has an outstanding musical talent and plays a really difficult piece with Data. This episode is nicely played out and quite acceptable in the canon. It appears that the producers of the show decided to make this season about personal turmoil and inner awareness. This is certainly a positive.",9

He works well with her and he plays well with her, Spiner and Flanagan bounce off each other with Robotic Precision.But Data discovers that the connection is more Positronic than Organic, Dr. Juliana Trayner is a little too fast when working with computers and even more so when playing music with him. This gives Data the false impression that she is also a Soong-Type Android, like he is.But she is not quite the same - For one thing, she is not as sturdy as he is, and is damaged when Data pushes her off one of the many rock faces we see in Next Generation.For all intents and purposes, she is the same person as the one she was built to replace, and even possibly an improvement on Data himself - She has emotions, she fools Medical Scanners into thinking she is Human, she has sweat glands, breathes, has tear ducts, and ages like any other ""real"" person. This episode also reveals that Data was built to ""age"" as well. And, finally, Data knows beyond a doubt that he is no longer Unique in the universe. But he cannot share this discovery with Dr Trayner. Embedded in her Positronic brain is a holographic chip which Dr. Noonian Soong had put there in case anyone discovers her true nature - Particularly Data. And so this episode is the fourth and final ""Data"" episode, and the last TNG appearance of ""Dr Noonian Often-Wrong Soong"". It bookends Data's History with solid answers, now we know why and how he was left on a slab to be discovered by Starfleet on Omicron Theta- At least the reason the Juliana-Android stated. In Reality, the human version of her had been injured fatally by the Crystalline Entity.Fionnula Flanagan is one of my favourite actresses, and I was pleased to see her here, and later in Deep Space Nine. I had seen her in all kinds of 80's television, but this was one of the best parts she had ever played. One of the best 7th season Next Gen Episodes.",10

Data unsure about her but they grow closer as she tells him about his early life and how his memory had been wiped after an awkward childhood and eventually admits that it was her choice to abandon him when the Crystalline Entity attacked their world. Eventually Data learns a shocking fact about his mother something it turns out he suspected.This is another character driven episode which gives us an interesting insight into Data's past. It also serves to remind us of things seen in previous episodes as Data tells his mother about Noonien Soong's death and shows her a painting of his 'daughter' Lal. As well as such touching moments there are some amusing scenes too such as when Data's mother assumes his visit to Troi is part of a romance and when she tells of how he refused to wear clothes when first activated. Fionnula Flanagan puts in a fine performance as Data's mother and as expected Brent Spiner is great playing both Data and a holographic representation of his father.

She also talks about Lore and mentions that there were other android projects. However, as they continue to get to know each other, Data notices some inconsistencies--making him wonder exactly WHO she really is.This is a decent episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""--as are most Data episodes.

1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Parallels (TV Episode 1993)",The FRINGE Episode of ST:TNG,"Or, ""There is more than one of the road not taken""This episode of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION follows a plot device used in the series FRINGE. Mainly, the possibility of Alternate Universes and the ability to traverse them.In this Ep, as in FRINGE, the traversal of alternate realities is at first not intentional. In fact, Worf has no idea this is what is happening, until several iterations later, an alternate DATA figures it out. As possibly, so did the Data from ""Our"" (Or rather, Worf's Reality).This ep follows a theory of Quantum Flux, partially that ""all matter in a universe resonates on a quantum level with a unique signature"" - And Worf is not exhibiting the correct Quantum Signature for the Universe he is in. This also happens in the 2nd season of Fringe when Peter Bishop is perceived by Olivia Dunham to be resonating with the signature of matter from the ""Alternate Universe/Other Side"". What is causing Worf to ""Flip through Universes""? This episode is very disarming and disturbing.In Fringe, this is explored within the realm of two, possibly Three Quantums/Alternate Realities, in this episode, we are dealing with hundreds of Alternate Trek universes, possibly an unlimited amount. We are shown Trek universes where Picard was killed by the Borg, and Riker is the Captain of the Enterprise, with Trombone and all in the Waiting Room. And Worf personally experiences finding out that he is married to Deanna Troi - And has Children in one universe with her, and never fathered Alexander! And there are Cardassian Ensigns rather than Bajorans serving on the Enterprise (A male Cardassian Ensign is seen Piloting the Enterprise, instead of Bajoran Ensign Ro Laren).Mostly this Episode is based on the phrase: ""Everything that Could happen, DOES happen"". - This episode reveals, the existence of a Quantum Fissure, a fixed point in space and time that intersects all Quantum Realities - And Worf's Shuttlecraft has flown right through this point, causing him to be susceptible for transference from one Quantum to the next. At first the universes are very similar to ""our"" Trek 'Verse, later in the episode, the differences become apparent, sometimes drastic. As the Data from Worf's last Quantum Shift states: ""For Any Event, there is an Infinite Number of Possible Outcomes - Our choices determine which outcomes will follow. But there is a theory in Quantum Physics, that all possibilities that can happen, DO happen, in alternate Quantum Realities"".This episode is an excellent exploration of that Theory, a graphic illustration of this- As Worf traverses the realities and is exposed to different choices made not only by him, but the other Enterprise Crew.This is precisely the kind of writing that is used in the Fox series FRINGE, and is a major part of the story in seasons 2 through 4 of that series. But in 1994, we had this Trek episode, a surprisingly well written episode by trek writer Brannon Braga who was always kept on hand to come up with ideas- He had hit his stride in Next Generation, some of his scripts and stories were not well written or received (Braga was the one who ""Destroyed the Enterprise D"" in Star Trek: Generations) but this one episode stands out as being very clever writing and a good fulfilling story. Braga would have fared well for Fringe with ideas like these.Some Trek fans surmise, that Trek was running on pure ""Brownian Motion"" all through it's 7th Season, but this episode plainly proves that there was still some innovation in Trek writing in S7. And we also must give Michael Dorn some credit for his acting in this ep.",
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Parallels (TV Episode 1993)",What is happening to Worf?,"After winning a batleth competition Worf returns to the Enterprise and a dreaded surprise birthday party. Shortly after cutting the cake something strange happens; he has a dizzy spell then is handed a slice of sponge cake, this is strange because he had just cut a chocolate cake. He shrugs it off but starts having more dizzy spells and each time something different changes. At first it is small things; the picture Data gave him, the fact that he came ninth rather than won the competition, then he couldn't compete at all. Later still things get radically different; Riker is commander of the Enterprise and Worf finds himself married to Troi! Investigations eventually show that his shuttle passed through a spatial anomaly and the after effects have left him bouncing between various realities; returning to the anomaly leads to the realities meeting and numerous alternate versions of the Enterprise appearing. If things are to be set right they will have to identify which of the thousands of ships Worf came from so he can take its shuttle back into the anomaly.I really enjoyed this episode for the very reason I suspect others will dislike it; as things changed for Worf I liked the confusion as things kept changing in ways that only Worf, and the viewer, notice. As well as the obvious changes there are enjoyably subtle changes such as the way the com badges change in later realities. For most of the episode there is also the question as to whether what we are seeing is really happening or if it is something being done to Worf for unknown reasons. Michael Dorn does a fine job as Worf; nicely portraying his confusion and frustration as reality changes around him. This story hints at a possible future romance between Worf and Troi as he comes to see her as potentially more than a friend it will be interesting to see how that develops. Overall an enjoyable episode that keeps one wondering what is really happening.",9

First of all, there is the matter of time distortion and parallel universes. Secondly, there is the human (Klingon) development on board the ship. Worf has many lives, set in motion by random acts. He even has a marriage and children with Deanna Troi. Objects and events scatter about and he is the epicenter and the control in everything. Because of the open mindedness of the crew, he is able to at least get, what would seem a ludicrous theory, listened to. He has returned from a Klingon martial arts tournament, victorious, but in one scene, his trophy for first place morphs into one for ninth place. What I found most entertaining is that I hadn't seen this condition before and the conclusion is quite acceptable. Michael Dorn as Worf does a nice job as the focus of this episode.",9

It's actually kinda scary when a Klingon battle cruiser shows up and your tactical officer is drawing a blank. The camera tricks and editing keep you on your toes, and the story keeps shifting.

The scenes with Worf and Troi work surprisingly well, thanks in no small part to Michael Dorn's facial expressions.Speaking of faces, Wesley Crusher makes an appearance, looking like he's aged about a decade more than the rest of the crew.

But it gets more extreme and one of the changes finds Worf married to Counselor Troi! Oddly, Worf is the only one who is aware of these changes.On IMDb, this is a very highly rated episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". I assume this is because you get to see all sorts of alternatives for the characters--such as Worf getting married and many other changes. However, I really hated the show because it was so reliant on so much stuff that just sounded like a lot of mumbo-jumbo--with talk about fissures in the space-time continuum, lots of quantum realities and an inverse warp field.

Troi's performance is decent, but the Worf, Troi romance never made since like the Worf, Dax relationship in DS9.I did like the idea of the bat'leth tournament. Too bad no one ever wrote an episode about that. In the future Star Trek should focus on aspects of the unique cultures it has created.

But also what makes this episode unique is that it's focused on Worf. This is really something different for the character as we see him actually play the detective role, which I thought was interesting and a change of pace from his usual role of being a combatant.Worf is really sympathetic as we are in the same boat as him asking all of the same questions like ""What the hell is going on?"" and ""How does he get off this ride?"" Each of these different enterprises Worf inaventantly travels to each one, where we see their different from the smallest details from simple decision, what occurred and what didn't.Down to even the biggest details like seeing Comander Riker commanding the enterprise which is sort of prolific as he does get to command a ship of his own the U.S.S. Titan in the expanded universe books. But also seeing Denna Troy and Worf as a couple which I'll admit I never thought would ever happen but they way it's handled it really felt plausible, I really liked seeing the chemistry between both of them how Denna interacted toward him I actually bought it.

One of the highlights of the episode is seeing Riker get yelled at, separately, by both Picard and the admiral. Any viewer who's ever been caught in the crossfire between their boss and the boss' boss will certainly relate.While I'm generally not into nitpicks, this one is too good to pass up: In one scene, Riker and the admiral are discussing the Big Secret in Ten-Forward (a.k.a. the ship's bar), making sure to emphasize that nobody must find out about it...within earshot of at least a dozen people.

I like Star Trek, and I just finished re-watching TNG because of the disaster that Discovery is, but you know what, this series is just as hypocritical and preachy. I did not catch this when I saw it originally as a kid, but now I can see where the writers of Discovery got their inspiration. Still no excuse for all their other failings, but I can forgive them about the preachiness since it seems to be part of the Trek DNA. So that's my only complaint with Trek in general.

It isn't long before suspicions are raised about the Pegasus's final mission as we see Riker, who was a young ensign on that mission, and Pressman talk about 'The Experiment' and the possibility that it may be restarted. We then learn that there was a mutiny aboard and Riker was one of the few people to stand by his captain. When they get to the site of the Pegasus they find a Romulan ship is already searching the location; Pressman is determined that they don't get their hands on it but he is also determined that destroying it will be the last option. Eventually they find the Pegasus deep within an asteroid; fused with the rock. The Enterprise is taken in via a narrow fissure but are trapped when the Romulans 'accidentally' seal the way out. To get out they will have to use 'The Experiment' a phased-cloaking device that will enable them to pass through solid rock but is strictly banned by treaty.This is a fine episode with plenty of intrigue; as soon as 'The Experiment' is mentioned I wanted to know what it involved the fact that it was so secret that Pressman ordered Riker not to mention it to anybody, including Picard, made it sound somewhat sinister. It was interesting to learn more about Riker's past; not only about the events on the Pegasus but also the reason why Picard selected him to be his First Officer. Riker's forced secrecy causes a degree of tension between him and Picard and at times threatens their relationship; both professionally and personally. Guest star Terry O'Quinn does a fine job as Pressman even though we can guess that his character is a wrong-un almost from the moment he is introduced. It was great to see that some within the usually all too perfect Federation are willing to break the rules. If the episode has a real flaw it is the fact that there is no explanation as to why there have been no further attempts to create a cloaking device in the previous twelve years.

Today, capable of carrying nuclear tipped ICBMs, they are the most powerful weapon in our military today.So, why on Earth would you, as a leader of some futuristic space nation, deny your armed force this capability? And, on top of that, allow a foe who has sworn to destroy you, have that same capability which you've agreed not to have?It's just another notch of stupidity in a show that claims to be high brow, but is, in reality, a lame brained excuse to look at psychological issues, even when the plot doesn't make sense or has massive loop holes and other forms of illogic in the story.I just can't wrap my skull around why this show continues to get praises for lapses in good thinking. Could not the plot have been reworked to show a deficiency in cloaking technology, or some more pragmatic idea to show why Star Fleet doesn't use that Romulan gizmo?But no, instead the plot and logic thereof or unimportant. According to the producers what's important is that the emotional clash between officers and the idea of a mutiny on a starship for idiotic story reasons. Production values are first rate; sets, acting, makeup ... eh, the SFX are a little lacking but passable, but aside from that, the story is flimsy. If you're going to postulate a mutiny on a volunteer service vessel, then maybe you can ash-can your ivory tower sociology mind and take your ego and shove it some place dark, dank, and full of foul odor, because the condescension here reeks of idiocy.Reason; you mutiny because you're captain is abusive, immoral, unbalanced, and has put ship and compliment in danger. Not because he's breaking a treaty. Treaties are broke all the time. It's the scale and impact that's important.

Essentially, his view would be that if a culture hasn't developed space flight capability on its own and a planetary disaster falls upon them, they should be allowed to die off.Clearly, that view flies in the face of the Original Series episode ""All Our Yesterdays"" where the Enterprise tried to save some of the people of the planet Sarpeidon when its sun was going supernova. Star Fleet had ordered Kirk to rescue at least some of the people there, people who had not developed space flight capability.So with the precedent already established in the Original Series, Picard's strained view simply doesn't hold any water especially since Worf's brother came up with a fairly ingenious way to transport the people without impacting their culture.",2

After all, everyone likes different things. As for me, I really liked this one and thought it brought up some interesting points.Dr. Nikolai Rozhenko (Paul Sorvino) is working on planet as an observer. The locals believe he's one of them and he's become a part of their community. While this is a bit odd and skirts the limits of the Prime Directive, it gets worse. The planet is doomed and will soon be bereft of all life. The Prime Directive calls for non-interference but Rozhenko is determined to do ANYTHING to insure the continuation of these nice people. But they know nothing of space travel and he cannot simply take them aboard a Federation ship to resettle them elsewhere...and the Prime Directive would indicate that he leaves them. However, against Picard's express wishes, Rozhenko beams the few survivors onto a holodeck simulation that LOOKS like their shelter on the planet below and they THINK they are all still there! Now what? Oh, and to complicate things, Roshenko is Worf's step-brother!!I liked the show because it stretched the limits of the non- interference policy of the Federation. And, as I watched, I thought the Captain and the crew were incredibly callous (annoyingly so) towards the folks on the planet--so I liked seeing Sorvino, who is not a Starfleet officer, throw the policy out the window! Pretty interesting and well written.",8
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Homeward (TV Episode 1994)",The flaws in the Prime Directive,"When the Enterprise receives a distress call from Worf's brother Nikolai, who is observing the natives if Boraal II they learn that the planet is about to suffer the total loss of its atmosphere. Nikolai is determined that they must save some of the native population but Captain Picard is adamant that the Federations Prime Directive means that they must be left to die. Nikolai doesn't take no for an answer and beams a group of Boraalan into the holodeck, which he has programmed to simulate the caves they were sheltering in. Picard is furious when he learns of this but as he can't beam them back to a now dead planet he agrees to transport them to similar planet. To avoid the Boraalans learning that they are on a different world they create a program that will enable them the trek from the simulated caves to a simulation of the site of their new village; with gradual changes in the terrain as they go. There are some problems when the holodeck starts to malfunction but Worf, who has been subject to surgical alteration and his brother describes as a seer, makes up excuses that they believe. One problem can't be explained though one of the Boraalans wanders away from the group and exits the holodeck; no amount of excuses can explain what he sees; will he be able to return to the others; if he does and he tells them what he has seen it will either change their society forever or he will be treated like a madman.This episode has a good basic idea; I liked the idea that a group of people is to be transported to an entirely different planet without their knowledge and Worf's various excuses for strange goings on were rather amusing. On the other hand Picard's insistence that they must not interfere with the Boraalan's 'natural development' even though that means they would be extinct in a few hours went beyond being officious and cold hearted; it was like watching somebody calmly watching a child drown while saying how sad it was then being furious when somebody else rescued them. This could have been justified if by the end of the story the idea that the rule about non-interference being absolute was questioned but we just know that if he encountered an identical situation again Picard would have the same reaction. Overall this episode has some good ideas but I can't say I enjoyed it as the actions of major characters made me angry.",6
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Homeward (TV Episode 1994)",Poor writing indeed.,"To add to what ShogaNinja said, Picard expresses a lot of anger at Nikolai for creating this situation and coming up with such a ridiculous solution. Then at the end of the episode Crusher asks Picard if he regrets saving the tribe and he says ""No, and our plan worked perfectly."" Even though the tribe now believes in a magical Worf and some God called ""La Forge"" the same way the proto-Vulcans in ""Who Watches the Watchers"" believed in ""The Picard."" I thought Nikolai's use of the holodeck was rather brilliant but the line of BS he came up with sell it to the tribe was utter lunacy. ""Duck inside your tents and my brother will make the storm disappear!"" Won't they be questioning him for the rest of his life about his magical brother? Why not just knock them out with some gas and then later say the storm dissipated while they were asleep?The episode also entirely avoids the ethical question of letting someone die rather than violate your policy of non-interference. The Prime Directive is supposed to prevent them from negatively impacting another culture. Since the only alternative is the extinction of that culture does it really apply? Wouldn't a culture influenced by alien visitation still be preferable to no culture at all? This episode really makes Picard out to be a puppet of Starfleet dogma. I'm reminded of Jor-El's words in the 1979 movie, ""Is it now a crime to cherish life?""",3
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Homeward (TV Episode 1994)",Bad Writing,"This episode is full of suppositions, plot holes, and really bad writing.We meet Nikolai, Worf's foster-brother, the son of his Russian foster parents who we have met before and who also currently raising Alexander. When Nikolai introduces Worf to the village he tells them that Worf is his brother. Yet none of these suspicious people were chiming in with "" well, why is your skin different colors then?"" Yet later we are to believe the one guy is a little TOO inquisitive and finds his way onto the Enterprise. mmmmhmm. UNLESS they are an alien race that skin color is variable upon birth. There seemed to be wide demographic makeup in the village to support this theory.Then they come back and get un-surgeried, only to turn around and be ordered back INTO surgery to get facially altered AGAIN within hours. Geez. If it's that easy why doesn't everyone look like supermodels? They could have made Dr. Polaski sexy?They should have never been tricked by Nikolai in the first place... for many reasons. A:The crew is experienced, they have dealt with ferengi and Q alike. What's this one man compared to that? B. His intent was obvious to anyone and he had a motive which he displayed openly. C. Deanna Troi would detect his intent in about a nanosecond. D. Even through the convenient ""interference"" they would have detected that the transporters were being used - they have logs for a reason. E. Who operated those transporters? A civilian scientist who doesn't know his way around the ship, or that it had a ""new"" holodeck, one who failed out of the Academy in the first year. Hardly good enough to make such precise calculations to aim all of them into the holodeck unbeknownst to them. And how would he know when they were all asleep anyway?Later the Captain is informed that they have to hurry because the holodeck is losing stability. Why not fix the other holodecks and transport them over in their sleep or whatever?Then they just let him go? Why not make him stand charges as a civilian? They do have laws about that for civilians I'm sure too. It was never even discussed only that ""You're career is over!"" We can't have civvies going around and changing the universe whenever they feel like can we? Treating the prime directive like a suggestion? Rule of thumb? Wives' tale?There was one funny moment in this episode and that was when that woman told Worf they should be family because she is pregnant with his brother's baby. His reaction is HILARIOUS.There was just too many conveniently lined up variables that make up this craptastic episode all created by the writer/s. All to further some really inconsistent and bad writing and squeeze another one out before the finale. You may actually find yourself making fart noises while you watch this episode. (In the end when they pretend they are brothers who reconciled. lol.)With the series coming to a close you think they wouldn't waste time filming a stinker like this one. 5/10 (hey it's still TNG)",5
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Homeward (TV Episode 1994)",Inferior Episode,"Paul Sorvino guest stars, playing Worf's dangerously careless brother, Nikolai (born of two human parents). He has embedded himself with a group of people whose planet is doomed. They have taken refuge underground, but their days are numbered. Because of the prime directive, Picard refuses Nikolai's request to save them. Brother decides to go it on his own, using the Holodeck as a holding place, causing these people to believe they have not left their planet. To get to the point, he forces Picard, et. al., to search for a planet that can sustain them. They will then be beamed down as they sleep. There is a slip up when one of them escapes the Holodeck and must be dealt with appropriately. This is such a hare-brained scheme to start with that it really pushes the limits of reality (even for science fiction).",6
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Homeward (TV Episode 1994)",Would have been great if not for the prime directive nonsense,"I really liked Paul Sorvino as Worf's brother and the conflict between them seemed genuine except for the ridiculous interpretation of the Prime Directive, which is the Federation policy of non interference in a society that hasn't developed warp drive. First, Picard has broken that rule many times in the past. Maybe he's evolved, become more conservative in his old age? That still leaves the interpretation of the directive in the first place, which, to give them credit, they do address in the episode. Supposedly it's not about allowing societies to evolve on their own, it's about ensuring noninterference. But the point is to allow a civilization to develop naturally, so if the whole planet is going to be destroyed, what's the point in enforcing the Prime Directive? They didn't debate this much at all in the episode, which made the rest of the story feel a bit contrived. Troi of all people was the one defending the use of the Prime Directive to justify letting this civilization be wiped out. It seemed out of character for both her and Picard, who got really angry at Worf's brother simply because he was trying to save a doomed people. That shaky foundation as the premise of the episode really took a lot away from it and could have been avoided with a bit more creativity in the writing room. But if you can get past that, it's a pretty good episode.",6
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Homeward (TV Episode 1994)",Several viewers don't get it...,"One of the rules in telling a good story is breaking the rules that you have set within that framework. It creates tension. So if you create rules such as ""the prime directive"", imagine all the fun you can have when you break those rules, telling a great story. What a bore, without that tension. Much like the majority of the first 2 seasons, which lacked those conundrums.Oh! And it's fiction. Some have forgotten that fact.",10
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Homeward (TV Episode 1994)",The Prime Directive can get a bit much sometimes,"I have to say that I was with Paul Sorvino on this one. The choice he had to make
for the primitive tribe he was living and studying with is rescue them or let them
perish. But that old prime directive says let things occur. That wouldn't sit with
me either.Sorvino plays Worf's human foster brother for as you remember during Worf's
formative years he was raised by human after losing his Klingon family and 
Sorvino is a bit of a rebel. He's not in Starfleet so prime directive means nothing to him. I say bully for what he did.He got the Enterprise to transport the whole tribe and the idea is to use hollow
decks to make them think they're still on the planet while Enterprise transports
them to a new suitable home. And Michael Dorn who is all about honor and
duty and order being obeyed is aghast at his behavior. The two have some edgy family scenes.Still this is one really great episodes of TNG especially after one of the tribe
escapes the hollowdeck and wanders on to the Enterprise. Paul Sorvino is one
actor who is never bad in anything he does. He's outstanding here.",8
10,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Homeward (TV Episode 1994)",older than me..,"Star Trek: The Next GenerationRoddenberry's second creation of an elite group exploring space through humanity is a remarkable milestone for not only television but the sci-fi genre itself. As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 07The seventh act of the series seemed like an overstretched material where the writers were clearly running out of ideas, although to balance it properly, there are few brilliant concepts that defines the ingenious of Star Trek.HomewardIf I look back and see some of the dull episodes, somehow most of them turn out to be an episode set in historical period piece that actually comes with a lot of setup of the characters and subplots in order to advance further, add it to the list.",

It seemed to be a pity episode thrown to Gates McFadden, to put her in the lead role. The main impression I got from the episode was ""Crusher's orgasms."" That seemed to be the main focus of the episode, Crusher being seduced, repeatedly. The actor who portrayed Ronin did a decent enough job, and the alien Scotsman was a great character. But all in all the storyline was very weak and the good acting could not make up for the script, which was even worse than anything Anne Rice has ever written. This episode seriously detracted from the overall quality of season 7. I had partially blocked this episode from my memory when it first aired and had not seen it until recently, while watching the entire series on DVD.

All of a sudden, Beverly is willing to leave behind her career to spend her life with Quint. And now its up to her crew mates to save her from making a terrible choice.That is the nuts and bolts of it. And what we are left with is perhaps the worst TNG episode of the entire bunch, and a excellent character (Crusher) is making choices that seem completely out of place, even for someone as her. And Gates McFadden, who's done well in stories that were centered around Crsuher, tries her best to hold everything together.

But is seems that the lover is a ghost that haunts the family and now Beverly is next in line. And supposedly the ghost has the sexual prowess to convince Beverly to resign her commission and start a new life on the Scottish planet. And all his power comes from a candle that Beverly was warned about at the beginning of the episode.It will be easy to blame this episode on Gates McFadden but the fault should be squarely on the writers. They tried to make this a sexual episode that would appeal to women thus bringing them into the fold of the series.

However, to call this episode the worst surprises me because the episode is very true to sci-fi. In my view, sci-fi is about taking an issue be it moral, ethical, social, etc. and creating a medium where we can think about and discuss that issue outside of our preconceptions. ST:TNG ""Half a Life"" is one that immediately comes to mind. ST ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"" is also very good with ST:VOY ""Living Witness"" (too preachy) and ST:VOY ""Critical Care"" (conveniently sidesteps the issue) being examples of not-as-good.In the end, ""Sub Rosa"" is about the gray area that can exist with regards to drug use and addiction. Several generations of Dr. Crusher's family have been used as a host by this alien for hundreds of years, but in exchange they received happiness and pleasure beyond all imagination. The alien doesn't kill them or physically harm them in any way and in fact, all of Crusher's family lived very productive lives as doctors in the colony. This is the thought that Crusher is left to consider at the end of the episode.So that's the question. How bad would it be exactly if someone shed all of their personal relationships in favor of an addiction? How bad would be it if they were truly very happy and were still able to live a productive life? Crusher: ""You've been using me, [...] my entire family for centuries!""

Soon afterwards an elderly local warns Beverly that the house and in particular the candle are cursed but she throws him out and lights the candle anyway. Soon she starts having erotic dreams about Ronin and eventually sees him; we learn that he has been with the women of her family since the seventeenth century is he a ghost or something else? While Beverly is busy being seduced by Ronin the colony is suffering a problem with its weather control system; a problem that spreads to the enterprise.Unfortunately this is one of the weaker episodes of TNG; it doesn't start well when Picard tells the colony's governor that the settlement reminds him of the Scottish Highlands and the man proudly replies that is contains stone from Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen fine Scottish cities but not in the Highlands! The inhabitants are some of the worst clichés of an outsiders' view of Scotland that anybody who has even visited the Highlands will find laughable. The story itself is just about okay but the attempt to mix a Gothic ghost story with science fiction doesn't quite work; it is hard to believe that Beverly would be seduced so easily or that her colleagues wouldn't have noticed that something was wrong sooner.

It all seemed very contrived as soon she was caught up in what was a Gothic Scottish romance combined with a paranormal story. While this combination MIGHT work, putting it in outer space and on this series was awfully bad. What follows is a ghost-like story along with LOTS of heaving bosoms and perplexing romance. All in all, it was just god- awful and Gates McFadden didn't do much to help this story.UPDATE: By the way, it isn't just me who hated this episode.

The main issues arise with it taking strong, established characters and throwing everything out the window, particularly the strong female characters of Crusher and Troi. Beyond the fact that this story is out of place and feels completely tacked on, the characters act so counter to everything we've learned about them over the previous six years. What logic exists for how Crusher can not just be so easily overpowered into succumbing to some odd entity but allows herself so easily to slip into such an absurd fantasy situation. And Troi just kind of lets it all go, like she doesn't have any misgivings or Betazoid intuitions? ""Oh, you got turned on by your GRANDMOTHER'S WRITINGS? Don't see an issue there."" It's asinine. The only explanation offered for such a sudden and dramatic change is ghosts. Seriously. Ghosts. Asinine. Yes, weird, supernatural things occur all of the time on the Enterprise, but through it all, the characters remain true to themselves. That is the difference. Here, they don't. They completely abandon themselves, and there is no excuse for that. The writer attempted to shoehorn characters into a contrived narrative, a poorly forged story, and the only way to make that work was to make the characters into something opposite from what we know them as. Honestly, I'd youre watching TNG for the first time, skip this episode and go to the next one, which is so much better than this one. This is one of the true low points of the entire series.",3

This last element is the most interesting, the rest is actually rather stupid and more 3/10 territory, especially a rather tacky resurrection sequence. The first thirty minutes or so will have you thinking ""there is no plot here"", and that is sort of true, apart from an 800 year old ""ghost"" trying to seduce Beverly Crusher, nothing actually happens apart from some whacky weather. The romance elements are rather predictable in all honesty and the idea of combining the genre with space opera is really a matter of personal taste, which might be why so many people find this thing plain awful. What salvages the episode is its treatment of female sexuality, utilizing Crusher and to a lesser extent her conversations with Troi.

A semi-gothic ghost story in outer space, with Dr Crusher getting all hot and bothered. In my more caustic moments I have been known to describe the less riveting TNG episodes as 'a bit like social work in outer space' but this is something different again. This episode sits incongruously alongside the usual TNG fare, so naturally some fans will just hate it. On the other hand the few 10/10 reviews each have their reasons. According to one, if you happen not to like it, that would be an attack on female sexuality.  I found it moderately interesting but not especially compelling; since there are plenty of TNG episodes that are like that (if you try enough slightly different things there are bound to be a few that fall flat) then it shouldn't come as a massive disappointment if you happen not to like it.in point of fact a few things did irritate me, but they were not the ones you might expect; first there is a character that has an accent that I can only describe as belonging to an Irishman who has been told to talk a bit Scottish; a more mangled sound you have never heard. Second when someone is attacked and they fall over, they are immediately declared 'dead' with no attempt whatsoever made to resuscitate them. Very un-TNG, that. It isn't explained how the Howard family line even came to be; the candidates are alien incest or more than one relationship, I suppose.
There also isn't much of a sub-plot in this episode; I thought that such things were almost compulsory.

Of course, there was a suspension of disbelief necessary but that's true of all sci-fi (TNG included).What I enjoyed the most was the setting/production design (I've been to Scotland and it is a magical place), as well as what I considered to be a thought-provoking ending which raised some interesting questions about the nature of love and the meaning of relationships.In any stage form, whether it be theater or television, the best stories/episodes are the ones that touch you in a unique way. This episode was definitely one of those.Anyway, kudos to the production team as well as the writing team. In my opinion, they all deserve some long overdue praise.",8
17,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Sub Rosa (TV Episode 1994)",All Aboard the Sub-Rosa Subway,"I'm glad the writer of this Ep posted here and explained it a little. Nothing is more offensive than to create something and have that creation attributed to someone else.Now, the basic story may contain elements similar to the Anne Corn Wheat Rice story, but this Ep has nothing to do with VampyreGhostLycans and things of that nature. Although it does deal with the Supernatural, in the case of Star Trek: The Next Generation, all things Supernatural are also Scientific and, most importantly, Speculative.This Episode has to do with Scotland... With the bloodlines of the Women of that land, tracing Dr. Beverly Crusher down through the ages to the Howard Women of that land, possibly to Mary Stuart herself. And so this puts Cheryl ""Gates"" McFadden in the same Limelight as other famous redheads, including Katherine Hepburn herself.The look of the Ep is very Non-Trek, they used a location that was very much Scotland. A Whole Planet Scotland! This is what is wonderful about Trek, because somewhere in the cosmos, is a whole planet Ireland, and a whole planet Africa (This was explored in the first season episode ""Code of Honour"" and the planet Ligon II) - And so, just for this Ep, we have a whole planet of Moors, and Crags, and we can envision Clan Macloud eventually settling there.I agree there are some Religious overtones here, but they are represented as Tradition, during Felisa Howard's funeral.Now, as a Trek Ep, we already knew that Ronin was not a Ghost. Ronin was a good name for the Character, although not an Unemployed and Honour-less Samurai, pretending he is a Ghost. But the speculation of what he actually is, the kind of Life Form he is, and that he had lived with Crusher's ForeMothers through the Ages, is just interesting.This Episode expresses Regret, because after all that happens and the decision Beverly has to make, we see after all she regretted having to take that step. And that we share that feeling of loss at the end, makes this Episode one of the best of the series, and certainly an example of a well written Trek story. It is too bad that the writer was never allowed to write any more tales for the Trek Universe of the time.",10
18,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Sub Rosa (TV Episode 1994)",This was a GREAT episode,"Something I've always hated about Star Trek, since the ORIGINAL pilot, where Gene Rodenberry's wife played the First Officer, was Rodenberry's predilection for having female characters who were supposed to be brilliant, strong, and independent, but....were all carrying a torch for a man that...sigh...they'll never, ever have.Number One (the First Number One from the FIRST pilot), in love with her captain.Then Rodenberry's wife again, as Nurse Chapel, in love with Spock.Then Deanna Troy in love with Riker, who was (and this is saying something) a bigger horndog than Kirk ever was. OH! And don't get me started on the Troy/Worf romance. Worf actually went to ask Riker PERMISSION to date Deanna! Are you KIDDING me? Here's a news flash, boys (because I'm guessing it's 100% males who've written these awful reviews of this episode): If a guy I'm ""dating"" ever has the nerve to go ask a guy I used to ""date"" for permission to ""date"" me, guess what? Them two can jolly well go ""date"" each other, 'cause I ain't no damn pink slip for a car that they can pass between them with a dollar bill and a notary public seal.yes, this episode showed Beverly enjoying herself - a lot - and often. Women's sexuality is dismissed and subjugated and forbidden and looked on askance in the US's Puritan-centric society. Women aren't supposed to succeed, in any area, even their own sexuality. Don't believe me? Look at the champions at the Brasil Olympics these past two weeks: they were women, but their men (husbands, fathers, coaches) got all the credit for the women's incredible accomplishments. One woman didn't even get her NAME mentioned when she medaled - she was headlined as ""the wife of a Chicago Bear""!Well, tough, boys. Real men support real women and their interests. Beverly is a real woman, with real feelings - including sexual ones. Too bad you don't like seeing a woman enjoy herself.Brava (that's right, NOT BravO) for this episode. Loved it. So did most women Trek fans, but y'all don't really want to hear that, do you?I feel sorry for the women in your lives.If you don't like this episode, don't watch it. Watch the violent ship- and civilization-destroying ones. We don't complain when you watch those; in fact, we also enjoy them.

Shortly thereafter, Beverly finds herself taken with image of this guy. He is able to come and go. He is able to enter her body as a kind of energy wave. She obviously is experiencing him sexually.

This lead to some very poor quality control in what scripts were accepted.. It was submitted by a totally unknown script consultant who ripped off a very bad Ann Rice story about Scotland and an incubus like creepy ghost.That's some horrible quality control. if you've never seen this, don't waste you time.

As far as I can remember, I've enjoyed every one of his directorial episodes.Then there were the occasional glowing reviews. So I sighed, and decided to give it a try.A great episode? I wouldn't say so; and yet......the script, the direction, the performances were all so enjoyable.

Here the producers allow us into the fraternity behind the scenes. The young officers on the way up. One in particular, a young woman who was part of the careless activity that got Wesley almost drummed out of the academy, sees all her work nearly stifled by her past. This is her story of ascendancy and her story of risk. After Picard tells her she has no future, she comes to a conclusion to ditch the past and take the gifts she has accumulated and move forward. She goes on a mission of tremendous risk to become what she hopes to become. A sensitive episode.",8
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Lower Decks (TV Episode 1994)",New recruits that brought a little TOS charm with them,"'Lower Decks' is in my top 5 favorite Star Trek Next Gen episodes. A must-see ep for everyone. There were several things that made Lower Decks work, IMO.The first thing they did right was instant characterization of these new recruits. This was something TOS did well. On any given episode, if you heard Scotty say a line, you knew that he was a hard-working, extremely capable, slightly cantankerous, individual. If you heard Spock say a line, you knew he was a very intelligent, scientifically-minded, misfit. If you heard Chekhov say something, you knew he was a plucky, young, happy-go-lucky type. Whenever they showed up on the screen, we fell in love with them (again). (Aside: I think this is one reason why JJ chose to use the TOS characters for the ST reboot films, rather than the characters from any other incarnation of Trek.) The characters in TNG, by contrast, were less well-defined, and less distinct from each other. We eventually learned who they were, but it had to happen over the course of many episodes (seasons, even).The Lower Decks recruits had a little of that TOS magic in that, every scene we saw them in, they revealed who they were and made us fall in love with them. When we saw Sam Lavelle trying to hobnob with Riker and mistakenly calling him a Canadian, we knew that this was a kid with big plans, he was gonna go places, he was a bit of a brown-noser, and boy was he wet behind the ears. When we saw Taurik's cold, dry, wit when addressing the ""roommate"" issue, we knew that this was an irritating, cynical, cold-blooded individual who didn't care what other people thought of him. (The head-butting between Lavelle & Taurik also reminded us of the similar, uneasy, relationship between Spock & McCoy, which made me reminisce.) When we saw Sito Jaxa sparring blindfolded with Worf, we learned that this was a young girl who wanted to prove herself, and wasn't easily duped. At last, she did get a chance to prove herself by helping the Cardassian to return in the escape pod. We were saddened at her loss along with the rest of the Enterprise crew when Picard announced she had been killed.Another thing LD did well was giving everyone a chance in the spotlight. This is a hard thing to do with a large, ensemble, cast. They did it well in ST4 by giving every member of the crew a job they needed to do to help get a humpback whale back to the future. The three young recruits all had their individual moments (Taurik with La Forge in engineering, Lavelle with Riker, Jaxa sparring with Worf), and their occasional ""come togethers"" (playing poker midway through the ep, sitting together in Ten-Forward remembering Jaxa at the end). It also helped that in their individual/""spotlight"" scenes, they connected with a TNG crewmember that we already knew and could foil off of them.It's just a pity that these recruits didn't become the cast of Voyager.",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Lower Decks (TV Episode 1994)",Behind closed doors,"This was one of the best episodes of Next Gen's seventh and final season. In this we see young officers ,all ensigns and are vying and working hard to be promoted. The competition between them was enjoyable and fun and the constant flashes and comparisons with what is going on with the senior officers was interesting and not done before in this manner. There is a sub plot to this and Ensign Sito played with style by Shannon Fill is picked on by Picard because of a misdemeanor a couple of years before this in the Academy which resulted in the death of a cadet. When Worf, who sees real potential in Sito gives her a wake up call she confronts Picard and he is pleased that she had the courage to come forth and stand up for herself. When he explains that he needs a Bajoran officer for a special mission into Cardassian space she quickly volunteers. The mission ends in tragedy however, and the young officers mourn Sito's death together in Ten Forward. Worf eventually joins the ensigns and the newly promoted lieutenant Lavelle and sits with them in a touching scene which capped a brilliant, what happens on the lower decks episode.",10
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Lower Decks (TV Episode 1994)",Those noble officers not on the bridge,"I'm pretty sure I'd only seen parts of 'Lower Decks' over the years, and seeing it in its entirety was an eye-opener. A creative look at the lower-level officers that populate the Enterprise, it also reframed the main cast (those all-too-familiar faces we see from week to week) as administrative department heads. Yeah, it's kind of a workplace episode. And as each character achieves clarity throughout the story, a fluffy ending is almost guaranteed; that is, until a late-hour plot twist turns that right on its head. Highly potent stuff.9/10",9

At the same time, a Cardassian defector arrives on the ship. How will these two plots intersect?This episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" is rather unique and I liked it. In many ways it's a bit more soap opera-like than some, as it is more about personalities than a big plot. One reviewer described it aptly as like ""Upstairs/Downstairs"". Exactly what happens to these eager young crew members is something you'll need to see for yourself--and the ending is a bit touching.",9

Specifically, they focus on Nurse Ogawa (played again by Patti Yasutake and who finally gets a promotion to Lieutenant), Sam Lavelle, Sito Jaxa (again played by Shannon Fill from the 5th season episode ""The First Duty""), and Taurik. And it turns out that Sam and Sito are up for the same job! An intriguing episode because we get to see how others on the Enterprise handle themselves - especially those struggling to get ahead with their careers and what is necessary to do so.Trivia note: again, Riker and Troi work together on the crew evaluation reports (the last time they did so was 3 months ago). We also find out that the Ten Forward waiters are civilians not Starfleet. The 4 young crewmembers are seen playing poker, at the same time as the senior officers. And, Ambassador Spock is also mentioned.",
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Lower Decks (TV Episode 1994)",Excellent,"As a Junior Enlisted officer in the military, this has always been one of my favorite episodes. It was excellent to see how the lower ranks (decks) reacted to what those above them are doing, and how the upper ranks react to what the lower decks do. Ensign Sito Jaxa was a favorite character and I really wish she would have returned or her fate determined over on DS9. She would have been a welcome addition (and perhaps a foil/protégé for Kira). I would have rather seen TNG go onto another season rather than go onto the big screen. All in all, this is one of the best episodes TNG ever did. It's too bad they didn't do more episodes showing what was going on with the lower ranks. (or that it took until O'Brien was on DS9 to give him his own pips).",10
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Lower Decks (TV Episode 1994)",Evaluation time,"As this episode opens in Ten Forward where Riker and Troi are discussing the latest crew evaluations, which will determine which ensigns are promoted to lieutenant. Across the room four young ensigns look on wondering how things are going for them. As the episode progresses we see these characters interacting with members of the main cast; Dr Crusher tells Nurse Ogawa that her promotion is virtually in the bag; Taurik, a Vulcan, appears to irritate Geordi with his ideas for improving efficiency, Sam Lavelle is convinced that Riker has got it in for him and Sito Jaxa is championed by Worf. It is the last of these characters who proves to be most important; she appeared before in 'The First Duty' and Picard tells her that he thought she should have been thrown out of Star Fleet for her part in the events of that episode it later transpires that this dressing down was part of a test to see whether she had the backbone to stand up for herself when unfairly treated. When she passes she is invited to take part in a top secret, and potentially very dangerous, mission that requires a Bajoran to play the part of a Cardassian prisoner.This is a superior season seven episode; the way it concentrates as much of junior characters as well as the main cast shows us another side of life on the Enterprise; instead of concentrating on those already in important positions it shows us those still struggling to be noticed and get a chance for promotion. It is fun to see how each of them deals with the situation and when the later plot involving Ensign Sito's mission it is interesting to see how they deal with the fact that they can't talk to their friends about everything anymore; being able to keep secrets from those closest to them is just part of the job. The way the junior officers activities mirror their seniors in handled well; we see both groups relaxing in Ten Forward and at other times playing poker. The cast do a fine job with the guest stars holding their own amongst the established cast; this is particularly true of Shannon Fill who puts in a sensitive performance as Sito as she has to deal with some rather unconventional tests prior to her mission. Overall this was a top quality episode with a surprisingly downbeat ending.",9

is Dan Gauthier who is convinced that Commander Riker is out to deny him any
way he can.But Bajoran Shannon Fill has a different kind of hurdle and that's with Patrick
Stewart. Going back a couple of seasons she was part of a group of cadets at
Star Fleet Academy that included Wesley Crusher who covered up some dereliction of duty. Captain Picard took that incident to heart because Star
Fleet Academy is close to his heart. He makes it blunt that he doesn't like and
is waiting for her to screw up so he can bounce her off his ship and maybe out
of Star FleetBut life takes a funny old bounce and it turns out its Shannon Fills who has
unique qualifications for a dangerous mission.The confrontation scene with Fills and Stewart contains some of the best

Commander Troi finds Beverly on duty on the bridge and starts to wonder about applying for promotion to Commander herself. This won't be easy; not only are the exams rigorous they are also administered by Riker it might not be easy to be judged by a friend. Meanwhile Data is on a relatively primitive planet to retrieve radioactive parts from a crashed probe. Something has gone wrong though and he finds himself in a local village having lost his memory. Having no notion of beings from other worlds the locals quickly decide that he must be an 'Ice Man' as he comes from the north. He is befriended by Garvin and his daughter Gia, who gives him the name 'Jayden'. He pays his way with the radioactive metal fragments he was carrying and soon people start getting ill. He retains enough knowledge to research a cure but his task is made harder by a group of frightened natives who think he is the direct cause of their illness.Of the two stories shown in this episode Data's is by far the more interesting; having him lose his memory in the way he did created an interesting situation as it meant his ignorance about the metal he was carrying is understandable but still had the scientific reasoning to find the cure. The community he visited was fairly typical of the series; a small community that is fairly friendly but also blames the outsider as soon as things go wrong. Brent Spiner does a fine job portraying Data; while he is noticeably not his normal self he is only subtly different in the way he behaves he still works logically through the problem and doesn't ignore the possibility that he may be the cause. Troi's story seems more of a time filler but it isn't without merit; there are some enjoyable scenes between Marina Sirtis and Jonathan Frakes, as Troi's tests are supervised by Riker. The ending of this story was a little disappointing; Troi gains promotion when she realises that command may involve ordering people to certain death it would have been more interesting if she had declined to promotion when she realised this it would be nice to have a main character acknowledge that there are somethings they can't do rather than learning they can do whatever is required.

He begins to work on a cure because while he can't get all his memory back, he seems to have maintained his scientific knowledge. He comes to realize that he is the true cause of the sickness and associates it with the metals he has given for a small price to a metalworker. One the Enterprise, Deanna has begun to feel she has reached a dead end and begins to study to move up to Commander in rank. Apparently, it doesn't take much to attend the bridge in a position of authority. This subplot aside, I find this a really well thought out piece of science fiction.",9
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Thine Own Self (TV Episode 1994)",Data and Troi define themselves,"In the case of Data in that a bombardment of radiation has crashed his Positronic Net. For Troi in that she has decided to become a Bridge Officer and will take the Command test.It becomes clear that only Data's short term memory and identity have been affected, not his ability to learn and adapt. In ""Eye of the Beholder"" Data tells Geordi that when faced with a choice between erasing his Brain or letting his brain adapt naturally to his upper data storage limit of ""800 quadrillion bits (100,000 TB)"" and possibly Malfunctioning, he chose the latter despite the risk. In this episode, the former has appeared to have happened: His Brain seems to have been erased.But it appears that Data still has the experience he garnered in the years since his activation: He knows that various combinations of Elements comprise Matter, and that objects don't really have ""Fire/Air/Water or Earth"" in them simply because they are hot, or a Liquid, or are a Vapor or are hard like a stone. He also has his rational, reasoning mind and his ability for Language- Even though he has forgotten the Context of his language.Because he has forgotten the context of the word ""Radioactive"" a dangerous material gets distributed into a Pre-Industrial colony of people, a people who although are interested in the Scientific Method, have not quite learned how to discard their religious and spiritual biases.And it is making these people ill, and the more ill they get, the more fear and loathing they have for ""Jaden"" who they have labeled as an ""Iceman"" - Using the Label as a derogatory reference and the De-Facto cause of their ills.Meanwhile, Troi is able to pass the basic menial parts of the test, but she can't seem to get one particular aspect of Command - One which she had been forced to grapple with in the 5th season, 5th Episode ""Disaster"" and she was the highest ranking living Bridge officer left, forced to take command. In fact it was that very ""Disaster"" that had caused Troi to seek the Bridge Officer's test, so why can't she remember the basic tenet of Command which she had to face back then?The answer is in her face, but because she is not really in that situation while being tested, it eludes her, until she catches on to Riker's Clue about the First Duty of a Commander.Data himself has to face a test of the same sort, only in his case, he uses the inverse of the solution to the Bridge Officer's test, or rather he applies that solution to himself.Down on the planet where ""Data/Jaden"" is, there is a feast of great Character Actors: Mike Hagerty is ""Skoran"" - You will remember Mike from ""Redemption, part II"" as the ""Piece of Bak-Tag"" that tried to kill Worf and Kurn, but who Kurn evaporated using a warp-induced Solar Flare. Same kind of guy here. Ronnie Claire Edwards aka "" Corabeth Walton"" in The Waltons is Talur, a Teacher who claims 'Scientific Method' but who in fact uses Witchcraft to explain her world and how it works. But the best, is Kimberly Cullum as ""Gia"" - Another little girl who gets attached to Data like Sarjenka (Nikki Cox) in Season 2 ""Pen Pals"".These character and child actors were the life's blood of The Next Generation. Used in this episode, they create a Trek ""Planet"" episode that is realistic and believable. And once again Data saves a Little Girl and her whole town, but in this case, he is the one who gets his memory wiped of the incident. So in a way, this episode bookends ""Pen Pals"" in both the A and B story- Troi is the one extending her limits as Wesley was in Pen Pals, and Data once again defies the Prime Directive to save a girl he cares for, although he will not remember it.",10

As it quips repetitively, it dares go where no one has been before, and analyzes the good and bad of the nature. And it's that wide range of nature that is touched down, in all its hokum that it calls for, the answers are overwhelming to all the questions thrown out to it. Unlike the previous series, it has much more characters to handle which is a double edge sword. On the pro section, it helps writers jump in on diverse categories through them and swoop in as much as material possible through their individual perspective and still keep it all inside a definite and familiar circle.On the other hand, it also is challenging to fiddle around these many characters on screen, especially the amount of new contents and eerie ideas each episode comes up with, it increases the possibility to lean towards flaws. And yes, it has its own limitation, but in its own gullible range and potential, it just simply works. Plus, what's fascinating is despite of being brimmed with these many personas floating about in the space, they haven't allotted any stereotypical specific characteristics to the characters, their species and nature may definitely vary, but a cheesy note is strictly prohibited in Enterprise-D.The infamous Capt. Jean-Luc Picard played by Stewart who is mostly known by this role from his career, is exceptionally well crafted character that is simply nothing but a good leader and add Stewart's performance to that, the outcome is your iconic character that survives decades easily. Sirtis as the consciously enhanced counselor fits perfectly in the ship and the makers makes sure either they keep her up front to notify the shady part of the plot or distracts her wisely to advance the plot.Frakes, once again, a competent leader and warrior that is more explored into love affairs while Dorn as a hot head and Burton as the most adapting and willful learner on the ship helps make the environment more engaging and realistic. Spiner as the android, Lt. Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 07The seventh act of the series seemed like an overstretched material where the writers were clearly running out of ideas, although to balance it properly, there are few brilliant concepts that defines the ingenious of Star Trek.Thine Own SelfThey contradicted me on my theory that usually historical set pieces are often dull, I am glad that they have finally gotten the mojo back by correcting their own mistakes and as far as the plot is concerned, it is a bot lost in a virtual reality, it is not Matriz but it sure is gripping.",

At least the Captain has been shown to be a true student of archaeology, a cosmic interpreter of mythology, an intergalactic Joseph Campbell. This gives him some sort of credibility. However, the whole thing bogs down when the creature/creatures become true forces. The solution is so simplistic. The conclusion is the worst of any episode I've seen. Watch at your own risk, although Brent Spiner is quite wonderful with his use of voices and his physicality. His Commander Data is one of the most entertaining and creative characters in all of science fiction.",4
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Masks (TV Episode 1994)",Not the worst-- but damn close!,"Some are comparing this episode to ""Sub Rosa"", but for me the nadir of the series has always been ""The Neutral Zone"", an episode where literally *nothing* happens. I can't rate this one as worse, but it gives it a good run for its money. At least this episode *has* a plot. But you can search high and low and never find one with a plot that makes less sense.Let us summarize: some giant alien space probe with super-advanced technology that well outstrips that of our heroes starts *slowly* transforming the Enterprise into a model of its home world, while filling Data with the personalities of its *primitive* religion. Our heroes must stop it from doing this before the ship is completely transformed and they, presumably, die (no life-support systems or anything). Data's personalities gradually reveal some kind of vague story about the sun god killing everyone because the moon good is inexplicably absent to keep her in check. So in the end Picard decides to role play the moon god, and, voilà!, the probe instantly puts the ship back to normal.And the reason that the aliens built a probe to do *that* is....?Take your time trying to come up with a plausible reason. You won't find one.And by the way, what would have happened if it had been the U.S.S. Lollipop that had wandered by instead of the Enterprise, which did not conveniently sport an android among its crew? With no android to play the parts of the probe's various characters, what happens then? How are the Lollipop's crew supposed to solve the ridiculous ""puzzle"" that the probe requires in order to not destroy the ship?This episode is a bad crossing of ""The Inner Light"" with ""The Royale"". At least in ""The Royale"", they provide a plausible explanation of *why* it is necessary to act out the fiction to the end.Yes, as someone else stressed, Brent Spiner gives an excellent performance as all those alien personalities. But this is balanced by the rest of the crew being simply *awful* as a bunch of inept and impotent losers. Only Picard has *any* idea of anything to do, and all of his ideas ridiculously involve trying to solve the alien personalities' problems rather than his own. That is to say, *his* problem was never Masaka, it was the alien probe! By any logic, he ought to have been concentrating on doing something to disable or escape the probe. He had absolutely no way to know that putting on a mask and role-playing some mythical god figure would make the probe somehow magically put the ship back together again.It is my natural inclination to focus on plot problems, and this episode has more than its share. But I would not want to give the impression that that is the only problem with this episode. The writing is terrible. Some of the dialog is just painfully bad. Wince- inducing.This is an episode that just gets worse with each viewing. I admit that the first time I saw it, while I didn't rate it highly, I didn't realize how awful it is.

The one thing I truly loved about this episode, was that it gave Brent Spiner the ability to truly demonstrate his acting ability.Any actor that can portray multiple personalities, and do it in a way where you believe that each persona is a unique and different individual, truly is a great actor. The emotional struggle, between the competing personalities was also portrayed in a believable way.It's been a while since I have watched this episode, so I can't go into more detail about the story-line... but reading the negative reviews, I felt I had to say something in its defense.Spiner's performance in this episode has always stayed with me!",8

If they could have built that, why not build a spaceship to carry them away? It seemed like a lot of the parts of the episode were cut out - in the other episodes there were much better explanations of what went on. In this episode they really skipped out on explaining the significance of the characters Data played - names that ihat was the comet, masaka as a star going supernova (at least, that is what it seemed like to me), her father as the discarded remains, etc. I just wish they had taken more time to explain it.",8

But if we can be honest about this particular episode, then this show was lacking in so many ways. And after watching the episode on two occasions, this was more about the many acting abilities of Brent Spiner than an entertaining view by the public.When the Enterprise investigates a passing comet they find inside a mysterious religion facility deep inside the comet. Somehow the passing facility invades the Enterprise's computers plus Data's computer mind making the facility able to communicate with the crew by means of several strange characters that are projected through Data's computer brain. While the Enterprise is being transformed into a ancient alien city, Data's computer mind will hold the key to how Captain Picard can communicate with the forces that are holding the Enterprise.Brent Spiner did his best at playing several characters but it was not enough to make the story interesting. In fact it was distracting seeing Data change into so many characters in which some had no relevance to the on-going problem the crew was facing.Thinking I may have missed some important information during my first view, I watch the episode for a second time. Much to my chagrin the second viewing was worse than the first. Nothing had been missed. This was an uninteresting and confusing story that had little action and even less sense. Even being a fan of the series, this was one of the poorest offerings in the entire collection.",2

I've seen some things that have made me roll my eyes, but nothing as bad as this episode (yes, Dr. Crusher's episode ""Sub Rosa"" was pretty dumb, but her sexiness cancels out much of the dumbness.).In this episode a floating alien library starts turning the Enterprise into an Aztec/Mayan temple. This is done through the ships computer, so Data is also affected. Data get's multiple personality disorder and becomes a couple of members of this ancient culture. Picard talks to these personalities for clues on how to stop the ancient goddess. (As an aside, there is a scene where only 20% of the Enterprise is still left ""unchanged"". The big 4: Picard, LaForge, Riker, Troi, are trying to decide whether or not to enter a certain symbol into the computer. Hello?! The Enterprise is almost completely transformed into a frickin' temple! Is there an alternative?) In the end, Data becomes the sun goddess (yes, a goddess). Picard puts on a mask of the moon god and convinces Data (as the sun goddess) that she is tired and must ""relinquish the sky"" to the moon god so the ""hunted may become the hunter"" and the hunt can continue. Data agrees, and everything goes back to normal.Picture Picard wearing a Halloween mask. Patrick Stewart is a great actor, and I enjoy watching him perform, but I was laughing AT him in this episode. Ugh! This is not an episode that I need to watch again ... ever.Picard, out.PS - This is a pretty scathing review. So why did I give it a 4?

The writing was so bad that I had look away at times and the plot was just plain stupid. Why would someone create a station like that in space and to what purpose? But the worst thing with this episode is the stupidity of Picard. He is supposed to have studied ancient cultures but he does not get that it is the moon that can put the sun to sleep.

The biggest problem with this episode is that it really could have been more interesting, an alien civilization is dumping artefacts everywhere. Why? We never find out!

The Enterprise's latest mission is to investigate a rogue eighty seven million year old comet; as the ship draws alongside and starts scanning something strange starts to happen; objects start appearing aboard the ship; odd symbols are on the computer screens and Data becomes more creative. It isn't long before stranger things happen; a symbol appears on Data's forehead and he takes on the personality of somebody who warns that 'Masaka is coming'. As the story progresses Data shows more and more personalities and an attempt to investigate what is in the comet leads to the discovery of a large structure. More and more parts of the Enterprise are converted into what looks like a South American temple; if they are to stop the entire ship changing they will have to find 'Masaka' and then discover how to make her leave.Despite all the negative reviews I rather enjoyed this episode although I can see why others didn't. I liked the idea of the archives of an ancient culture being hidden within a very old comet and there was a sense of mystery as various artefacts started appearing on the Enterprise. The highlight though was seeing Data possessed by various personalities the always reliable Brent Spiner excels here as he gets to show a greater than usual acting range. The way he warns that 'Masaka is coming' was rather creepy even if every time Masaka was mentioned I though the name sounded too like 'Moussaka'! The ending was a bit disappointing as the Enterprise reverts to normal almost instantly once Masaka is dealt with. Overall the episode may not be perfect but it is far from the worst episode and if nothing else it is worth watching to see Data's various possessing personalities.,7

In the episode, Data suffers similar effects as the Enterprise, only he is taking the personalities of ancient people. Several personalities, which Spiner seamlessly transitions into in a way that seems so natural and effortless. It is truly a pleasure to watch. Brent Spiner is quite the actor, and it was refreshing to see him show his stuff!It is truly worth the watch for his performance alone, and it is a shame they couldn't develop the plot to match his dynamic.

Soon, more objects appear on-board and the ship appears to be transforming into a ship for this alien species.

Kwan, a partial empath, does so. Now, the Troi investigates and must deal with the aftermath of it and figure out why he would do so. In fact, she finds out that Kwan didn't seem like the type to take his own life, and soon she is flooded with empathic memories from the Utopia Planitia shipyards WHEN the Enterprise was built 8 years ago!How is Kwan's death and Troi's memories related? Find out what happened and will happen!Trivia note: Starfleet gives its okay for the Enterprise to exceed the Warp Speed limitations that were established in ""Force Of Nature"". The first months after Data became sentient, he also pondered suicide. And, the Worf/Troi romance takes further hold here as Worf asks for Riker's permission.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Eye of the Beholder (TV Episode 1994)",A suicide aboard the Enterprise,"After a young lieutenant commits suicide by jumping into the plasma stream in one of the nacelles Counselor Troi and Worf are put in charge of investigating what led him to kill himself. Initial investigations show no obvious reasons for him to end his life; in fact everything suggests that he was happy and his life was going well. The pair return to the point where his death occurred and as Troi stands where he stood; she suddenly feels dizzy then sees the room as it was when the ship was being built. During this dizzy spell she sees a woman being attacked, the face of a red-haired man and a couple embracing who start laughing at her. When she comes to she wonders if something terrible happened in the room back when the Enterprise was built which left some sort empathic echo as the man who killed himself was also partially empathetic.This episode was a little disappointing mostly due to the fact that it ultimately becomes that most of what we have seen is part of a telepathic vision rather than anything that really happened even if the case is solved in that vision is was disappointing. This also meant that Troi's night with Worf never happened clearly the writers want to tease the viewers about that possible relationship. If this doesn't bother you the mystery of what happened during the ship's construction is fairly interesting and the 'red-haired man' is rather creepy.The fact that Capt. Picard stated that this was the first suicide on the ship and the fact that ultimately the man who killed himself did so because his telepathic abilities made him live through another man's crime rather than a more usual reason meant the episode failed to deal with any real issues concerning suicide something rather surprising given how 'Star Trek' has dealt with many real issues over the years.",6
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Eye of the Beholder (TV Episode 1994)",The ending ruined the episode.,"This is one of those episodes written to give Marina Sirtis full work in an episode instead of her usual four or five lines. And you can guess it even before viewing, it will involve Counselor Troi using her telepathic powers to find why an event happened. And in this case we have a suicide, by Lt Kwan, and she is set to investigate so the family can have some answers. And during her investigation she has an empathic experience about an event that happened many years ago as the Enterprise was being built. So now we get story where Deanna, by her telepathic powers, can view into the future and possibly solve a mystery of why the young Lt. Kwan committed suicide.We all know that the writers try their best to spread the story-lines so that each character is featured in at least one or two episodes a season. And I feel sure that writing for Marina Sirtis character is difficult. But in this story it goes far overboard making her telepathic powers and the following story confusing and bothersome. At the end of the episode it gets all summed up by a play on words that is difficult to understand. When the reason for the suicide and other actions are revealed, it all seems so made-up that the story was for naught. An otherwise nice story that seemed rush to conclusion. This is one time the ending ruined the story.",4

The plots revolves around telepathic abilities, one of my least favorite aspects of the Star Trek universe. I like my science fiction at least somewhat grounded in science rather than pseudo-science. I grudgingly accept Troi's abilities when presented as extremely sharp intuition but when presented more like a true psychic ability I can't help but be skeptical. The plot is something of a who-done-it. I don't want to discuss the details because they aren't very interesting. But I can say that the ending is poorly scripted. The first time I saw the episode I didn't even fully understand how much of the episode the ""reveal"" covered... almost the whole thing.",4

This brings in the expertise of Deanna Troi, who uses her empathic powers to try to feel the events leading up to the taking of life. In the process, she witnesses what appears to be a rape/murder and she seems to see this from the rapist's perspective. Worf is paired with Deanna and during this time a romantic relationship develops between them. It seems that something happened at the time the Enterprise was being constructed. The problem with the episode is that there are some issues with what is real and how the characters ultimately react to those implications. Deanna has a more substantial part here and does a decent job with it.",7
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Eye of the Beholder (TV Episode 1994)",So Much Potential; So Badly Done,"It stinks that an episode with this much promise would be so poorly executed.In ""Eye of the Beholder"", an officer commits suicide, forcing Deanna and Worf to investigate his death. This ultimately leads to their romance, one of the better, late story-lines of the series.Unfortunately, it's hard to decide what's more annoying - the poor acting of the officer's fiancée (who apparently called it quits after '00, mercifully) or the clunky dialogue, surprisingly written by series wunderkind Rene Echevarria. Deanna and Worf's first love scene in particular seems to come out of left field, and ruins what would otherwise be a great one, with its intriguing plot and en medea res opening. A great story that ultimately goes to waste. Big disappointment.",4

Counselor Troi tries to piece together why all this happened and soon finds herself pulled into the same things that caused this other empathic crewman to kill himself. So is she next?The only element of this episode I particularly enjoyed was the new relationship between Troi and Worf. However, like Worf's glimpse into the possibility of such a relationship in an earlier episode (one with MANY different realities), this one turns out to be unreal. Will the pair later become a pair?Otherwise, I disliked the show because the ending seemed to come out of no where with lots of bizarre elements which make the viewer say 'what?!'.

0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Genesis (TV Episode 1994)",Badly executed plot supported by terrible science,"I can't decide whether this or ""Sub Rosa"" is the worst episode of the season.Honestly, who thought that this story would be entertaining in any way? In addition to having plot holes big enough to fly the Enterprise through (e.g. Where was Alexander during all this? If the disease started in sickbay, why are Worf and Troi the first to be affected? When did Spot get a sex change?), it simply wasn't very interesting to watch, unless you enjoy seeing the regular actors wearing ridiculous make-up shot with cheap-horror-movie lighting. And because this is a reset-button story where nothing that happens will have any consequences on the characters (even the final scene mocks the notion that the previous 44 minutes happened), this episode really has nothing going for it.And now I'm going to be self-indulgent and pick apart the ""science"" of the show, because I feel like it. Let's start with the term ""de-evolving"". No. Just no. The term is ""devolving"". Of course using the correct term would not have saved the science. If something causes your DNA to change, you will die. Period. And the notion that a T-Cell did it is even more ludicrous because T-Cells are about 4,000 times larger than DNA strands. Writer Brannon Braga obviously did SOME research in an attempt to make his idea halfway believable, but it was not nearly enough. Seriously, why bother with all this pseudo-scientific gobbledygook that doesn't even make sense within its own framework, much less in any plausible vision of the future? Why not just say a ""magic potion"" transformed everyone into creatures and back again? It would still have been bad, but at least a little less tedious.If you are not a Trekkie and you see this episode, please don't judge the series or the franchise by it. At least see a classic episode like ""Lower Decks"" or ""The Best of Both Worlds"" before making up your mind.",2
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Genesis (TV Episode 1994)",Star Trek TNG 'Genesis'. Brilliantly stupid.,"This episode is retarded. The writer of Genesis, Brannon Braga, clearly has little-to-no knowledge of Biology. Piccard, Riker, and Barclay are all clearly human, yet Riker turns into a proto-human, and Barclay turns into a spider? Spot, the cat, a mammal, mutates entirely into an Iguana? Genesis is probably campier than most of the original series.That said, this is without a doubt among my favorite TNG episodes. TNG was a fantastic series, with some great, complex story arcs, but compared to the original, it maybe took itself a bit too seriously for a show about people who time-travel and fight aliens. Genesis was clearly a slight horror-movie spoof, with the crew slowly going mad, before out-right changing into ""de-evolved"" (not ""devolved"") versions of themselves, leaving Data to figure out wtf is going on, while Piccard begins to show symptoms himself, while a savage-super- venom-spitting-Worf takes out Crusher with his savage-super-venom and tries to hunt down Troi, and have bitey, and probably lethal savage-super-sex.It's a ridiculous and campy plot, but it's fun and the actors get to have fun with the characters.",10

And Picard begins to exhibit the same signs! Watch what happens in this exciting episode.Dwight Schultz returns as Lt. Reginald 'Reg' Barclay III (an even more hyper version of himself). Dr. Selar is mentioned again. We see an Enterprise bathtub. Patti Yasutake also returns as Nurse Alyssa Ogawa - this time pregnant! And so is Data's cat Spot!",
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Genesis (TV Episode 1994)",Barclay's Proto-morphism Syndrome,"""Gates"" does an incredible job of directing this Ep - Which takes the plot element of a Medical Conundrum and mixes it with an Homage, either deliberate or Accidental, of the film ""Alien"".Of course, it is all Barclay's fault - This guy is an even worse hypochondriac than I am. I think all of us at one time or another, read too many Medical Journals, and have developed symptoms equivalent to things we had read about. Even so, this is Dwight Schultz' Penultimate Performance as ""Barclay"" - And his last in The Next Generation until his cameo in Star Trek: First Contact.This Ep had some great Makeup effects, very realistic. Except for Worfs feet, at 12 minutes and 23 seconds, take a look at Worf's foot, this is not a Klingon foot, we saw Worf's feet in the episode ""Ethics"". Of course Spot might not have ""Devolved"" into an Iguana, but it would not have been cost effective to use makeup on a Cat. But to see Barclay as a Spider, Riker as a Cro-Magnon man, Nurse Ogawa as a Neanderthal, and Troi as a kind of Newt-Woman (Which of course was another nod to the Alien/Aliens Universe, as there was a character named ""Newt"" in Aliens) - Was enough to satisfy my Trek Injection of the time, as I saw this Ep First-Run.The homages to Alien were done very well, especially the finding of the Shed Skin, and Worf's denting of the Sickbay Doors, and although his makeup looked more like ""Predator"" - Well, it is still an homage to Alien. There were some very startling moments in this- Two specifically I can think of, but I've put enough Spoilers into this. It is too bad the Series ended so soon after, ""Gates"" should have helmed more Eps - She mastered this one, Probably all of Riker's directing ability rubbed off on her.We can thank Braga again for this story, another one of his better ones. At least he didn't blow up the Enterprise D in this ep (yet)- Or turn the Borg into Wimps. One of the stronger stories of the 7th Season.",10

It almost seems on a par with something you would see on Red Dwarf (a series that parodies Sci Fi).I would have preferred it if more of the main characters were present. There was an odd sense of emptiness where that was concerned. If it were not for that then I would have given this 10/10.The nature of the occurrences were not exactly scientifically believable but it did not really matter to me.

Fortunately, the Captain and Data are not aboard and when they do find the ship is a very sorry state, they set about correcting this problem. This is a mildly entertaining episode. While it was pretty cool seeing the cool primordial makeup on a few crew members, a few things seemed odd. Shouldn't many of the crew members have been eaten by some of the more aggressive changelings? And where is all the manure and territory that the creatures would have 'marked'? In addition, the show never became enthralling...only interesting.By the way, Data the living computer made a mistake in this one!

So it's time to make one so horrible, it will be remembered forever.Except I had forgotten it. My wife remembered bits and pieces, though it was scrambled. She though that Troi would turn into a spider (she didn't; someone else did), so I'm sure we had seen it together. But my subconscious, protecting me, had erased it totally from my memory, but after watching it a second time, said, ""Sorry, Bud. This time you have to live with the memory forever."" So here I am.But it's not the end of the world for me. I actually dozed off in my chair for about 5-7 minutes of the story, and had to ask my wife what had happened.So many STTNG episodes will be with me forever, treasured and watched again.

The first time I saw it, it blew me away to see what each crew member devolved into. Data and the Captain in the darkened ship...very cool. I had goose bumps over the sounds... My only question was why earthlings could be different from one another. A spider and a cave man? Probably should have brought in a few aliens to turn into some different species. And the reviewer wondering why more were not eating/eaten bugged me too...again some aliens could have picked up the slack. But then they kind of explained a bit? All in all, it was exciting, crazy and unlike the hundreds of other episodes of the franchise. Give it a break--such overly critical thinking only restricts imagination and chance- taking. Regarding Paramount's dirty decision to cancel TNG to maximize immediate profit, those persons should be named and blamed for their poor judgment--we fans will pay the price forever, missing more exceptional episodes of one of the best shows ever.

This episode is a departure from anything philosophical or deep that the other episodes provide, and instead is just FUN. I always welcome these episodes to break up the season's tone and just do whatever they want.Sure it's not realistic, sure its got plot holes, but you know what it also has? A well-executed change of atmosphere, well directed build-up, and just a unique, Twilight Zone-esque journey through some space silliness that, at the very least, is a joy to watch the crew indulge in as its last crazy-hurrah of the season.I do not envy anyone who can't voluntarily put aside their elitist fanboy-ism of a serie's tropes and universe and just take something at face value, for they probably don't get much entertainment from much else.",

Meanwhile on the bridge a test of an 'improved' torpedo goes wrong; this leaves Worf furious with himself as he was the one who'd modified it. While Capt.

Early on it was fun seeing Dwight Schultz return as the hypochondriac Lt. Barclay as he suggests various fatal ailments he might have. As the crew start changing things are intriguing as there is no indication were it is going until Worf bites Troi the sprays Beverley with poison! Once Picard and Data get back it is clear that the crew has entirely changed and many of the ship's systems are offline; this leads to a distinctly creepy atmosphere as they here strange noises while walking through darkened corridors.

Unfortunately, the treatment results in a ship wide gene mutation to everyone on board.

His fears of what is happening to his own body get played out by the virus that his own body created. A massive case of subconscious projection ? But amongst all the shenanigans there is a serious story. I always love episodes where the Captain returns to find his ship adrift with some mystery to solve. Voyager does that a few times. Someone else mentioned Red Dwarf. It seems clear they parody this episode with ""Pete"" ( http://reddwarf.wikia.com/wiki/RD:_Pete_I ). The pet bird devolving into a dinosaur ?

0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Journey's End (TV Episode 1994)",One of the dumbest sub-plots ever in TNG,"(KINDA SPOILERY)I loved the main plot about the forced removal of a people. It was about ethics and caused me to think. The writing however could have been better as the solution to the dilemma was so obvious that the story should have treated it as though it was already considered by the Indian.The side story arc with Wes was one of the dumbest, most ad-hoc sub-plots in any TNG episode. Completely random and beyond my suspension of disbelief. It would have been much more interesting if they explored what caused the changes in his personality instead of just using it as a spring board to a big reveal. All in all, the surprise doesn't work and the epilogue had me shaking my head at how nonchalant Beverly and Picard dealt with such a world-altering event.",5

At the same time, a moody Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton in his last Star Trek performance before Star Trek: Nemesis) is on break from Starfleet Academy, alienating everyone onboard the Enterprise.Sensing Wesley's troubled demeanor, a visiting Indian elder invites him to the Native American colony for a vision quest - a quest that will have profound repercussions for Wesley. Picard also has a connection with the Native American settlers too - a relative from his past (23 generations ago).It should be noted that this episode is a precursor to Star Trek: Voyager - more precisely Chakotay's character.Natalia Nogulich returns as Vice Admiral Alynna Nechayev (who has softened a bit here), Doug Wert as Cmdr. Jack R. Crusher (Wesley's late father), and Eric Menyuk as The Traveler. Richard Poe also stars as the Cardassian Gul Evek (in his first of many roles in TNG, DS9, and VOY).",
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Journey's End (TV Episode 1994)",Worst Plot Twist Ever,"This is the first review I've written of ST:TNG and I hate that I am motivated by the worst that this series has to offer.I have been watching the episodes on Netflix, in order, over the past several weeks. Season 7 is the worst season, and episode 20, Journey's End, is the worst of the worst. There are a few other episodes that typically rank near the bottom, but for me this one takes the cake.Why? Because, out of nowhere, Wesley can stop time. And then start it again. With his mind.Yeah, you read that right. It's a completely ridiculous plot point that serves no purpose except to get rid of Wesley, which they could have done any number of ways that wouldn't have involved him stopping and starting time.If zero stars were an option, I would have given this zero stars.",1
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Journey's End (TV Episode 1994)",Stereotypes and Preachiness,"One of the silliest TNG episodes ever, although it tries to make a moral point, it's mired in bad stereotypes. Pre-American natives, referred to as ""Indians"" in the episode, are presented as ridiculous 60s cowboy movie types--something they've been complaining about since the early twentieth century. One of the other reviews suggested this episode was ""ahead of its time,"" but how can it be ahead of its time when it plays the noble savage card--outdated since the 1970s. Wesley is another example of bad stereotyping in the episode. I admit, I've grown to like his character in recent years, but this last visit from him is the absolute worst. First, he's the broody teenager cliché, then he becomes the hippie era white-kid-exploring-non-white-spiritual-culture cliché, and finally, he goes off the deep end with one of the most absurd call-backs to a previous episode ever.",3
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Journey's End (TV Episode 1994)",Wesley leaves!,"This episode is pretty stupid, though it does at least mark the end to Wesley's appearances on the show. While I assume Wil Wheaton is a lovely person in real life, I have met very few people that liked him on the show. Here, oddly, he's at his very, very worst-- insufferable in fact!The Federation has just negotiated a treaty with the Kardashian Empire*. As part of the treaty, some Federation planets will need to be evacuated and some of the Kardashians will have to do the same. This is a real problem for an ultra-bizarro group of American Indians** who are inexplicably living there. After all, I could appreciate their desire to leave Earth since folks weren't particularly nice to them in the past. But why did they need to go to THIS place way across space?! Considering how close it is to Kardashian space, this is just illogical. Speaking of illogical, there is the plot about Wesley. So much of it just doesn't make sense. First, when he comes aboard he is sullen, insufferable and nasty. While this is normal for most teens, he's supposed to be about 20 and in his final year at Starfleet Academy. He was written very poorly because he was so extremely unlikable and behaved like a boorish jerk. Second, one of the Indians** takes him on a long spirit journey to discover who he really is. And, third, this same being then tells Wesley he's ascending to a higher form of life--and in light of what an annoying idiot he's become, there is no way ANYONE could believe this!! Oh, and the one native leader is clearly wearing a long-hair wig, as you can see the seams if you look carefully!*Yes, I know they are Cardassians. My daughter calls them that and I think it's kind of cute.**What do you call these people?! I want to be nice and all politically correct and all, but you CANNOT call them 'Native Americans'. Apart from being a bit patronizing, they certainly aren't Americans since they live on a planet other than Earth. And, since they never mention which tribe they are, you cannot call them by their tribe. Just wondering what to do about this?",2
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Journey's End (TV Episode 1994)",Jar-Jar Wesley,"Wesley has always been somewhat of an Albatross for STNG.Originally a good idea-concept for a character on a Star Trek revival, the writers quickly developed an inconsistency on how to handle him in episode plots. Which quickly doomed the character to fans.Sometimes, he was a prodigy genius that saves the ship, other times a last resort subject for a script concept.Sort of a John-Boy Walton/Will Robinson type, both Lost in Space! The biggest problem I have with this character and the writers that wrote him, is that in the episode ""Journey's End"", Wesley pretty much severs all ties to Star Fleet, and leaves under circumstances that would prevent him from ever being allowed to return to Star Fleet service. Ever.That's assuming that an inter-dimensional, space-time traveling being, who can control warp fields with his mind, would ever want to join Star Fleet again in the first place.But in ST: Nemesis, Wesley is seen back in Star Fleet, again, and joining Riker on his new ship, Titan.I'm so glad the Titan series books never mention him.",5
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Journey's End (TV Episode 1994)",One Story Ends with a Blowout;; Another Begins with a Pinprick,"The most visible occurrence of this episode is the last appearance of the Wesley Crusher character. Paying close attention, we learn that this promising Starfleet whiz kid is inwardly becoming depressed at the prospect of completing his studies and becoming an officer. During a mission to relocate the residents of a Federation colony on Dorvan V which is being ceded to Cardassia, Wesley meets a mysterious Native American who encourages him to take a vision quest, revealing an image from his father Jack Crusher telling Wes not to become an officer. After committing a deliberate violation of Starfleet code of conduct, shedding his uniform and trying to intervene in a violent brawl between the colonists and arriving Cardassians, Wesley discovers the mysterious Indian is none other than The Traveler, an inter-dimensional alien whom the Enterprise crew had encountered seven years earlier, now asking Wesley to travel with him to explore other plains of existence.Though concluding Wesley's arc was important, the more important aspect of this episode is in the story of the attempt to resettle the Federation colonists from Dorvan V. This intended resettlement is the direct result of a border treaty with Cardassia, requiring them and the Federation to exchange colonies across the redrawn border. The Dorvan colonists, having spent generations being relocated in their search for a home, refuse to leave - or to be forcibly removed. The Cardassian newcomers agree to let them live undisturbed under Cardassian jurisdiction, an agreement which is destined to be short lived. In the immediate interim during Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, other colonists will refuse to be evacuated, try cutting ties with the Federation, suffer harassment by Cardassian bullies and band together to form a resistance, the Maquis. The Maquis would then play a vital role during Star Trek Voyager. And, it stems from a pinprick incident from this episode.",8
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Journey's End (TV Episode 1994)",Farewell to Wesley Crusher,As peace is established between the Federation and the Cardassians a border is established; this leaves each side with a handful of colonies on the wrong side of the line. The Enterprise is given the delicate task of relocating a colony of Native Americans; Picard argues that they have been forced to move enough times due to treaties that were forced on them but he is told they must be moved anyway by force if necessary. This mission coincides with a visit to the Enterprise by Wesley Crusher; he manages to offend people with his surly attitude and it turns out his grades at Star Fleet Academy have fallen to a point where we could fail. One of the Native Americans approaches him and tells him he has been expected; he is a little confused but agrees to go down to the planet and undertake a vision quest. During this he sees his late father and is told that he should take his own path. Shortly afterwards he alerts the locals to the fact that they are about to be forcibly relocated; something that incurs the wrath of Capt. Picard.This episode was a little disappointing; Wesley Crusher was always a bit too perfect and here we learn that he is in fact some sort of super-being with powers to control time! Wil Wheaton's performance is solid enough but can't save the character when we get such a revelation. We also get the revelation that one of Picard's ancestors was part of a Spanish force that massacred members of Pueblo Indians several centuries ago and those on the planet think this is an ancient wrong that needs righting it seemed surprising that this would be known so long after the event. The ultimate solution to the problem of the colonists seemed a little obvious; it is amazing that nobody suggested it sooner; they are just one small village on an entire planet; hardly the obstacle they were portrayed as. Overall a rather weak episode.,6
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Journey's End (TV Episode 1994)",Trek always ahead of its time.,"Besides the hints at ""Voyager"" and ""Insurrectiuon"", take note of Picard's ancestor; Spanish Conquistador Yavier Piccard.

For fans of the ""Badlands"" Trek novels, Gul Evek's crossover from ""Next Gen"" to ""Voy"" (and later demise) is explained from this episode. Also the DS9 novels tie in these events to the ones in Season 7's ""Pre-emptive Strike""; where Ro meets Chakotay before his Maquis crew encounters the Caretaker. Many have speculated that when Wesley is seen again in ""Nemesis"" he was an unofficial Federation liaison to the Traveler's race, or even be part of Riker's USS Titan adventures. Stay tuned.",
9,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Journey's End (TV Episode 1994)",Spoiled White Twenty Something to Lead Native American Culture,"By this time in the series, the pensive Wesley Crusher has become a non-player. All his successes as a Wunderkind were intriguing, mostly because of his baby face and Gee-wiz excitement over having so much power. This is a simplistic story of a group of Indian colonists who are about to be removed from their planet after treaty in the Federation. Wow, what a coincidence. This is not to diminish the plight of Native Americans; it's just the ridiculous contrivances of this. These people are resisting the treaty and are about to be put out on some remote planet (perhaps the planet of northern Oklahoma) without their permission. They are willing to take the chance of sitting in the middle of the Kardassian empire, but Picard has been given the job (against his wishes) of resettling. All that is enough to make this a weak episode, but for some reason, the recalcitrant version of Wesley Crusher, beset with ennui, has been chosen as their spiritual leader. He has been picked by the tribal master to go on a vision quest. Anyway, it really doesn't wash.",5

This is Wil Wheaton's farewell performance in the role for the television series.Captain Picard has a delicate situation. Several generations ago an American Indian tribe moved to a planet to preserve their culture and identity. But that planet became part of the Cardassian-Federation dispute and war. Now it is part of the treaty which assigns it to Cardassian jurisdiction. It is suggested that they move but they've got an understandable fear of treaties.How Wil Wheaton figures in all of this is for you to watch and see how it unfolds. But in the end he makes a life altering decision.This episode belongs to him and to Gates McFadden. The scenes with mother and son are really touching.My disappointment is that this seemed like the premise of another TV series with Wesley Crusher. It's obvious someone had this mind at least at some point. It should have been made so.One of my favorite TNG episodes. A must for Trekkies everywhere.",9
13,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Journey's End (TV Episode 1994)","The premise was passble, but...","Using the episode as a way to knock Wesley Crusher off his ""high horse"" was a BAD idea. I dislike the fact that Wesley had so much potential, his genius and the great encounters with the Traveler should have been explored, that's the way a storyline should have been taken.
Instead they cook up this plot line with a group of American Indians. (And why this need to portray American Indians on a planet thousands of light years away? The pulled that kind of trick in the original Star Trek. It didn't work that well either.) And really, would a pale face be looked upon as some sort of messiah?
This is another example of the way that TNG was veered off into societal topics, becoming too preachy and full of thinly veiled PC topics. When Roddenberry passed away, the ones who went forward with the writing really butchered what had made seasons 3, 4, and 5 such a hit. Considering all the flops that season 7 had, the series should ended with season 6.",4
14,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Journey's End (TV Episode 1994)",An excellent story marred by what else but...Wesley Crusher's character,"This is a good episode with a powerful story and moral dilemma concerning the relocation of a group of American Indians - could have been a 9 or a 10 with a little more drama and if not for the terrible inconsistencies and the problematic character of Wesley Crusher.Wesley had SO much potential in TNG, his genius and his encounters with the Traveler could have been exploited so much better, but unfortunately it wasn't always the case. This is one of the episodes where his side story ruins the otherwise excellent base premise. Apart from his annoying baby face stupid smile that's part of his ""acting"" in TNG every 2 minutes or so, there is absolutely no way any group of American Indians would have considered Wesley some sort of Messiah or treat him as one of their own, for a couple of simple reasons: he's too young, he's disobedient, he has no spiritual depth whatsoever and ... he disrespects elders, especially after joining the Academy. All these Wesley traits make him totally incompatible with a culture like the American Indian one, period.Other than that, the premise of this episode could have produced an effect relatively close to that of 'Inner Light', if exploited properly (maybe some tragic outcome of the main plot) - it certainly suited the culture's history. It wasn't to be however, and the Indians' and Wesley's stories were blended in a very unrealistic fashion. Picard or even Worf could have been much more suited for Wesley's act, while Wesley's subplot could have been merged into another, more suitable episode. In the end, it all looks forced and not that believable (to say the least), pretty much like trying to eat soup and cake together.",7
15,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Journey's End (TV Episode 1994)",Disappointed,"I love Star Trek:TNG, but I was disappointed about this episode and the way Wesley Crusher exited the show. I didn't mind the character growing and leaving starfleet but I don't like the portrayal of it in that episode. The character was conflicted, I get that, but I wasn't happy with the rudeness displayed and him leaving without reconciling or saying goodbye to certain members of the crew that he was close to.

Hoping to help Worf, Picard directs the Enterprise to stop at Maranga IV where Worf and Alexander attend the festival of Kot'baval. There, a mysterious family friend, K'mtar, is there to help and offers to train Alexander to become a warrior.But, there's something about K'mtar that isn't right . . . and at the same time, VERY familiar. And perhaps K'mtar can help bring the conflict between father and son to an end.Trivia note: Brian Bonsall returns in his first appearance as Alexander Rozhenko since 1992's ""A Fistful Of Datas"" and with this episode concludes his story arc on TNG.

1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Firstborn (TV Episode 1994)",A very good episode,"It seems that most people who review the episode are put off by it. I thought it was a very good episode that brought Worf and his son closer together and showed what kind of future it might hold for both of them.When Alexander is hesitant about becoming a warrior, his father takes him to see a Klingon festival, so as to convince him that his culture is rich. They end up being attacked, and a stranger saves them. He is from the same house as Worf and tries to explain to young Alex that he needs to be able to fight to protect himself and those he cares about.I felt that the entire episode showed how Klingons can be rough and be a warrior race, and yet manage to be kind and affectionate when appropriate. *spoiler*They thing that seems to be off-putting for the reviewers is the fact that the stranger that appeared in this episode is Alex from the future. The reason is because Alex decides to grow up not being a warrior, but wanting peace between the households. As a result, Worf dies in his arms in roughly 30 years from now. He wants to force himself to be less foolish and to become a warrior so that his father doesn't die. Worf ends up saying that he is proud of Alex, saying that peace is a worthwhile goal and that now he has come to the future who knows how Worf will die.The reason for Alex going to the future is a bit, well, not existent. Just that he met a man in some sector that could help. Worf did believe him a little quick, but it wasn't completely unreasonable, I've heard worse excuses from ST:TNG.PS: I also enjoyed someone *else* time traveling and *we* have to take their acts on faith; too many times has someone gone to the future/past and had to explain themselves to the poor people of that episode, it was fun to see the exact opposite happening.*end spoiler*While the execution and development of certain aspects of the episode were somewhat poor, the story was entertaining and something I was very glad to see, especially in the last (and perhaps poorest) season of the show.",9
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Firstborn (TV Episode 1994)",One of the weaker Worf episodes.,"I was not thrilled by this episode--and this might be because I am a huge fan of Worf and so I tend to expect more from these shows. I almost always love episodes that focus on him (after all, what other member of the crew murdered someone in revenge and got away with it?!) but this one has a few problems--most likely the crazy twist at the end.The show begins with Worf at wits end because Alexander is not a demented maniacal warrior like a good Klingon should be. When Picard hears about it, he recommends that Worf take his son to a nearby planet for a Klingon holiday celebration. Once there, Worf is nearly killed and he is saved by a family friend (sort of like Robert Duvall's relationship to the Corleone family). This guy sees Worf is upset about Alexander and tries to help the boy rise above common sense and cling to his berserker-like Klingon roots.This isn't a bad episode...just the ending. See it...see what this dopey twist is and how quickly Worf just accepts this!",5
3,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Firstborn (TV Episode 1994)",Sort of Interesting Klingon Stuff,"Worf seems to never have made a commitment to his role as security officer. He has exhibited great distress over his connection to his son, who looks totally Klington but is pretty much basking in his white genes. He is a resistant little guy and Worf has designs for him to be a warrior. As the episode moves along, Alexander begins to become enthralled with Klingon stuff, but when push comes to shove, he moves back to his less aggressive self. This whole warrior thing and dying with honor seems sort of archaic, almost mythological in scope. A stranger enters the lives of the two and begins to bang the drum for Alexander to embrace his Klingon being, even suggesting that he go to a Klingon prep school (I wonder if they wear blazers). There is much more to this, however, and it ends on an interesting note. We also get to see the tussle between Worf's warrior side and the tender side of his role as father.",7
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Firstborn (TV Episode 1994)",Worf's son does not want to become a warrior,"Worf is concerned when his son Alexander tells him he does not wish to take part in the Klingon Rite of Ascension; something that must be done before he is thirteen if he is to become a Klingon warrior; as the Enterprise isn't doing anything urgent Capt. Picard suggests going to a nearby Klingon outpost where a festival is taking place. While there Worf is attacked by a group of Klingons but another warrior comes to his aid. This warrior is K'Mtar; a distant cousin, who offers to help guide Alexander. A weapon dropped by one of the attackers links them to the Duras family; the hunt to find them will require a chat to Deep Space Nine's Quark and a clever ploy against a group of ore smugglers. Once the Duras Sisters are finally found the protest their innocence and suspicion falls closer to home.Worf is a fine character but episodes that concentrate on the relationship between him and his son tend to be disappointing; and this one is no exception. It isn't that there is anything wrong with the acting; Alexander is just a bit of a tedious character and I just couldn't bring myself to care whether he becomes a warrior or not. On the plus side K'Mtar was a decent character and there was quite a twist regarding his identity at the end. It was also nice to have a cameo from Armin Shimerman as Quark and the Duras Sisters are always entertaining. Overall a comparatively weak episode with no real sense of excitement.",6

DaiMon Bok (from the 1st season episode ""The Battle"", this time played by Lee Arenberg instead of Frank Corsentino), seeks to avenge his son because he thinks Picard killed him while he was captain of the Stargazer. In ""The Battle"", he gave Picard the Stargazer back as a ""gift"" but at the same time used a mind probe to make him relive the incident and ruin his life. With that plan averted, DaiMon Bok lost his rank.Now, he's back and a DaiMon again - to avenge his son, he will now kill Picard's son (which comes as a surprise to Picard since he never knew he had a son!) - his name is Jason Vigo. Picard feels he has a responsibility to protect him against Bok and goes to his rescue on Camor IV before it's too late.But, is Jason really Picard's son?",

In this one, Picard, who was forced to blow up a Ferengi vessel in an earlier episode, is confronted by the Ferengi whose son was on board that ship. He has sworn revenge and tells Picard that he has a son, unknown to him, and the D'Aimon is going to execute him. Picard finds the ""son"" and brings him aboard the Enterprise to protect him. Apparently, the Captain had had some dalliance in the past and this young rebellious guy was the result. Unfortunately, the Ferengi leader seems to have access to the ship and is set upon making PIcard pay. The episode involves Picard getting to know this young man and do what is right. Once again, there is a kind of pall over the episode and it just doesn't work that well.",7

Well, the fun-loving DaiMon Bok is back--and this time he pledges to kill Picard's son...though as far as Picard knows he doesn't have one! So, the Captain thinks back and realizes that one woman might have given him a son many, many years ago. What follows is a strange little episode, as Picard tries to make up for lost time with a rather irresponsible and strange young man. And, of course, he tries to stop Bok before he can do very bad things.All in all, this is a decent but forgettable episode. It's mildly interesting to see the Captain think about what his life could have been like and the ending didn't seem all that surprising. Worth seeing but nothing more.",7

It's a Ferengi Daemon played by Larry Arenberg who says he's going to kill a son that Picard never knew he had. That's in revenge for Picard killing a son of his in battle years ago.Said son turns out to be Ken Olandt, son of a woman that Picard had been involved with in his younger days. Olandt is 24 now and a bit of a scapegrace. Nevertheless he's happy that he has a father now as is Patrick Stewart.However there's still the vengeful Ferengi to be dealt with and he's developed some kind of long range transportation system that has bedeviled the Enterprise crew. In the end all the truths are revealed about Picard, about Arenberg, and about Olandt. Dr. Crusher has a big part in finding those truths.Ken Olandt is engaging and likable in this story, the kind of son you would Jean-Luc Picard would have. Olandt and Stewart have some good scenes together. Also for once we have a Ferengi motivated by something more than riches.",6
4,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Bloodlines (TV Episode 1994)",Is Picard a father?,"Picard is in for quite a surprise when the Enterprise discovers a Ferengi probe which delivers a message from DaiMon Bok; he blames Picard for the death of his son fifteen years previously and he promises to kill Picard's son in revenge a son Picard wasn't aware that he had! After some research Picard learns that a woman he had a brief relationship with over twenty years ago had a child not too long after he last saw her. The Enterprise manages to find the boy, who is now twenty three, and a DNA analysis quickly establishes that he is indeed Picard's son. The boy, Jason Vigo, doesn't seem interested in getting to know his father but the captain tries to get closer to him, even after learning of Jason's criminal past. Even though Jason is on the Enterprise Bok manages to kidnap him; if Picard is to save him he will have to teleport to Bok's ship alone.This is a decent enough episode, certainly better than the previous couple of episodes. The opening immediately grabs the viewers' attention as there had been no previous mention of Picard's son not surprising given that he was unaware of him. Bok is a decent antagonist although the idea that he could beam on and off the Enterprise seems a bit unlikely; one would think the Enterprise would have better security. Ken Olandt does a decent enough job as Jason and Lee Arenberg is fun as Bok but it is Patrick Stewart who impresses the most as Picard comes to terms with the news that he has a son and that he is about to be killed. The twist in the ending was reasonable but not really necessary. Overall not a bad episode but ultimately fairly forgettable.",7

This leads to a hodgepodge of stuff going on on the holodeck. There are a group of characters that seem to be part of a dream the ship is having. Whatever is going on appears to be a metaphor for correcting the problem. The ship isn't a true adversary; it is trying to find its way. Data and the gang must figure out what is going on. There is a kind of display that keeps repeating itself all around the ship that may be the clue to its intentions. As is often the case, things make sense to everyone but the audience.

How this ever got from paper to screen is beyond me. Such a shame to see Ronald D. Moore's hallowed name in there too! The script has no real redeeming qualities either.

The show is a holodeck episode and I should point out that that I almost always hate episodes that take place in the holodeck--which is exactly why I disliked it. It seems that something in the computer system is showing signs of sentience and it's centered on one of the holodecks. When the crew enters to see what's happening, they see various disparate characters from various programs on a train. Using metaphors as a guide, the crew decide to help the conductor get the train to where it's going--as otherwise the ship will continue behaving very unpredictably.It's a holo episode. If you like 'em, you'll probably like this. If you think they show evidence of poor writing, then you won't. I didn't.",3
6,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Emergence (TV Episode 1994)",The ship gains an intelligence which manifests itself in the holodeck,"As this episodes opens something goes wrong in the holodeck; a train almost hits Picard and Data as the latter works through a scene from The Tempest. It turns out the train was from another 'Orient Express' program. It is initially assumed that it is just a fault on the holodeck but it becomes obvious that something else is wrong when the Enterprise suddenly goes into warp. Nobody gave the order but the action saved the ship. Investigations lead to the discovery of an emergent intelligence in the ship's computer. The holodeck appears to be the centre of this occurrence so much of the investigation takes place there. The program running combines elements of several other programs with various characters aboard a train representing ships functions. With many systems, including life support, offline the crew will have to help get the train to its destination if they are to save the ship and its crew.Holodeck episodes are usually weaker than average and this one was no exception in fact it was weak even when compared to other holodeck episodes. Having various parts of the holodeck program representing parts of the ship's emerging intelligence wasn't too subtle so the characters came across as walking clichés the story would probably have been more interesting we didn't have the metaphorical mumbo-jumbo on the holodeck and instead just had the crew on the Enterprise, outside the holodecks, working to find a solution. Overall I'd say this episode is a bit of a mess and quite a disappointment.",5
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Emergence (TV Episode 1994)",Railfans opinion of this TNG episode,"Good episode, I liked it however who ever wrote the script knows nothing about trains....in certain parts of the episode when they show the locomotive, the cab is totally wrong for a steam locomotive. #2 there is NO way from the passenger cars to the cab of a steam locomotive safely. you would have to climb up over the tender and no railroad company would let passengers do that. there is a reference to the train being on the wrong track, #1 that is almost impossible because the track would be preset. also there is a reference to to the train ""running out of steam"" at 32:40...a steam locomotive does not just lose power like that, it would take a while for the steam pressure to go down..probably the biggest thing I did not like was that I saw no one in the cab actually running the locomotive...a steam locomotive is a very sensitive locomotive that needs constant attention to run. if not and steam pressure builds to high the boiler will explode.another thing I do not like is that conductor ...adding being a Railfan, these little mistakes were annoying but still like this episode one other thing that is kinda weird is that cab of the locomotive is called a engine room. never heard anyone call the cab that",5
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Emergence (TV Episode 1994)",An interesting way to retell a rehashed plot,As we approach the final episodes of season seven it is obvious that the writers are having a difficult time bring new plots into the scripts. In this offering we have another story of a developing life form. But the writers reach deep down on this story and the new life form is the Enterprise itself.It all begins on the holodeck when a program malfunctions and begins running more than one program. Then the Enterprise begins operating on its on accord as if the ship is thinking for itself. And as with all these types of programs it will be up to the crew to help with a possible emerging life form.This was a rehashed story that has been used many times in the series. But what saved this show from becoming another repeat plot was the way the episode used the holodeck program characters to tie the story together with the main plot. It was a new way to bring an old story-line to life. As we approach the end of the series this episode proved that you can do new things with old plots. Which should have been used on many of the episodes in weak season seven.,7

0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Preemptive Strike (TV Episode 1994)",This episode is a gem among stones.,"With lackluster shows in this final season, this episode proved to be a gem among the stones as this was an interesting tale with entertaining results. It begins as Ro Laren (Michelle Forbes) returns to the cast after graduating from Starfleet and returning to the Enterprise crew. She was able to return to Starfleet thanks to Captain Picard's recommendation and she wants to repay the Captain for the kindness shown. But the task that she will be assigned with prove difficult for her.Due to problems with a group of rebels called the Maquis that are attacking Cardassain's ships, the peace treaty between the Cardassains and Starfleet could be in jeopardy. Ro will be assigned to infiltrate the rebel group and report where and when the Maquis plan to attack so that the Enterprise can put an end to this rebel group. However, Ro begins to have feeling for the rebel group and those feeling could risk her position with Starfleet and her loyalty and gratitude toward Captain Picard.This is an entertaining story that returned the series to the roots of personal conflict within the plot. This season has been sugary stories that tend to rely more on writing so that each main character gets face time rather than developing a good story. This episode went back to getting an interesting plot and develop the situation around the story. A nice show indeed!",9
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Preemptive Strike (TV Episode 1994)",All the wrong notes,"""Preemptive Strike"" is a rushed episode which features the return, and departure, of Ensign Ro Laren. Ro returns to the Enterprise after a lengthy absence while she received special training. She is greeted warmly by Picard, who then immediately assigns here to an undercover assignment to infiltrate the Maquis. The Maquis are engaged with a gorilla war against the Cardassians. The members of the Maquis who she meets provoke ambivalent emotions in Ro, which ultimately leads her to betray Picard and defect to the Maquis.While the acting, dialogue and production values are good to great, the episode feels like a misstep. Picard's genuine feelings of affection for Ro are overridden by his desire for her to complete the covert operation. The operation itself is questionable. I would expect Picard to raise many more questions than he does; in fact, he seems quite eager to be a 24th century CIA operative. He makes Ro into a tool to be used. If that was the goal, then the producers succeeded. The exception to the episode's failure is Ro's relationship to the elder Maquis leader, who symbolically takes Picard's place in Ro's life before his death. Again, if that was the goal, then it could be called a success. I call it a sellout, forcing Picard to behave in a manner totally inconsistent with what we know about him. Not recommended.",4

These are Federation renegades who are unhappy with the developments in the movement outward in the galaxy. There are too many treaties with rival alien worlds, particularly the Cardassians. The Enterprise has been given the task of infiltrating this group which has the Bejoran culture at its center. Ensign Ro Laren has been given the task of spying on this group. She is willing to take this on because Picard rescued her from a spiral into oblivion. What happens, however, is that while she is secretly a part of the Maquis, she begins to understand their unhappiness and their oppression by forces beyond their control. They are guerrilla fighters in a kind of intergalactic brush war. She is embraced by them and becomes the darling of their old leader who has great affection for her and her ""cause."" What starts out as a mission becomes a kind of betrayal. It shows how things are not so simple when you see the actual face of the enemy. Quite well done.",8

After learning more about the Maquis, she grows more sympathetic with their cause. And due to this conflict of loyalties, Ro Laren is torn . . . but must soon make a choice.Trivia note: Deep Space Nine is mentioned here.",

The plot, the writing, the politics, the performances, especially that of the beautiful Ms. Michelle Forbes. Can we really call Lieutenant Ro a traitor? The reason this episode is so great is because we become just as torn as Lt. Ro? While ultimately our allegiances may lie with Starfleet, in the end we understand why she did what she did. I love the radical character that is Lt. Ro. She is committed to justice for her people ""by any means necessary"" (in the words of the great El-hajj Malik Shabazz). At the end of the episode we see Captain Picard, perplexed in the extreme, nearly in a state of shock. I can only imagine he is hurt, furious, disappointed. Perhaps some part of him feels like a fool. But what he will wrestle with the most is the part of himself that understands why she did what she did, the part of himself that recognizes that she is who she is, maybe even some part of himself that knew that this was a possible outcome.",10
5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Preemptive Strike (TV Episode 1994)",Ro goes undercover with the Maquis,This episode sees the return of recently promoted Lt Ro Laren after time away on the Advanced Tactical Training course; she doesn't get time to settle back into life on the Enterprise though as she is soon sent on a dangerous undercover mission. After the peace between the Federation and the Cardassians some of those who have found their home worlds are now in Cardassian territory are fighting against what they see as their new oppressors. These are the Maquis and it is Lt Ro's job to infiltrate the group and lure them into an ambush so they can be captured by the Federation. They are initially suspicious of Ro but when she helps them steal a large quantity of medical supplies from the Enterprise they grow to trust her. As she gets to know them she starts to symaphise with their cause; she tries to get Capt Picard to call off the mission but he refuses and tells her that if she fails to continue with the mission as planned she will be in serious trouble for disobeying orders; ultimately Ro must decide whether to follow orders or do what she believes is right.There have been rather too many poorer than average episodes this season but this isn't one of them. When Ro Laren was introduced she quickly became one of my favourite characters so I was rather disappointed that she quickly disappeared from the show with now real explanation this tells us why she was away and gives her one of her best stories; she is definitely the main character and the excellent Michelle Forbes has no difficulty carrying the episode. Too often in Star Trek the issues are very black and white and the Federation are always the good guys but here things are less certain; the peace with the Cardassians is clearly a good thing overall but those now on the wrong side of the border find themselves bullied by an oppressive regime so it is understandable that they will fight back. This provides a real dilemma for Ro and for once one can see Picard might be on the wrong side of the argument. As the episode progresses it is far from obvious how the story will end but as Ro gets closer to the Maquis the possibility that she won't help the Federation capture them rises distinctly. Overall a really good episode with some moral ambiguity and some decent action.,9

But what happens is that she starts a realization of her Bajoran roots when she meets up with the Maquis cell. Most especially with the head of said cell John Franklyn- Robbins with whom she develops an almost father/daughter relationship.Captain Picard has considered Ro his own protégé and Michelle Forbes's scenes with Picard as well as Macias the Maquis leader have a lot of poignancy.In the end, in her last appearance on TNG as Ro Laren Michelle Forbes gave a real good performance.

At the time, it appeared as if she was going to become a regular on the show but after only a few appearances she disappeared until this penultimate episode. It begins with the Maquis suddenly gaining an advantage over the Cardassians in their guerilla war. Since the members of this rogue organization are mostly made up of people living within the Federation, it's up to the Enterprise to try to bring their terrorist ways under control and bring these rebels to justice. To do so, Picard asks Ro to go undercover--a thoroughly stupid idea, as she obviously is very much in sympathy with these folks. Can she serve the Federation or will her natural inclination to hate Cardassians and kick butt propel her towards becoming a traitor to Starfleet?This is a decent enough episode and it's well done.

Commander Data, who means nothing but business, unfortunately, is the guy that means the least amount of business, often relied upon for the humor, he might be explored thoroughly but is rarely projected with sincerity.Personally, I prefer Stewart's mellow equation with Wheaten who looks up to him as a father figure and adds the right amount of emotion to it, McFadden's friendly relation too helps on spicing up this dish. The guest cast coming in- often playing the antagonist- invests equally and perpetually to this scoreboard. Advancing further than the previous series did, this journey also brings in rich traditional rituals and their own quirky references to the table. Star Trek: The Next Generation is your typical space ride, floating without any control it grabs everything like a child, and in its innocence and honesty it is one breathtaking ride.Season 07The seventh act of the series seemed like an overstretched material where the writers were clearly running out of ideas, although to balance it properly, there are few brilliant concepts that defines the ingenious of Star Trek.Preemptive StrikeIt builds up a character to be indestructible and then he breaks in by putting it in an ethical dilemma that makes her think twice, a good comeback by the series although some might complain that we would like to see more of the familiar faces.",
0,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" All Good Things... (TV Episode 1994)",One of the best final episodes for a TV series,"Your reading this for one of possibly two reasons:A) You want to know how others feel about this final episode that you've also seen or,..B) You have no idea about Star TrekGiven the popularity of this series, I'll assume ""A"" is your reason. However, if your the rare ""B"" person, then I recommend avoiding this episode until you've watched at least a few episodes of The Next Generation.This wonderful 2-hour finale utilizes the history of these characters and plots beautifully and with reverence. The lead character of the series, Jean Luc Picard, finds that he is inexplicably shifting between 3 time periods within his own liftime (past, present and future). Once he finds the reason for this, things become more complex and intriguing. His eyes are opened to an even greater threat than what he had perceived to be his own. As wonderful a premise that is, the subplots greatly enhance the characters and draw you into the story.For example, Tasha Yar, a well regarded character in the series was killed early in the shows run. In his shift into the past, Picard once again sees her alive, accompanying him to the Enterprise for the first time (again, ironically). Once he returns to the present, he laments over having seen her again. A beautifully played little scene.The main story combined with these subplots makes for one of the best written series endings ever in TV history.Let's hope that future TV series (not necessarily Trek, of course) have the opportunity to do the same.",
1,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" All Good Things... (TV Episode 1994)",Thank you Captain Jean-Luc Picard,"Ten years ago (i was 21 years old), studying an university exam (Diritto Pubblico), i started to watch Star Trek The Next Generation. It was a great daily meeting for me and my school-mate Loris and i still remember my delusion when we missed the second part of the ""attack of Borg"" cause the local Italian television transmitted it on Saturday. After 10 years i have just finished the vision of ""All Good Things"" and i must say i am tearing for commotion. I bought the 7 DVD-series of STTNG (i received some of them as a present too) last year and now, after one year, i saw all the movies. I have no words: WONDERFUL. I have the first three DVD series of Deep Space Nine ready, but i am certain that in the present, in the past and in the future, my only captain will be Jean-Luc Picard. (sorry for my English)",10
2,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" All Good Things... (TV Episode 1994)",Going out with a bang,"Caution: Spoilers Ahead!!!Like most fans of TNG I am sad to view the final episode, but happy to see that it is one of the strongest.  It is right along with ""the best of both worlds"" and ""cause and effect"" as the three best TNG episodes and I consider this the pinnacle of the series.  To be honest, it viewed more like a movie than a TV show and I love how they made it double length without splitting it over two different episodes.This final chapter was superbly written, directed, and acted.  I thought the love interest with Worf and Troy, although surprising, did not seem too forced and Riker's handling of it was exactly in character.  It was also great for the show to remain consistent whenever it deals with the past, sporting the old uniforms and bringing back some old faces.  In my personal opinion, this is one of the major strengths in the whole star trek series: the progression of uniforms, ship styles and everything is continually linked to a time period and is accurately referenced whenever an episode needs to deal with the past.  I also really enjoyed the ending, with Picard finally sitting down for a poker game with the rest of the crew; his concluding line ""I should have done this earlier"" is a perfect last-line for the series.Lastly, like all Star Trek episodes when they are at their best, this show made me think.  The paradoxial nature of time and time travel is really interesting to contemplate; it reminds us that any of our actions, not matter how insignificant, can have profound effects.  And I love how Q mentions that it is in the study of these paradoxes that science should continue, not in mapping star systems or other trivial things.
All in all this episode is a 10/10.  The added appeal of being able to see what all the crew could have looked like in 25 years was a great extra touch too.  A tremendous ending to a tremendous series, I am sad that TNG is over. But of course (I have to say it:) ""all good things must come to an end.""",10

5,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" All Good Things... (TV Episode 1994)",TV as good as it gets,"There is only two logical places to comment on TNG series and this is one of them. I've been watching the DVD Year sets of TNG and its great to see the show again, without commercials! I remember when I watched this last episode. Seeing it again recently, I thought then and now that it was one show that could've gone on much longer. Except for some of the Enterprise episodes, Star Trek hasn't been as good since, and its really too bad that this crew will not likely make another movie after the underrated Nemesis.TNG had some really good performances, both by the regular cast and guests. Some actors worked for scale wages just to be a little part of the Star Trek experience. Although all of the cast were great, the standouts have to be Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner. It is amazing that neither one garnered awards or even nominations for their work on this show. Their acting elevated the some of the scripts to another level.True fans won't be able to resist having this show at their fingertips and this last show ""All Good Things..."" is reason enough to get Season 7. I'm on Season 4 and enjoying all the episodes again on my way to it...",8

I'll admit, as many have already noted, that there are technical flaws in the storyline, but that doesn't take away from the best finale I've ever seen.Character development has evolved so much within the series, it is fantastic that the finale revolves around Picard, his crew and foes unique to STNG. I, for one, enjoyed seeing how the writers projected these characters beyond anything they had presented in any of the previous episodes.So, if you enjoy the series, and are looking for an all encapsulating episode that contains action, thought, character relationships and a little Trek history, this is definitely the episode for you. Without spoiling this story, I felt the final scene was the best way to send this show into it's TV conclusion.",10
7,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" All Good Things... (TV Episode 1994)",The Greatest Star Trek Episode of All Time,"""All Good Things"" easily surpassed many of the Star Trek movies in its politically intricate and emotionally charged plot. It is a tradegy that ST:TNG had to come to an end at the crest of its success since two of the three movies ""Generations"" and ""Insurrection"" didn't come close to keeping the glory and concept of Star Trek Alive. ""All Good Things"" will go down in the Star Trek and Sci-Fi grapevine as the most watched and defining show of its time. Kudos.",9
8,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" All Good Things... (TV Episode 1994)",The best example of Star Trek; better than all the movies.,"Rating: **** out of ****While the original crew had it better with the movies, The Next Generation was the only Star Trek TV series that I watched consistently. The show had a cast that at least equalled that of the original, boasted better production values, and plots that were intriguing and touched on varieties of concepts that Kirk, Spock, and Bones never got the chance to explore. Deep Space Nine was too mired into the whole ""war of the quadrants"" to explore any ideas with real satisfaction, and while Voyager had the best effects and the best premise, the cast was middling at best. Enterprise took a while to get going but had a superb third season and a solid fourth. All Good Things..., the swan song episode for TNG, is possibly the best of Star Trek, period, focusing on mind-boggling concepts while retaining the character development and human interest that made the show so appealing. It's the seventh year that the crew of the Starhip Enterprise have been together, but Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) is experiencing odd timeshifts. He's constantly switching between three different time periods; in the past, right before the Farpoint mission, in the present, and in the future, where the crew has long split up, Picard is retired and is diagnosed with a debilitating mental illness. Naturally, the rest of the crew is skeptical (be it in any time period), but when Picard discovers the true nature of his constant shifting, he realizes it is both the means and cause with which the existence of mankind could be erased.I hesitate to give too much away, though I doubt anyone with a passing interest in Star Trek hasn't already seen this episode. But it plays as an interesting comparison and contrast to the series' first episode, Encounter at Farpoint, which it directly ties in to with Picard's timeshifting to the past. There's been a notable improvement in the quality of the sets and the visual effects, and also the acting, the pacing, and the plot development.All Good Things... has all the solid acting one expects from the cast, and a human touch that was missing from the latest film, Nemesis. It's interesting to note that this episode (meaning the whole series, as well) ends with the door open for all sorts of possibilities; at this time, this clearly implied the much-hyped transition to the big screen.Unfortunately, some of the more open-ended questions this episode focused on were never even touched on. Sure, the Worf/Troi/Riker triangle was resolved, but one of my favorite ongoing side stories, the burgeoning romance between Picard and Dr. Crusher, was completely ignored in the movies. And the final scenes lead one to believe that the movies would take us to ""places"" never explored, even though the most recent film was merely a plot less action movie that didn't even have enough action to warrant the movie's existence.Stewart is the true highlight of this episode, displaying the great acting chops he's been known for. The fact that we care for him and the rest of the crew as well, adds a sense of urgency and involvement in the proceedings that the otherwise quite frantic pace alone might not have been able to develop. The plot twists are pure Trek, each mysterious element giving away to some big revelation that only leads to more questions. The story is engrossing, the dialogue is strong, and the performances and characterizations are spot-on.There are a few problems with All Good Things. The timeshifting obviously means we're going to see past and future versions of the cast, but everyone's aged to a certain extent where they can't quite pass for their more youthful selves and the old-age makeup is never entirely convincing (Old Riker's first appearance gave me a good laugh). That said, I would like to make mention of what full-blown hotties Marina Sirtis and especially Gates McFadden became (McFadden is easily the most attractive post 50-year old actress I've ever seen).The continuing movie series actually began quite well; Generations and First Contact were enjoyable adventures, but everything seemed to fall apart with Insurrection. Funny, All Good Things... is a title that turned out more self-prophetic than anyone would have guessed.",

It finished neatly with the Captain joining into a card game, something he had never done in any other episode, and of course, the Enterprise D sails off into the 'sunset'.In a way, you sort of wish that the final episode said goodbye to TNG as it appears Voyager has done. However, I do appricate the later films in their quality and they just pick up the life of the crew of the Enterprise.May Star Trek live long and prosper.",9

This is a great homage to the fans -- answering the question all fans have whenever any series ends, ""What happened to them?"" Great makeup for every one, especially Doctor Crusher and Whorf as they age!Second, it not only shows in detail what happened to them 25 years after the series ends, this episode also integrates that future into the story! Not only that, as we find out, it's a vital key in the puzzle of the entire episode! Kudos to the genius plotters and writers of it! It's a fanatic fan's dream come true! Third, the pacing, editing and development are so well done -- the pace gradually increases over the two hour length until the final denouement. The whole mystery shifting between three time periods. You can't take your eyes away! Wow! So well done!Fourth, it recycles all the characters from the series, from the beginning to the end. Sadly, Whoopi Goldberg is conspicuous by her absence. But we get Colm Meaney, Denise Crosby, and the great ""Q"" himself: John de Lancie!Fifth, the 'injoke' nature of the trial-- ""We've watched you for seven years,"" and ""Your trek has ended."" These are great references to the series itself. But even if you didn't watch the seven years, and this is your first introduction to 'Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" the trial is a winner! Sixth, the focus of the episode is the amazing acting of Patrick Stewart, here being showcased as three differently aged Captain Jean-Luc Picards. Watching him, you know which of the three time periods he's in. He's fantastic as the old Picard, and of course, all the others!Seventh, the meaning of the episode. When the aged Q touches noses with the aged Picard talking about how the beginning (of your life) shapes the future, that's the truth! Eighth, John de Lancie with Q's great delivery of lines like ""You obtuse piece of flotsam!"" and that mankind came from the proto-soup he calls ""goo,"" which he pronounces ""goo -- ooo.""I've watched this episode half a dozen times, and even read the novelization, but I still keep forgetting what causes the anomaly.

It brings all who were necessary back into the fold for one last (tv) time. Patrick Stewart is at his very best in past, present and future. Having Q in this and his involvement with the story is perfect. Brings the series seven seasons to a full circle. The entire cast is at an all time best in this as a matter of speaking. Seeing other regulars like Tomalak, Admiral Nakamura, O'Brien and Tasha was really heartwarming. The danger in all three time periods was a good story and a brilliant riddle for Picard, who the story is really about, to figure out. The sense of family and friendship, not seen in Voyager or DS9, is really present in this and the closing scene has to be one of the series all time best, if not the very best. If only the movies with this cast could have been this good... Trivia note, the only cast member in tears when 'Cut' was yelled was poor Michael Dorn!

The last scene at the poker table where each cast member say their final lines, always chokes me up.I was an American living in Germany in early 1987 when I heard the news about a new Star Trek series. Of course I thought this was nuts and thought there was no way it was going to be better than TOS.I came back to the US during the 3rd year of the show. At a dinner at my friend's house the opening music played on the TV in the background. He said ""It's STtNG, check it out, it's really good."" That was an understatement...

To wrap things up even more Q appears and has apparently placed humanity back on trial as a savage warlike race. However this time it is Picard himself who has caused the destruction and unravelling of the universe itself, although he has no idea how? When I first saw this double episode adventure I was a major fan of the series and having been largely disappointed with series 7 was hoping I would get a big finish to the series and I was not disappointed. The story is great and continues very much in the vain of the last Q episode ""Tapestry"" arguably up there as one of the best Q episodes ever. The performances by the cast are verging on perfect as they have got to the point where the characters are like a favourite suit that you were with pride and panache, because you know that whatever happens, you're gonna look great in it. The effects are great and there are some truly fantastic images and moments that are so well written that it brings home everything that we love about trek. The direction is flawless and the ending is so amazing that it almost makes me cry.Better than all the next gen films out together and so sad that they couldn't do it on the big screen. However for non-next gen aficionados check out the best eps from the first seven series before you see this one, as you have to get the meaning from the other shows before you can appreciate this.It was the best series ending till ""Doctor Who's Army of Ghosts and Doomsday"" but it's the best finale to a series that wraps everything up beautifully.

Why do we see three different Picards at three different points (seven years ago, the present and in the more distant future)? All of this is explained, to a degree, when Picard realizes Q is behind all this in this episode that clearly seems to have been inspired by ""A Christmas Carol"".While I did enjoy seeing the past, present and futures for the Enterprise crew, this is once again a time travel episode which is jam-packed full of scientific nonsense and solutions that are made up of lots of meaningless buzzwords (temporal inversions, anti-time and much more).

24,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" All Good Things... (TV Episode 1994)",Finest TNG Episode Ever Filmed,"The finest TNG episode ever filmed.A time travel story in the hands of lesser writers can be a hackneyed plot device to cover up weaknesses with a bad script or weak acting.Not here. The story expands character development and is a sustained study on how we deal with life choices, what we learn from them and how we grow as persons.This is a far more important message than the anomaly, Q's power or everything else going on that Captain Picard doesn't understand happening around him. This is NOT a spoiler - people can read other reviews for that. My intention is to draw out certain lessons we can discover in this episode and people can surely find others for themselves as well.We are made to care because he and people he is close to don't always appreciate why he does what he does and there is a certain truth to the old adage that with age comes wisdom and youth is wasted on the young.We all look back on our lives and wonder if we lived as well as we could have and if we could really change who we are, we would be happier. I keep thinking of the famous scene in Proust that every one remembers by heart - where a little lump of sugar dissolved in a cup of tea compel the narrator to recall his life and an incident Picard initially gives no real thought to suddenly has profound meaning for his entire life.The episode forces us to think big and it also in a poignant way affirms for us the importance of family and friends and in the closing scene, Captain Picard resolves never again to take for granted the Enterprise family when he joins them for the first time in their card game on board the ship.In a word, the acting, storyline and feel here is top notch and is what fans expect of the Star Trek canon and it also serves as a bookend as it were, to the opening episode, ""Encounter At Farpoint"" - that launched TNG (though people who have never watched the show don't have to watch everything else that went on before to enjoy a piece of great story-telling) and returns the show as it were back to its roots - showing that it remembers and honors them. Its a magnificent curtain call to arguably the greatest science fiction show of all time.",10
