0,"""Star Trek"" The Pirates of Orion (TV Episode 1974)","Superb Little ""Star Trek"" Adventure","Excellent ""Star Trek"" installment here any way you slice it, and one of the more successful episodes from the short lived Animated Series adventures from 1973/1974. It is easy to dismiss the series but by golly there is some decent Star Trek to be had in the scant 22 episodes produced, and this is one of my favorite examples to point to.First time writer Howard Weinstein and series creator Gene Roddenberry dug back into the Original Series and its traditions to craft a tightly wound story hinging on one of the show's favorite standby plot devices: Spock's Vulcan physique, specifically Vulcanian sensitivity to a particular space virus that doesn't effect humans but is fatal to Vulcans. Only a rare drug found on few worlds can save him, and a rendezvous with a dilithium freighter is arranged to give Spock a fighting chance to survive.Wouldn't you know it, the pesky Orions from ""Journey To Babel"" are back, with a small pirate vessel intercepting the freighter, making off with the precious drug, and setting off a classic Trek race against time to track down the pirates & retrieve the drug before Spock goes belly up. Which isn't quite as easy as it sounds, with the Orion's custom of suicide before capture and their use of an asteroid field of unstable explosive planetoids to elude the Enterprise raising the ante to even stakes against a fully armed Federation warship.It all leads up to a fairly tense personal confrontation between Captain Kirk and the Orion commander that is played totally seriously with the threat of death & destruction for all. Pretty advanced viewing for a children's show, as concepts like dying in a huge explosion, one's duty to their world, and ritualistic suicide customs being raised. Even the Orion bad guys come off pretty good, the commander matter-of-factly stating in a superbly written scene that Orion's neutrality comes before the well being of his ship or its crew, and it is not the ravings of a madman.The episode is fast paced, adventuresome, filled with technical lingo that never goes over the head of even the youngest viewer, and most importantly *feels* like a real Star Trek episode. And indeed the usual emphasis on eye popping animated space creatures & situations where the writers could indulge their fantasies without fear of budget constraints is set aside for a sort of hard edged functional feel. This could just as easily been a live action Original Series episode, where many of the Animated Series episodes could not have been staged as they were drawn & rotoscoped.So here is a great example of the Animated Series delivering classic Star Trek by any other name (pun intended). It is a shame that Mr. Roddenberry and his marketing directors chose to de-canonize the Animated Series, a situation that was only set to rights after his passing and the restructuring of the Star Trek franchise. Some of the Animated Series adventures are marvelous examples of the best of what the whole concept of Star Trek had to offer, and it is gratifying to see episodes like this finally receiving the attention they were due.7/10; Even non-fans will find this installment entertaining, and it so involving you may even forget you are watching a cartoon.",7
1,"""Star Trek"" The Pirates of Orion (TV Episode 1974)",One of the Better Ones,"In ""The Pirates of Orion"" a disease fairly harmless to humans but deadly to Vulcans infects the crew of the ship. Spock falls ill and the Enterprise must rendezvous with another Federation ship to get the necessary medicine to cure him before he expires.When the Enterprise makes it to the meeting point though, the Potemkin has been attacked and pillaged by pirates. They track the warp trail to a ship of Orion pirates. Catching them in the act jeopardizes the Orion Syndicate's neutrality with the Federation. Kirk promises not to report them if they give up the medicine and walk away.The two dueling captains beam down to an asteroid to make the exchange. Kirk gets the medicine but the Orions attempt a double-cross, a suicide bombing destroying both ships and keeping the piracy a secret. Kirk stops them and arrests the captain. Spock gets his medicine and survives.Season 2 of TAS is off to a surprisingly good start. The plot of this is coherent and tight for the short runtime. We get to see more of the Orions, a species I love that doesn't get enough screentime. Ignoring the fact that not having this medicine already on board a giant ship feels a but dumb, I couldn't help but rather enjoy this one.",6
2,"""Star Trek"" The Pirates of Orion (TV Episode 1974)",Spock Is Sick,"Spock gets a disease that attacks his bloodstream. There is only one place to get the stuff needed to cure him. Unfortunately, it takes too long to get there. Spock will die unless they have a rendezvous with a cargo ship. That ship is attacked by Orions (pronounced or-ee-ons). They are pirates and attack the cargo ship, taking everything on board. They are not open to negotiations because they will anger the Federation. Kirk meets with one of them. They have a code of death they live by. The ending is pretty weak and not much fun.",6
3,"""Star Trek"" The Pirates of Orion (TV Episode 1974)",Far better than usual,"Far better than usual is in reference to this cartoon series. Normally, I'd give one of the shows a 4--this time it's a bit better due to slightly better writing. As for the animation, however, it's about the same quality as usual...terrible. As always for the show, the cell count is minuscule and this means robotic movement. Also, the characters are just terribly drawn--like a group of 8th graders made the thing.The story finds Mr. Spock ill with a disease that won't kill humans...but it does kill Vulcans. The problem is that it's too far to go to get the medicine he needs, so they need to rely on a ship to bring it towards them and they'll race to get the needed drug. Unfortunately, space pirates steal the stuff and Kirk needs to convince the pirates to be nice guys and give it back! The story ain't great and the ending is a bit limp but at least it is a story- -the type you might have actually seen on the original ""Star Trek"". No stupid looking aliens and nothing that would irritate Trekkies.",6
0,"""Star Trek"" Bem (TV Episode 1974)",Star Trek: Bem,"The Enterprise is studying a planet yet charted, carrying along a passenger (an alien commander named Bem (voiced by James Doohan)) that causes Kirk and Spock much headache once they transport to the surface. On the uncharted planet are ""aboriginal"" lifeforms, primitive to a point (they do have tepees, fashioned spears, and wooden ""holding cells"" for uninvited visitors, yet these creatures don't seem to be hostile as much as cautious and untrustworthy), ""under watch"" by a ""paternal"" god-like entity that exists as a type of protection for her ""children"" (the entity is voiced by Nichelle Nichols). Bem is from a type of species that acts unpredictably (and can ""split"" into several ""pieces"" that seem to function through the commandment of the head's brain!!!), judging the human decisions and reactions of Kirk (considered a top officer and elite among his peers) as evidence for whether or not the Federation will have further dealings with its kind. How Kirk and Spock escape from the capture of the planet's entity and inhabitants will indicate to Bem if the Federation should be considered worthy of future relations. Being used as experiments in Bem's study of them doesn't sit well in Kirk, while Spock finds his behavior fascinating. Like the original series before it, this '74 cartoon featured stories similar in nature: how will Kirk and company avoid/avert dangerous situations and enhance their stature among newly discovered (or known) species. Sometimes situations develop where the Enterprise and crew are pulled into danger not of their own making: in the case of this episode, Bem drags Kirk and Spock into a conflict with a species that could have been avoided through peaceable introduction. Bem splits from the group (both literally and figuratively), with Kirk and Spock having to follow after him. Bem is their responsibility and gets purposely captured just to see if Kirk and Spock could not only rescue him but to investigate how they would interact with the inhabitants. Ultimately, Bem finds itself wrong and speaks of ""disassembling"" (or destroying itself) but the planet's protective entity (it has the power to ""halt"" any species on the planet and destroy their threatening weapons if so choosing) isn't about to allow such a rash self-destructive decision just because it made bad mistakes/choices. The writing, like on the show, for the cartoon wasn't too dumbed down which is nice. Intelligent results exist due to the characters involved coming to an agreement and talking out their issues (the planet is to be ""quarantined"" and left alone so that the Enterprise and crew can leave without harm) reasonably. Maybe the show might be a bit over the head of some children, but intelligent writing in a cartoon is refreshing. Star Trek fans will enjoy this, I think, and that's what matters in the end.",7
1,"""Star Trek"" Bem (TV Episode 1974)",What Was That All About?,"In ""Bem"", the Enterprise is cruising around with a representative from a new Ally of the Federation. Bem and a few crewman popped down to an unexplored planet to study the natives. Bem runs off and gets himself captured. The rest of the episode is Kirk and Spock trying to rescue the guy who can split his body apart since he's actually a colony being.This one's real rough to get through. I'm struggling down the home stretch of the Animated Series. There are a handful of good episodes and a few cool characters and ideas but a lot of this is TOS reject stuff that they slapped onto TAS and called it a day. Nothing good or fun going on in this one.",2
2,"""Star Trek"" Bem (TV Episode 1974)",BEM is pretty weird...and annoying.,"As usual, the animation quality of the show is sub-par--even by 1970s standards (which were extremely low to begin with). The cell count (which controls the fluidity and realism of the animation) is terrible, the drawings amateurish (as if done by children) and the show is an abomination to lovers of animation. Trek fans might be more forgiving of this than most because of their love of the franchise, but objectively speaking it is a lousy looking episode.As for the plot, a Mr. BEM is serving, temporarily, aboard the Enterprise. This weird looking alien starts behaving strangely on a landing party and he's replaced Kirk and Spock's communicators with non-working fakes. It turns out he's testing the two to determine if the Federation is civilized or not--and there is a strange disembodied voice who gets involved as well. Do they pass? And who is that weird voice?This show is kind of weird, as Mr. BEM can split in pieces and do really weird things! As it's a cartoon, this is possible--but there is no way such a character would have been possible on the live action show! Was it good? Not especially good but watchable if you are a die-hard Trek fan. Otherwise, easy to skip--mostly because the BEM character is so stupid and annoying.",4
3,"""Star Trek"" Bem (TV Episode 1974)",How the Grinch Fooled Enterprise,"I'm sorry. This is beyond stupid. Kirk and the Gang and an alien named Ben try to do research on a planet. Kirk relents when the alien keeps at him about going to the surface. Once there, he screws up everything they try to do. He looks like a Grinch in a space suit. He speaks a kind of baby talk. He has the ability to split himself into several pieces which allows him to escape from things. Just a poor excuse for an episode.",3
0,"""Star Trek"" The Practical Joker (TV Episode 1974)",The holodeck makes its first appearance,"This was actually the first Star Trek episode to feature the Holodeck--called the 'Rec Room' here. So, The Practical Joker enjoys an important link to Star Trek: The Next Generation where the holodeck appears so prominently. The Enterprise accidentally enter into Romulan territory and Kirk is now pursued by the Romulans. The crew try to elude the Romulans by entering an energy field...but the field is alive and seizes control of the Enterprise's computer where it launches one 'joke'/trick after another upon the Federation crew. The crew were able to create any environment they choose with the use of the computer (basically the holodeck) but it malfunctions since the energy field places McCoy, Uhura and Sulu in several inhospitable situations. The Enterprise eventually escape the cloud and the pursing Romulans now get entangled in the same cloud instead. Other than the holodeck link with TNG, The Practical Joker was OK but not outstanding.",7
1,"""Star Trek"" The Practical Joker (TV Episode 1974)",I think the practical joke here was on whoever sat through this!,"In ""The Practical Joker"", after fleeing from a Romulan attack through an odd energy field, the Enterprise begins to act strangely. The computer is playing practical jokes on the crew and they become more and more dangerous. Bones, Sulu, and Uhura get caught in a snowstorm in the rec room, laughing gas is pouring through the ship, and the Romulans are in hot pursuit of the Enterprise.In the end, Kirk and Spock tricj it into going through the energy field again (which somehow reverses the effect). The Romulans follow them and then their ships begin to act funny as well.The plot to this really makes no sense but it's cool seeing the initial stage of the Holodeck I guess? Besides this though, there's not a whole lot to love here unless you're a big fan of prank videos.",3
2,"""Star Trek"" The Practical Joker (TV Episode 1974)",kid's stuff.,"As I always point out, the animation for this show is pure crap. Low cell counts (with jerky, robotic movements) and ugly drawings are the norm for this series--and this one is unfortunately no exception. Even by 70s TV cartoons, this one is butt ugly. The show begins with Romulans attacking Enterprise. The Captain takes the ship through an energy field to avoid them and in the process the computer aboard the ship is affected--becoming goofy and with a bad sense of humor. Dribble glasses, pies in the face graffiti on the Captain's uniform and other simple-minded pranks start occurring and everyone aboard laughs like crazy. Mostly, however, it looks like stuff most children watching the show would have laughed at instead of adults. Well, they eventually discover that the computer is behind all this.This episode is clearly one that kids would love--because they would have thought the computer's jokes were funny. As for older audiences (and it's amazing that adults really embraced this show), it's harder going due to its silliness--which grates on you after a while. My verdict is an 8 for kids and a 5 for adults.By the way, it is interesting that this show debuts the holodeck-- something I incorrectly assumed was created on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"".",5
3,"""Star Trek"" The Practical Joker (TV Episode 1974)",Today Is April 1!!!!,"The Enterprise, chased by the Romulans, has to go through an energy field. After this takes place, lame practical jokes begin happening. It becomes epidemic and is threatening the crew's abilities. It is soon realized that it is the Enterprise, and not a crew member, that is the cause of all this. Soon after this, the ship puts out Nitrous Oxide and the crew can't stop laughing. This is another one of the more childish episodes that didn't bring this show back for another season.",5
4,"""Star Trek"" The Practical Joker (TV Episode 1974)",Star Trek: The Practical Joker,"""Practical Joker"" might be considered one of the sillier episodes of the cartoon of the original series of Star Trek, but I think it has some cool things to offer fans. Like the initial attack by Romulan warbirds who claim that the Enterprise has invaded their space--in turn breaking the Neutral Zone treaty--while studying asteroids during a routine mission, the ""rec room"" (clearly an inspiration for the Holodeck on The Next Generation) where Doctor McCoy, Uhura, and Suli become trapped and toyed with, and an inflatable Enterprise surprising the Romulans who halt a potential attack on the real vulnerable Enterprise. The plot involves, believe it or not, the Enterprise ""having a nervous breakdown"" (as explained by Spock as a ship behaving illogically, therefore perplexing his logical mind) after the ship travels through an energy field to avoid further damage by the Romulans. The main computer of the Enterprise begins playing practical jokes on the crew and laughing because of them! Like the food machines suffering malfunctions (at one point, a machine spits out a load of food at Scotty, including a whipped cream pie that splats on his face!), or a release of nitrous oxide causing all on board to suffer the laughing effects of the gas: when Kirk orders Scotty to shut the logic computer off, it retaliates by causing the gravitational systems to usurp their efforts! The rec room situation (where McCoy, Uhura, and Sulu are stuck and cannot get out, with the computer ultimately creating a whiteout snowstorm location for them to suffer before a hedge maze appears with them stuck right in the middle!) is one of the most dangerous that is featured in the episode (which mostly seems geared towards laughs instead of suspense). It is resolved easily, while Kirk outsmarts his ship's paranoid (and practical joking) computer by feigning terror about traveling back through the energy field that caused their current situation. The Romulans seem to have used the asteroid study, claiming invasion of their space, merely as a tactic to engage in battle with the Enterprise, so Kirk's using them as a comic foil by way of a pursuit through the energy field is an amusing counter to their lopsided three-to-one advantage and attack approach. I just had a lot of fun watching this one: it is more aimed at children and features a lot of jokes played on Kirk and crew (Spock's eye-viewer gag, the dribbling drinking glasses, and laughing gas sequence are all amusing touches, as is the computer itself laughing gleefully at the crew). I think this is a good example of how the cartoon format can be beneficial in presenting imaginative moments that a feature television series (at that time) weren't quite able to do, like the rec room's creation of locations through programs, or the gravitational reaction of the computer leaving Scotty floating and needing to crawl out of Engineering on all fours, upside down, across the ceiling, just to exit safely. A cartoon did have advantages: ideas that weren't economically feasible on a television format were possible in animated form.",7
0,"""Star Trek"" Albatross (TV Episode 1974)",Actually Pretty Decent,"In ""Albatross"", after delivering medical supplies to a distant Federation contact, Dr. McCoy is placed under arrest for causing an epidemic 19 years ago that wiped at a sister planet. His sloppy medical practices allegedly caused thousands to die. The Enterprise heads to the planet to investigate as Bones sits in a jail cell. After finding a local to testify on McCoy's behalf, the entire crew (besides Spock) plus the witness comes down with the plague. Spock must spring McCoy from the clink in order to find an antidote in time and clear Bones' good name.This is one of the highlights of the series. It's got a good story and actual stakes on the line. We meet a new alien race with a swift justice system. Besides the abysmal animation and the corny ending, this episode is fairly well done.",6
1,"""Star Trek"" Albatross (TV Episode 1974)",Surprisingly good.,"""Albatross"" is a surprisingly good episode of ""Star Trek the Animated Series"". Now I am NOT saying it's well-animated. No, as usual the animation really sucks as the characters move in a very robotic fashion and the quality of many (but not all) of the drawings is suspect. But the story itself is MUCH closer to the style of the original ""Star Trek""--something severely lacking in many of the cartoons. Many feel like they are more designed for kids and not for Trek-lovers--which was probably the case back in 1974. This one, on the other hand, could have been hashed out into a decent script for a live-action show.As for the show, Dr. McCoy helps a race of beings on a far off planet. For his troubles, he is arrested--and charged with killing off a race on a nearby planet 19 years ago! So, it's like the old saying ""No good deed goes unpunished"" and McCoy and his BFFs need to reconstruct events to determine if McCoy's vaccinations of these people long ago led to a plague (Jenny McCarthy, take note). Overall, not great because of the craptastic animation. But tolerable because of the good script.",7
2,"""Star Trek"" Albatross (TV Episode 1974)",You Can't Get a Break,"Leonard McCoy helps one race, only to cause problems for another. Circumvention is necessary or he may face death or imprisonment for good. The simplistic nature of these cartoon entries makes it hard to attend to them. The animation is very weak, with little movement. The story lines don't seem very interesting, and the solutions seem to be a little too easy. Imagine an animated effort with some heart and effort.",6
0,"""Star Trek"" How Sharper Than a Serpent's Tooth (TV Episode 1974)",Who Mourns For KULKULKAN?,"HOW SHARPER THAN A SERPENT'S TOOTH was yet another ""variation on a theme"" regarding aliens who were either obsessed with Earth in the past or had visited there and had an impact on Earth's history: THE SQUIRE OF GOTHOS, WHO MOURNS FOR ADONAIS?, THE MAGICKS OF MEGAS-TU, or, in DOCTOR WHO terms, THE DAEMONS. Here's it's the winged serpent Kulkulkan, who influenced the Mayan civilization (and apparently also influenced The Toltecs and The Chinese). The closest parallel here would be ""Apollo"", and this almost feels like a remake of his story, only with more ""sci-fi"" elements, and about a hundred times the budget (if it had been live-action instead of a cartoon).Once more ""predicting"" much-later developments (despite incessant protests, it seems painfully clear the people who worked on the various STAR TREK spin-offs were influenced by THESE CARTOONS) is helmsman ""Ensign Walking Bear"", a member of the Cherokee tribe who says he's studied the history of many Native American cultures. (""Chakotay"" on VOYAGER is rather similar-- a Native American turns up, and his whole personality seems to be summed up by being the ""expert"" when it comes to ""Native American"" things. George Takei objected to that sort of thing-- it's why in THE NAKED TIME he used a rapier and was obsessed with D'Artagnon, instead of using a samurai sword as originally suggested.) Once again we have an alien being who ""helped"" mankind in the distant past, is bugged that they have ""forgotten"" him, and still insists on thinking of them as his ""chidren"". It takes quite a bit of effort of Kirk's part, but, EVENTUALLY, he convinces Kulkulkan that mankind has ""grown up"", that while still a violent species they use their minds and put every effort into living in peace, and that ""any intelligent species cannot be simply led by the hand"".Some of the design work in here is impressive, including Kulkulkan's spaceship, the Mayan city (presumably some sort of holographic creation), and the ""zoo"" which collects various animals in such a way they they each believe they're in their natural environments, and are unaware they're really in tiny glass enclosures).Perhaps the most annoying thing in this episode (apart fro Kulkulkan's general attitude for most of it) is the way William Shatner MIS-PROPNOUNCES Kulkulkan's name every single time he says it (as ""Ku-KLU-Kan""-- did he think the serpent was wearing a white robe or something?).I got a laugh when Kirk injects the savage ""power cat"" with a tranquilizer and is knocked aside, then McCoy asks him, ""Did you inject the cat, or yourself?"" The ending of the story manages to find an excuse to squeeze in yet another Shakespeare reference, which is where the story gets its name-- ""How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have an ungrateful child.""Writer David Wise has had a long career, mostly writing cartoons, while his collaborator, Russell Bates, only ever did this and an episode of ISIS. In both cases, this was their first TV work.Not one of my favorites, but I still wish this series had continued on a lot longer than it did. It's just disgraceful that Filmnation only did 6 episodes the 2nd season, and then that was it.",7
1,"""Star Trek"" How Sharper Than a Serpent's Tooth (TV Episode 1974)","Ambitious Cartoon ""Trek"" With Ideas For Future Installments","The Animated ""Star Trek"" series from 1973 - 1974 was an odd bird to begin with, and this may be its most bizarre installment that actually suggests a few ideas the franchise would later re-visit on a grander scale.An ""unidentified space probe"" leaving a swath of destruction in its path is headed right for the Earth, and only James Tiberious Kirk & the crew of his USS Enterprise stand between it and certain doom. The probe refuses to answer any hailing frequency communication attempts and brushes aside any attempts to stop it. The Enterprise engages the ship and finds that it is a ceramic based craft of infinite age, piloted by an equally infinitely old being known as Kukulkan, who had visited Earth eons before to teach humans to evolve into a technically sophisticated civilization patterned on the Mayans & Toltecs who would worship the being as a god.Pretty heavy stuff for Saturday morning cartoon fare with some really cool art designs depicting a vision of the city that the being had envisioned, made of architectural components from various human civilizations like the Meso Americans, the Khmer people's Angkor Wat, the ancient Egyption obelisks, etc. Which is ironic given William Shatner's own preoccupation with the ""Ancient Astronauts"" theories he explored in a highly entertaining documentary released on home video under such dubious titles as CAPTAIN KIRK'S ALIEN MYSTERIES and MYSTERIES OF THE GODS. I watched it yesterday and wondered where I'd heard about jungle pyramids + Captain Kirk before. Huh.The basic idea of an implacable alien space probe on a single minded mission to destroy the Earth because of antiquated events (the Voyager space missions, the near extinction of the whale species in our oceans) would later find greater form in STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE and STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME. Though the concept had been familiar to the Trek universe since the dynamite 2nd season Original Series episode ""The Changeling"", which also has a mutated alien space probe on its way to apparently destroy the Earth while on some cosmic quest for knowledge.And the idea of humans coming in contact with ancient intelligences also figured directly into three Original Series episodes: ""The Immunity Syndrome"", ""Return To Tomorrow"", and the likewise sprawlingly titled ""For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky"". By simply shuffling around previously used ideas, writers Russel Bates & David Wise managed to come up with something familiar yet new. If anything the episode is a little overburdened with good ideas and the story feels rushed. I wish we'd been able to learn more about Kukulkan's voyages through space & time.That lunkheaded 1974 era network television would actually allow such complex ideas to take form in entertainment primarily aimed at children is nothing short of remarkable -- A marvelous fluke, which pretty much sums up the whole Animated Series experience. It's unique stuff that has long deserved a proper place in the Star Trek franchise, and thanks to the DVD age & the internet your own Complete Series box set is only a few mouse clicks away.6/10",6

It was clearly a sub-par and rather embarrassing episode where the Greek god, Apollo, captured the Enterprise and brought some of the crew down to his planet in order to be worshiped. Yet, someone DID decide to do just that--and they managed to make the plot even a bit stupider!When the show begins, Mr. Sulu is NOT at the helm--so you know that there is some reason for this. Sure enough, when a weird spacecraft arrives and takes hold of Enterprise, this never before or since seen crew member just happens to be in the right place at the right time. He is the only one among the crew that recognize their captor. It's Kukulkan (also known to the Aztecs as Quetelcoatl)-- the Mayan bird/serpent god!! What follows is just stupid.While many episodes of the old cartoon series are decent plots marred by bad animation, this particular one doesn't even have a decent plot--just bad animation and a re-tread plot.

Written by Sam Peeples, the same chap who penned the 2nd ""Star Trek"" pilot ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"", this one has same authority to its storytelling and plays very much like a classic era episode in spite of its cartoonish roots: While on a ""routine"" star charting assignment the Enterprise finds itself drawn to a dead planet orbiting a dead star. Locked in orbit is a massive, intricate, derelict alien spacecraft that has been trapped there for uncountable eons of time. Kirk leads an away team to explore the eerie derelict and discovers that its not quite as uninhabited as originally believed. After finding a warning message from the ship's long dead & fossilized captain, the away team departs only to find that a formless energy being has come back with them. And it wants the Enterprise for a very specific, horrifying purpose.The episode is fast paced, serious in tone, introduces us to the Life Support Belt concept that would allow the animators to place the familiar characters in more fantastic circumstances like the vacuum of space, and concludes with the classic stock device of a self destruct countdown of sorts. You can do much worse for ""Star Trek"" material regardless of how it was made, and I'd actually rank this up there with ""Arena"" and ""The Tholian Web"" as one of ""Star Trek""'s most effective television adventures. It was a great choice as the installment to introduce the animated series to viewers.The episode also serves a curious footnote in the development of what would eventually become ALIEN (1979), believe it or not. Or rather I suspect it may have suggested ideas to the late writer Dan O'Bannon, whom I have been thinking about a lot since his sad passing away in December of 2009. First you have the idea of finding a derelict, abandoned spacecraft trapped in the vicinity of a dead planet. Then you have your basic warning message left by a fossilized member of the crew, who's corpse is propped up next to the viewing screen for good measure, both ideas that also harken back to Mario Bava's PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES (1965) and Roger Corman's QUEEN OF BLOOD (1966).Then you have your standard alien life form sneaking back onto the ship where it does battle with the human crew, ala FORBIDDEN PLANET (1956) and IT! TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE (1959) QUEEN OF BLOOD, PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES, and even THE THING (1952). The creature even lacks a discernible form like the Id creature from FORBIDDEN PLANET and very much like the shape-shifting life form that would evolve into the H.R. Giger designed Alien -- a creature who's shape is defined by genetic mutation based on its host organism's structure.The episode even concludes with a sequence where the crew has to work themselves into a frenzy to destroy the ship before the creature can use it to get back to civilized portions of the galaxy and eventually take over, reproducing itself by mitosis, a concept that would also find form in John Carpenter's 1982 remake of THE THING, as well as Allan Holzman's overlooked MUTANT (or FORBIDDEN WORLD) which also features a shape shifting genetically mutated life form preying on humans. Heck if the very robot-like Spock had been an android we'd have a working proof here, though the android ""Ash"" character from ALIEN was a later addition to the screenplay by other hands.So you know, what ever; O'Bannon certainly would have had a chance to see the show during the period 1974 - 1976 in which he was developing the story idea that would become ALIEN. I can sort of picture O'Bannon and Ron Shusset with their TV on one Saturday morning as they were getting started with the day's writing, and all of a sudden their eyes light up as they watch this cartoonized version of one of their favorite shows. Heck I can even map out Amando de Ossorio pillaging that ""Scooby Doo Where Are You?"" episode with the ghost pirate ship & the giggling green ghoul for his GHOST SHIP OF THE BLIND DEAD Euro Horror favorite. Inspiration can come from the damndest places sometimes! 9/10",9
1,"""Star Trek"" Beyond the Farthest Star (TV Episode 1973)",One of my favorite episodes.,"A little more inventive (though somewhat stark) than some of the more recent sci-fi offerings, the voice acting and backgrounds offset stagnated and sparse animation. Even so the actors are more speaking into a microphone while using their character's voice, as opposed to letting themselves get entirely into characters and emote in full.The story, though basic, is highlighted with some rather interesting premises. The driving character's motive is only loosely touched on, and never fully explored. Most likely this was done to placate to both an adult and child audience for easy story digestion.Character development is kept to a minimum for both crew and opposition, leaving a rather sparse yet interesting installment into the franchise.",
2,"""Star Trek"" Beyond the Farthest Star (TV Episode 1973)",Star Trek: Season 4 Opener?,"""Beyond the Farthest Star"" is the pilot to Star Trek: The Animated Series or Season 4 of Star Trek as some fans like to call it. In it, the crew encounters an ancient abandoned starship of complex figuration. It appears to be empty so the crew beams aboard to investigate. They find that the original crew destroyed the ship in order to stop the evil that had invaded the ship's systems.After accidentally bringing it aboard the Enterprise, the crew must think fast before it takes over all the systems and begins spreading over all the starships in the galaxy. Spock and Kirk pretend to suicide dive the Enterprise into a nearby planet, causing the being to jettison itself at the last minute before the Enterprise course-corrects into a slingshot movement that breaks them free of the being and the planet. They head on to chart more stars.Woof! A very inauspicious start to The Animated Series. The animation style is cheap and not thrilling (this was to be expected in this time period) but I at least thought we might get a solid storyline and arc. The plot is extremely hard to follow in this one. I suppose this might be a theme (due to the short 20 minute run time.) I did see some potential pros of this being animated. We have already introduced an alien lifeform aboard the Enterprise with a cool design. TOS didn't have the money or the capability to introduce such characters so hopefully over the course of the 2 seasons this runs, we will get into cooler character designs. The show also expands on the Star Trek universe.We are introduced to a new piece of technology that allows the characters to roam deep space without any kind of specialty space suits. The Life Support Belts allowed the animators to explore new boundaries without having to spend a lot of time on complex space exploration attire (always comes down to money).But this episode is still a mess. I hope there are better episodes to be found in the future.",4

5,"""Star Trek"" Beyond the Farthest Star (TV Episode 1973)",Ugly animation and a semi-decent story.,"I noticed that many folks who saw this animated series gave it scores like 9 or 10. Well, that is ridiculous, as the animation quality is just horrible--even by the low standards of the 1970s. So much of it looks like a terrible slide show and the ship the Enterprise encounters is a garish acid-trip sort of thing. As for the crews, the voices were the original characters but the animation made everyone look zombie-like! So, while the notion of being sucked towards a dead sun where a magnetic entity takes over the ship and, in essence, becomes the ship is interesting, the overall effect is severely muted due to Filmation's insistence that the show look like a pile of crap. I would give the story a 6. It was reasonably interesting but underdeveloped. The dialog was rather stilted. The animation I would give a negative 4 if it was allowed, but IMDb likes scores between 1 and 10--so I'll score this a 1! Overall, a score of 3 seems reasonable and that's a bad indication as to what is likely to come in the next 21 episodes!",3
0,"""Star Trek"" Yesteryear (TV Episode 1973)",perhaps the best in the animated series,"I am not huge fan of the Star Trek: Animated Series, but i loved this episode. It has a Guardian of Forever, Spock traveling through time to save himself, his ""large teddy bear with six-inch fangs"" pet, that is a reference from the Original Series, and lots of Vulcan logic :)You can also see Spock getting emotional as a kid, fighting with other kids, and being a child of two worlds. Realising of this is critical for understanding of this versatile character.So, this is a pleasant episode to watch.I rate this episode 9/10.",10
1,"""Star Trek"" Yesteryear (TV Episode 1973)",Trek's Animated High Point,"The twenty-two animated episodes of Star Trek aired on NBC across 1973-74 tend to be overlooked these days. It isn't hard to understand how that might be given the bias against animation to simply ""be for kids"" that it is still struggling with even today. Yet Star Trek: The Animated Series featured not only the original series cast reprising their roles but also saw writers from the original series (as well as others such as Larry Niven) returning to pen new tales for the Enterprise crew. One of the most intriguing episodes to come out of this brief run was Yesteryear, a story that took the show's most iconic character back to his earliest days.Yesteryear opens with the familiar pair of Kirk and Spock returning through the Guardian Of Forever from observing the birth of the Orion civilization. They are met by a group of Starfleet historians and an Andorian in Starfleet uniform whom everyone present (including Dr. McCoy) swears is the first officer of the Enterprise instead of Spock. In this new timeline, Spock died at the age of seven during the Vulcan Kahs-wan ritual whereas he had been saved originally by an adult relative. Realizing that the relative must have been himself, Spock travels through the gateway into Vulcan's past to try and save his younger self without contaminating the timeline any further.Though never quite satisfactorily explained in the episode how the situation was created by Spock being in the past while the historians were using the gateway, the episode nonetheless remains intriguing. Though Spock's past had been hinted at in the original series, most especially in episodes like Journey To Babel (written by this episode's writer Dorothy C. Fontana) and Amok Time, it was in the animated series that fans finally got to see Vulcan properly nearly a decade before Star Trek III did it on the big screen. We see cities and beasts only hinted at in those episodes including Spock's childhood pet that becomes a key plot point here. Not only that but fans got a look at life and culture on Vulcan in general but especially through the eyes of a youth who stands out from those his age because of his heritage. This is a prime example of what the animated Trek, not bound quite so much by budgets to create its visuals, could accomplish.What's even more surprising, for an episode of a series that was seen at aimed for children, is how it dealt with Spock's youth. Spock is tormented by others his age over his heritage, which causes the young boy much anguish and which Leonard Nimoy's voice acting brings across quite well as he watches events he lived through. We see young Spock struggle not only with this mixed heritage but also with the results of his actions as he tries to live up to the expectations laid upon him by his father (voiced once again by Mark Lenard) including making a surprisingly mature decision late in the episode. For a early-mid 1970s Saturday morning cartoon its surprisingly good stuff.That being said, the episode suffers from many of the same issues that the animated series on the whole dealt with. The animation is vaguely defined at times showing the limitations of Filmmation's budgets as things often fall into shadows or (as the case during some of the scenes in the desert) playing them in silhouette. While the voice acting from original series cast members is good with Nimoy in particular being a standout, the younger members of the cast never come across as well with Billy Simpson never quite managing to sound convincingly like he isn't reading off a page in his reading of the young Spock, his interactions with Nimoy do work for the most part. Despite these flaws, Yesteryear represents something of a high point for the animated series. It presents, in a mere 22 minutes a time travel story that allows for the exploration of the early days of one of Trek's most iconic characters with depth rarely expected from a series that was seen as predominately aimed at children. The fact that its influence can be felt in Trek right up to the present day is a testament to its success as well and how animated Trek should not be so easily dismissed.",7

Something must have happened when he was a boy with a Vulcan father (Sarek) and a human mother. He must find out what the variable is and change it before he returns. This is a really good episode.

Yet here we are using it for scientific research in this episode. I understand why the writers did it though. It's a cool concept and an easy way to incorporate time travel without having to set up your own device in anyway.The lack of quality in the animation is still an issue for this episode (and all of them) but the quality of the plot and ideas make up for this in some capacity.

Spock is now dead, and the only way to set things right is for him to travel back in time and save his younger self.Written by Star Trek vet D.C. Fontana, this is a thoughtful, mature story that feels very kindred to its live action incarnation. Some of the time traveling science is a bit wonky, but that's usually the case with such stories.I've watched a selection of ST:TAS over the last few months, and I've come away impressed each time by its refusal to dumb down the stories to fit the format.The Guardian of Forever is the entity/time portal featured in the classic TOS episode ""City on the Edge of Forever"".Actor Mark Lenard returned here to voice Spock's Father, Sarek.There's a scene here that is very similar to one in JJ Abrams' 2009 Star Trek film, with a young Spock being bullied by classmates.- According to Wikipedia, this was the first episode of ST:TAS aired in the Los Angeles market, even though it was intended to be the second episode. That's because actor George Takei, who plays Sulu, was running for public office at the time.

5,"""Star Trek"" Yesteryear (TV Episode 1973)",This episode makes reference to previous episodes in the live action series...and I appreciate that.,"I have only watched a couple of the animated ""Star Trek"" shows so far. Despite overwhelmingly positive reviews, the shows are incredibly poorly animated. Fortunately, ""Yesteryear"" has enough going for it that it still makes it worth seeing despite the really crappy animation.When the episode begins, Kirk and a landing party are revisiting the same planet from the episode ""City on the Edge of Forever"" (the Edith Keeler episode). The fact that they are there is a bit confusing since at the end of this live action show, Kirk is very clear that he never wants to come there again--and he said something along the lines of ""Let's get the hell out of here"". Despite this inconsistency, the rest of the show is actually quite good and it goes places the old show probably couldn't go.After going on a brief journey through the time portal, the party returns and no one recognizes Spock! How could this be?! Well, it turned out that Spock died when he was 11--or at least that will be the case unless Spock uses the portal and goes back to prevent his own death.This episode is nice because you get to hear Mark Lenard as Surak-- and there are several nods to another episodes--including ""Journey to Babel"". His wife, however, is not voiced by Jane Wyatt but Majel Barrett. Overall, this show is definitely oriented towards kids but the show had some nice lessons, some nice nods to previous shows and fits pretty nicely into the Trek canon. I would give this one a higher score had the animators not been lemurs!! Looks like crap but is worth seeing.",7

This has a lot of conflict the Enterprise crew will encounter in quite a busy plot for a cartoon of Star Trek. In fact, this episode is so well written and realized, it could have been acceptable for the live action series it emulates! The plot: the Enterprise crew encounters what appears to be a red cloud that seemingly ""eats planets""! In fact, the ship itself is consumed, but their shields keep them from being digested. Get this: the cloud is an actual intelligent life form and a planet lies ahead in its path for consumption that holds millions of people! So Kirk and company must determine a course of action to keep it from reaching the planet and killing all those people while consuming and digesting the planet as a nutritious food.There are a series of decisions and events that emerge giving this episode, ""One of Our Planets is Missing"", a serious consideration for the best of the Star Trek cartoon. Not just that, but I think serious Star Trek fans should seek this episode out and disregard the notion that perhaps a cartoon in the 70s was intentionally written for six year olds. In actuality, I think this episode was written for all manner of ages and intellectually ""One of Our"" has meat on its bones. I love that care was given to the stories during the cartoon's run, as serious dilemmas develop where Kirk and his crew must solve within a small window of time. Here in this episode he has like three hours before the cloud reaches the planet, must contend with antimatter that could explode the ship upon even slight impact, contemplate killing an intelligent life form in order to save millions more, come up with a solution to the energy drained from the Enterprise the longer they remain in the cloud, and consider Spock mind-melding with the cloud in the hopes of talking it out of eating planets containing living beings (and convincing it to return to where it came from). There's an actual mind meld where the cloud enters Spock's body, with Kirk and crew allowing it to see what dies due to its consuming of planetary bodies, with Spock and the cloud actually conversing with each other. Scotty comes up with an ingenious plan to use the antimatter and pieces of the consumed planet (that was uninhabited, which allowed the Enterprise crew to detect the cloud in the first place) as matter to help power the Enterprise.This episode kept coming up with surprises and has so much active plot development; I was always captivated by the construction and conclusion. What an intelligently written show. How the cloud's anatomy is compared to a human's (the use of Dr McCoy is exceptional), and the grueling obstacle of the Prime Directive in terms of killing an intelligent life form further enhance this excellent animated episode which deserves to stand proud alongside its live action big brother.",8

On the other hand, it's not exactly original and the ending is pretty stupid.There's a planet-eating cloud in space. It's going to eat Mantilles and kill millions unless the Enterprise can stop it. But there is a problem--the Prime Directive doesn't want Federation craft killing other life--and the cloud is alive! So what will they do? Yup-- call on Spock to do a mild meld with this thingie and ask it to leave, of course!

Sure, it's just cribbing off of mythology but Star Trek always does that. The super cool part of this episode is Uhura being in charge for the first time in any ST episode. I guess technically T'Pol's probably the first woman in control of a starship chronologically but it's cool they did this female empowerment back in the 70's.Besides these two points though, there's not much else to laud here. The animation is boring as ever. Some of the plot doesn't make sense. (The women are searching for the hiding men but don't think to use the magic computer for help until Uhura asks them).

However, soon it becomes apparent that it's NOT Winston--it's something more akin to Squiddly Diddly!

0,"""Star Trek"" The Magicks of Megas-Tu (TV Episode 1973)",Missing the point,"I think the other reviewer missed the point. This is not a pro-Satan episode; rather, it denies Satan exists at all. To Kirk, Lucien is just another alien being, not a supernatural force; and the religious stories demonizing him into the embodiment of evil are dismissed as mere outmoded superstitions. The ""magick"" is revealed not to be supernatural at all, but simply the physics of that region of space.That a Saturday morning cartoon show, nominally for children, had the guts to tackle a subject of this weight is astonishing. The episode encourages its viewers to question dogma and reject superstition. It's not pro-Satan, just pro-freethinking - though I don't doubt that some parents would call those the same thing, sad to say.",10
1,"""Star Trek"" The Magicks of Megas-Tu (TV Episode 1973)",An Intriguing Tale From The Animated Final Frontier,"Star Trek's brief animated run in the early 1970s is often overlooked these days. It certainly had the shortest run of any of the Star Trek TV shows, lasting 22 episodes across two seasons. Yet the show was not without its highlights such as Yesteryear which explored Spock's childhood. Another would be The Magicks of Megas- tu, the series eighth episode and one that would explore something interesting territory for what was largely considered a show for children.The Enterprise is set on a mission to the center of our galaxy to explore the possible forces of matter creation there, the ship and its crew are caught up in a whirlwind caused by those forces. Ushered into a realm where the usual laws of physics don't need to apply, they encounter a being named Lucien who resembled Pan from mythology who explains and eventually hides the Enterprise crew from the rest of his people. As the crew discovers, the Megans came to Earth in humanity's ancient past in an attempt to be beneficial but were met instead by greed and fear which culminated in the Salem Witch Trials. Humanity finds itself on trial in the form of the Enterprise crew with a last battle of magic to determine the fate of Lucien.Larry Brody's script (which was given a heavy rewrite by Gene Rodenberry) is full of fascinating ideas, many of which seem familiar from other Trek incarnations. The journey to the center of the galaxy leading to the discovery of a supernatural being calls to mind the later Original Series cast film Star Trek V: The Final Frontier. Indeed that film's original concept of Kirk and crew effectively discovering the devil is the same here though Brody was apparently able to get away with it on a Saturday morning cartoon. The middle and final parts of the episode also call to mind the third season episode Plato's Stepchildren though the ideas are both better written and better executed here thanks to animation not suffering from quite the same limitations as the live action series. The trial scene in a court from Earth's past also calls to mind Q's court in the bookending episodes of Next Generation and moments from the Original Series run as well. Also intriguing is the episode's use of magic and items from mythology. Star Trek has played with the idea of magic both with success (the Q character) and with less than stellar results (Catspaw from the Original Series). The setting of a world on the edge between universe's is a neat one and it allows for the episode to do magic seriously without undermining the basic science fiction premise of Trek. The episode also makes neat use of mythology and symbolism which also pre-echoes Star Trek V though, perhaps due to the more condensed running time of 23 minutes, it works in a more satisfying manner here. The episode's final scene with an intriguing intellectual punchline works incredibly well and would likely be a brave move for the franchise today, let alone more than four decades ago.Yet like so much of Star Trek's animated run, it continued to be hampered by production values. All too familiar stock shots of the Enterprise are used again and again in the early parts of this episode with effects simply superimposed over them even as identical shots are repeated. The tendency to let things being played in silhouette or with a lack of detail is present as well as are occasional goofs which mar the entirety of the Animated Series. Yet the animation here might be the strongest in the entire run, especially which the pitch battle at the finale. While still confining the series potential, this episode suffers from it perhaps less than others.In the end, The Magicks of Megas-tu stands out as one of the best episodes of Trek's animated run. It's an episode that explores intriguing territory that pre-echoes what later incarnations of the series would do and even surpasses those later efforts in places. Though hampered by the quality of its animation, like Yesteryear before it, it nevertheless shows the potential of taking Trek into the animated frontier.",7

It really does try to stay true to its live action counterpart both tonally and thematically, with the episodes feeling as if they could have easily been part of the latter with a bit more meat on their, uh, bones.The famously secular humanistic Star Trek often approached the subject of religion in such a fashion as this, but to do so in a 70s cartoon was nothing if not bold, and what's more Star Trek than that? - The character Lucien (later identified as Lucifer) was voiced by James Doohan, better known as Scotty.Not surprisingly, writer Larry Brody originally pitched an idea for the third season of Star Trek that he ultimately shaped and developed into ""The Magicks of Megas-Tu"".",6

When Kirk and Spock reveal Mudd's trick through the use of a shape-shifting creature imitating a lovely woman, they pick up rocks ready to stone the scheming con-artist. Agreeing to return to Enterprise and face criminal charges for fraud and the like, Mudd will need to devise a plan of escaping the brig and ship. The very love crystals he was trying to peddle to the miners actually work much to Mudd's surprise when his manipulation of Nurse Chapel (I like that the show included her character in the cartoon) pays off as he realizes she's crushing on Spock, later learning that the lotion from one of the stones works on the Vulcan! Meanwhile, Mudd gets just enough time out of the brig when Chapel accepts his crystals to capitalize on her momentary faint (the lotion when rubbed on flesh causes this briefly) to swipe her identification card and get access to a phaser device (that deactivates the brig, allowing him to flee).For me, the majority of the fun results from Spock's reaction to the love crystal once he comes in contact with Chapel. I do think Chapel's succumbing to Mudd's sales pitch is a bit far-fetched (I just don't think she would be so gullible to an obvious crook with such a checkered past), but the revelation of her attraction to Spock is a surprise the episode runs with. Spock's devotion to the ""love of his life"" and how Kirk and company respond to him had me in ribbons. The voice-work is priceless here. I'm not going to critique the animation as this was the 70s, and the elaboration of movement wasn't emphasized during a television format as todayfolks, we're spoiled. Anyway, Mudd is able to kidnap Chapel (she faints in his arms!), getting away in a space shuttle, landing on a planet with giant rock creatures chasing after them. Kirk and Spock will need to come to their rescue, but when love crystals get sucked into the ventilation system of the Enterprise, the crew fall under the spell of their effects!

However, instead of just accepting their fate, Kirk wants to try to escape but he needs the cooperation of Captain Klothos of the Klingon ship---but Klothos is a lying jerk-face. The animation is as it always is in these ""Star Trek"" cartoons-- total crap with embarrassingly low cell-counts which make the terrible looking characters movie like robots! To make it worse, one of the female aliens has the highest pitch and most annoying voice acting I can recall ever having heard.As for the story, it fair--about average for the series. The only exception is Spock, who, at times, appears very gay. I don't mean that in a homophobic way--I truly means that he acts like he really, really likes guys...a lot! You have to see it to believe it and, believe it or not, this is the best thing about this particular cartoon.",4
0,"""Star Trek"" The Ambergris Element (TV Episode 1973)","Enjoyable ""Star Trek"" Installment","I would rate writer Margaret Armen's script for ""The Ambergris Element"" to be a decent, enjoyable, worthy example of how the 1974/1974 ""Star Trek: The Animated Series"" attempted to translate the universe of Star Trek into a cartoon show. Very good, but not great on the same plane as ""Yesteryear"", ""The Slaver Weapon"" and ""Beyond The Farthest Star"", which to me represent the most successful episodes from the series where everything came together -- The mythology of Star Trek, the commanding presence of the Original Series voice actors, above average writing and a conscious effort to push the envelope of animation in an effort to both capture the flavor of Star Trek in its classic sense and create something new.All of which are found in this fine episode though the execution was a little clumsy and the synthesis doesn't quite come together. Though they sure gave it the college try and pulled out all the stops, setting up a marvelous adventure where Kirk and Spock are transformed into water breathers after an accident while exploring a planet submerged beneath a global ocean. Unable to exist in a tank in sick bay for the rest of their careers the two set off into the depths to try and find a method to reverse the process.And come in contact with a civilization of aquatic humanoids living on the ocean floor, an intriguing concept handled well by the animators. Such a scenario could never have been staged during the production run of the original series and its enjoyable seeing Kirk & Spock in a truly alien environment that is at the same time quite familiar looking. The structure of the episode is also quite familiar, with a tribune council of elders, young upstart Aquans threatened with exile to the open seas for helping the two, and a marvelous giant squid beast with six foot fangs who of course turns out to be the crux of the plot's focus.So all of the elements are there but the results are still a bit stiff and uneven in part due to the scope of the episode's aspirations. This was probably one of the most complex and costly of the Animated Series episodes to produce even with James Doohan providing voice work for nearly every character other than Kirk, Spock, and Bones McCoy. It's a tour-de-force performance by Doohan, the animators, and Armen's script, which like her Original Series episodes ""Gamesters of Triskelion"" & ""The Cloud Minders"" features a strong female character who is an equal of Kirk & Spock rather than just another tidbit of alien nookie to be conquered.So it's still pretty daring stuff for Saturday morning cartoon fare and comes off well enough in relation to the rest of the Animated Series episodes, and is a unique little view of Star Trek in that 90% of the action is set underwater. And if like me you consciously prefer the funky low tech look of 1970s hand-drawn animation this is one eye popping & adventuresome little cartoon show. Even with modern digital animation techniques one would have a difficult time capturing the nuances of such a world and if the cartoon vision presented uses a short-hand approach to depicting its only due to the limitations of the form. It's supposed to look a little stiff, maybe.Which would be my only complaint about the results, though this has always been a favorite in part due to having been blessed with a box set of Alan Dean Foster's ""Star Trek Log"" novelizations of the Animated Series stories, this being one of the best of his non-expanded upon straightforward adaptations. Credit for which should go to Margaret Armen for her engaging story, which has some great little Star Trek moments in it. And represents one of the more ambitious attempts at making a functional Star Trek adventure that utilized the limitless possibilities of the animation medium. You can certainly do worse for twenty three minutes of your time, and kids who love Star Trek will of course go nuts. 6/10",6

The vessel is destroyed and Kirk and Spock go missing, only to be found later with girls and webbed hands and feet.Their lives were saved by the Aquans, an underwater species wary of land walkers.

They need venom from the sea monster to change back. They acquire this and return to normal. The younger Aquans say they'll use the technology to go back to land walking while maintaining ties with their underwater brethren.This episode is a mess. It's boring, clunky, and has so much exposition packed into it that it felt like it needed 2 hours to get everything it wanted in the plot set up for us. And even then it would be a terrible movie. Not much in the form of redeeming qualities in this episode.",1

0,"""Star Trek"" The Slaver Weapon (TV Episode 1973)","A Unique & Satisfying ""Star Trek"" Adventure!","Larry Niven's ""The Slaver Weapon"" -- adapted from his original story ""The Soft Weapon"" and re-configured into the basis of an episode from the 1973/1974 ""Star Trek: The Animated Series"" -- is one of my all time favorite installments of Star Trek, period.Of the now 45 years we have had the mythology of Star Trek as an entertainment form, regardless of what shape it took (TV show, movie, book), this is one of the most unique and rewarding, packing enough Trek and sci-fi interest into its 23 minutes to enthrall any geek. I'd actually call it a cyberpunk work, utilizing advanced fictional technologies as a plot focus and projecting a vision of the future that is cynical, unromantic, and indifferent to humans if not outright hostile. Gene Roddenberry took a chance on green-lighting this one and it paid off big time, in my opinion at any rate. Way out of proportion to what was expected of it, at any rate.The episode is also unique in that it is the only official example of ""Star Trek"" in any form before the debut of The Next Generation series in 1987 to *not* feature the presence of William Shatner's Captain James Tiberius Kirk. Which is ironic, not just because of how cool it turned out to be, but due to Shatner's well known disregard for the Animated Series, which he found to be debasing & embarrassing to participate in. So they made this one while he was off doing Shakespeare In The Park for $200 a night. Hey, gotta make a living.They picked a winner of a script for his absence too, with Niven adapting ""The Soft Weapon"" to feature Spock, Sulu, and Uhura piloting a starfleet shuttlecraft to rendezvous with the Enterprise when the Slaver Stasis Box in their possession indicates the presence of another stasis box nearby. What pray tell is a Stasis Box? Let's just say that inside of one there is no passage of time, sort of like the ultimate refrigerator except no leftover 3/4 empty bottles of salad dressing on the doors. Archaeologists had found it on a remote planet and Spock had been dispatched to collect it. Following so far? Their Box leads them to finding a 2nd one on a small ice bound planetoid ... which turns out to be a trap laid by Niven's alien species creation, the Kzinti, completely hostile eight foot tall creatures with feline characteristics who consider human meat to be a delicacy. And they want that Stasis Box & whatever might be inside, knowing very well that the Slavers -- another species created by Niven and long died out -- had weapons which could potentially devastate a whole galaxy.Wouldn't you know it but Spock's Box does indeed contain an intriguing device that shifts its appearance and function with the twist of a toggle switch. And one of the settings does prove to be for quite the formidable little Weapon of Mass Destruction, leading to a startlingly violent little climax that infamously resulted in the only loss of life during the Animated Series' run. They kill people in this one ... Far out.This was supposedly a Saturday morning cartoon show for kids, remember, airing at about 10am during its initial run on CBS when we were sitting there in our pajamas with the feets on the bottom & chowing down on the King Vitamin. I don't particularly recall seeing this episode as a kid where others did leave an impression, but it is exactly the kind of stuff I would have been fascinated by: Space ships, space suits, laser guns, hand held rocket launchers. You betcha.I will still concede that ""Yesteryear"" is the best episode from the Animated Series, and that ""Beyond The Farthest Star"" remains my single favorite episode, necessitated by the absence of Kirk from this installment. Love him or hate him, James T. Kirk was the essence of Star Trek, as nobody else really had any cosmic lessons to learn. So the absence of Kirk sort of requires this episode to be set aside when considering singling out *the* best of what the Animated Series had to offer.But by golly this one rocks! When I talk to some of my associates about watching Star Trek cartoons I'm sure the imagine me sitting here in my slippers with a bowl of Mult-Grain Cheerios and a bong, pretending that I'm 9 all over again with some stupid dumb cartoon show that you have to be stoned to appreciate as a grownup. Screw that! This is first rate Star Trek any way you slice it. That the Animated Series offered Niven the opportunity to work with Roddenberry & his talents to produce this episode was an opportunity to create something new, and this is one of the best examples of the creative team actually managing to do that. It is great science fiction, great Star Trek, and one of Saturday morning programming's finest half hours, with commercials.9/10; Alan Dead Foster expanded the story to book length form for his ""Star Trek Log Ten"" novelization, which is still in print, and Niven's short story which formed the basis can also be found with relative ease in a collection with other works. Good art leads to more art once again.",9
1,"""Star Trek"" The Slaver Weapon (TV Episode 1973)",One of the Bright Spots of the Season,"In ""The Slaver Weapon"", the Enterprise discovers a Slaver Stasis Box, a time capsule-like box left by an ancient, highly advanced race that ruled the galaxy long before the Federation's creation. Things found inside the box do not age at all. Due to active bombs being opened and killing people, only special handler can now open them. Spock, Uhura, and Sulu are in a shuttlecraft delivering this box to a handler.Spock gets a notification of another potential box being picked up nearby. It turns out to be a trap by a Kzinti crew intent upon stealing the box and using whatever is inside to regain power.We learn that the Kzinti race has been prohibited from using weapons due to the Treaty of Sirius after losing their fourth war with mankind. These Kzinti are violating the treaty as they have phasers which they use to capture the trio and steal the box.The Kzinti are carnivorous and have no respect for Vulcans or females, only communicating with Sulu. The box is opened to reveal some strange gadgetry, a shapeshifting spy device reminiscent of a James Bond movie, complete with a telescope, laser gun, and energy blocker.Spock and Sulu manage to escape and try out the device further. They find a setting with a weapon so powerful in such a small package that it's more advanced than anything Star Fleet currently has. They can't let the Kzinti get their hands on it but they still have Uhura hostage.Spock hypothesises that the spy weapon must have some type of self destruct but the two are recaptured before they can find it. While fiddling with the device, the Kzinti activate a computer inside of it which talks to them. The computer realizes the Kzinti is not it's Slaver owner and self destructs, killing the Kzinti. The trio escape back to the Enterprise. The stasis box never made it to its destination but it was too powerful for any group to currently have.This animated series has been tough sledding to get through but this episode was a very pleasant surprise! While not my favorite episode of the series (that honor goes to ""Yesteryear"") this is a close second and has the most original script of this series run. The inclusion of a new race is always fun, we get some background of humanity's history, and Spock and two lesser characters are center stage. While I love Kirk, it's nice to see someone else get the limelight for a change. Sulu is practically never heard from anymore. Here he takes the lead.It's amazing how much they were able to fit into this 20 minutes. Most episodes are terrible at this but this episode does a fine job. If there were more animated episodes like this, maybe the show would have had a longer run.",7

Some of the characters go flying through the air or do somersaults when hit by the wind or other factors. Sulu spends a lot of time on the ground as does Spock. And then there is an explosion.",5
3,"""Star Trek"" The Slaver Weapon (TV Episode 1973)",Crap...pure crap.,"I have gone through over half of the old ""Star Trek"" cartoons and am completely convinced that the average 8th grader could easily produce a better cartoon. The frame rates are pathetic--sort of like watching a slide show because there is so little movement in the characters. And, as for the characters, again, a talented 8th grader could do just as well. However, he'd also have to be a color-blind 8th grader, as the 'enemy', the Kzinti, are ridiculous looking cat-like humanoids in pink and purple jumpsuits! Yick!The entire show consists of a landing party (NO KIRK!) trying to get weapons from a dead slaver ship. This is because they don't want this high tech stuff getting into the hands of jerks--like the Kzinti. When they meet these catty creatures, there isn't much action...but I did like it when Uhura ran away and one Kzinti told the other to capture her because Human females are so smart!Overall, this is a pathetically drawn mess with barely any real plot and totally stupid characters. Really, this is an embarrassment to offer to the Trek fans...though the die-hard ones will love it, as they love anything with the Trek name on it. Others avoid at all costs.",2
0,"""Star Trek"" The Eye of the Beholder (TV Episode 1974)",One of the better cartoons of the series.,"I was surprised by this particular episode of the animated ""Star Trek"" series...it didn't suck. While the quality of the animation was horrible, as usual (and DON'T attack me for saying the obvious-- -it IS among the ugliest and worst animated TV shows ever), the story was interesting and seemed to fit into the style of the previous TV show much more than most of the animated shows.Enterprise is looking for the crew of a scientific expedition. Their ship is in orbit but the crew beamed down to a planet and haven't been heard of since. When the usual three beam down, they find a strange planet which seems artificial because it has so many different terrains and geological features in such a small area. Only when it's too late do they realize it's a zoo...and they are the new exhibits!The plot was clearly inspired by a ""Twilight Zone"" episode with a similar idea. But, the show was intelligently executed and kept my interest throughout. Now brilliant but for the cartoon series, it was a high point.",7

Kirk, Spock, and Bones beam down to find the surface littered with strange animals and landscapes. They're captured by Heffalump-looking creatures who put them in a zoo cage. This species is so advanced that it can't even understand the humans. They reunite with the missing crew and learn more about their captors.Since the unknown aliens are telepathic, Kirk uses his mind to trick them into giving him his communicator. He uses it to ask Scott for a beam up. Scotty mistakenly beams aboard one of the children of the aliens, causing a panic. Since the child isn't fully developed, Scotty is able to communicate with it and they head back down to the surface. The child explains to its parents that the humanoids are intelligent and they decide to release the crew. The crew beam back aboard and head off to space once again.This feels like a rehash of the original pilot that didn't air until later. The main difference is the captors knowledge of their captives and how intelligent they are. These aliens seem more benign than the Talosians. There are other differences but none especially worth mentioning.This episode is about average compared with the low standards of this series. The animation never improved, the scripts are typically slow, and the voice acting phoned-in and lazy.My favorite part about this is Kirk getting and at the other captain for beaming down against Star Fleet regulations even though Kirk does it all the time.",5

0,"""Star Trek"" The Jihad (TV Episode 1974)",Yikes...,I think somebody over at the animation studio mixed up the script of a He-Man episode with a Star Trek one. That's the only explanation I can come up with for why this episode could possibly exist. This is a bunch of nonsense.I usually write a brief summation of the plot with each review but this one isn't even worth it. The entire concept is extremely flawed and bizarre. Quite the way to end this first season...,1
1,"""Star Trek"" The Jihad (TV Episode 1974)","Say It With Me: ""It's Just a Saturday Morning Cartoon""","I'm not a Star Trek snob. I am, however, a fan. I'm just watching these animated things for the first time. Generally, they lack much effort from the writers. Part of it is the time limitations imposed on the episodes. You have to tell a pretty sophisticated story in about twenty minutes (if you throw out the credits). This is unfair and makes the writers jump over all kinds of exposition and foundation. The only Star Trek stuff we had when these were released were the original episodes. I would imagine the true early fans would have had a really limited understanding of the strengths and the foibles of the characters. The Klingons and the Vulcans have almost no development at this point (which is certainly made greater when ""The Next Generation"" comes about. Spock continues with that percentage thing at every turn. The chance we will be killed is 74.79 percent. Klingons are just humans with sort of a blackness about them. This story, ""Jihad,"" involves a group of diverse aliens who are trying to recover some relic that, if not found, will lead to a galactic war. Never quite figured out why. Anyway, there's my two cents worth. This episode is not very interesting to be quite honest.",4

A stupid catlike creature in an odd pink jumpsuit calls a diverse group of beings to go on a mission to find the stolen Soul of Skorr--some holy relic.

So the group of freaks (including not just Spock and Kirk but a lizard guy, a bird-man, a big green pupae and an amazonish lady who thinks Kirk is hot) goes in search of it. The problem is that there is a traitor among them and their motivations seem pretty lame.This is an average (for this series) episode. The plot is a bit silly and the characters REALLY silly.

In fact, those snobs don't like ANY of the animated Star Treks, which is sad indeed. In this episode there was excitement and danger, a perilous journey, and new aliens galore! Because it was so well done, this episode inspired me to write in the Star Trek universe. One of the best things about animation is you can create aliens that cannot be made on the regular ST shows; the bug alien, or the can alien, or bird alien in this episode. For animated Star Trek, it doesn't get much better than this! I especially like Skorr and his people, and the possibility of a interstellar jihad. Thats a wicked cool concept that really hasn't been done in ST. AAA+++",10
