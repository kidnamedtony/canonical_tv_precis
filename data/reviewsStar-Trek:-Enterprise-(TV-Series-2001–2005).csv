Meanwhile the Enterprise's command discovers that they are on Earth in 1944, and Germany has invaded the United State of America; therefore they realize that history has changed. T'Pol sends Travis and Trip in the Shuttlepod One to investigate and they are fired by airplanes. While being transported to meet the evil red-eyed Vosk, the resistance attacks the convoy and Captain Archer is captured by the group. He is arrested and stays in Alicia Travers' house in Brooklyn. In the meantime, the time traveler Daniels totally aged visits the Enterprise and explains that the timeline had been changed and he sent the Enterprise to 1944 to try to fix; otherwise there is no future for the mankind.""Storm Front: Part I"" is an engaging episode of Enterprise. The story shows history upside-down, with the battlefield in the United States of America in the World War II with the resistance acting in New York. Let's see how Captain Archer, T'Pol and the crewmembers of the Enterprise will resolve this situation. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Tempestade Temporal"" (""Temporal Storm"")",8
1,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Storm Front (TV Episode 2004)",The Enterprise vs Alien Nazis,"The final season go Enterprise kicks off with the crew realizing that, after destroying the Xindi weapon, they've been transported back in time to the WWII era. Presumed dead, Archer has somehow ended up on the surface of Earth and is captured by Germans but quickly escapes. However, the timeline is wrong. The Nazis control Washington DC thanks to the help of an alien lifeform. Archer tries to get to the bottom of this with the help of some New York gangsters who are part of the Resistance. Meanwhile, Silik is aboard Enterprise somehow and steals a shuttlepod and heads to Earth. Travis & Trip follow him and are subsequently captured. Archer finds his way back to Enterlrise and a very disfigured Daniels explains the whole situation to T'Pol and Archer. They must stop these alien Nazis from altering the timeline. There's a whole lot to unpack here. We're not easing into Season 4 but are going in full throttle with this extremely confusing plotline. It kind of makes you wonder if the show's creators knew they were in danger of cancelation and decided to ""throw the kitchen sink"" to start this season. This is the second season premiere where Archer is separated from the Enterprise (last time he went forward in time) and both times this issue has been resolved far too quickly. The premise of Archer needing to find his way back is an interesting one but when he reunites with the Enterprise in the same episode this is established, what's the point of even setting this up? Let's make it a longer plot arc! I was pleasantly surprised to see Steve Schirripa in this episode but unfortunately he's sleepwalking through his small role. I did enjoy Golden Brooks' role though. This whole Nazi alien plot isn't for me. I hope this gets resolved next episode so we can get back to what Star Trek does best: exploring space!",5
2,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Storm Front (TV Episode 2004)",Alien Nazis!,"One would have thought that after saving humanity from the Xindi at the end of season three the crew of the Enterprise might get some time to relax and get the ship repaired; no such luck however as the destruction of the weapon has sent them into the past. This isn't a past we'd recognise though; it is the middle of the second world war but the Germans have successfully invaded the eastern part of the United States with the help of a race of alien time travellers. The crew believe that Captain Archer was killed when the weapon exploded but in fact he is injured on Earth where once free from his Nazi captors he must find out why history as changed and contact the Enterprise.After the long running Xindi story arc it was nice to see something different, and while using the Nazis as a plot device is somewhat cliché it is given a nice new twist by having them in North America. I liked the fact that the Enterprise is shown battered and bruised after all it has been through rather than being in perfect condition. The one thing I wasn't so keen on was the scene where one of the Enterprise's shuttles is intercepted by US fighters over San Francisco, it was a good idea but the special effects were a bit too obvious.",8
3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Storm Front (TV Episode 2004)",I have not seen a worst episode than this one....,"I have, really, not seen a worse episode than this one! 
When a series does play with time travel it always does go baldy, with the exception of the comedy ones.
First making historical errors is soooo easy. And in American series they make tons of those? can they never get a real historian of the period they try to act into?!
Are ""Nazis"" always caricatures peoples and the USA depiction of resistance is so ridiculous. A person with fear in their belly do not think of anything else than their mission or self-preserves ion, the stupid are often dead before they can do harm to other.
Second touching at even a detail in history can change a lot millions of years later. Or you can take the inverse theory and that history is self-Healing and any change does Nothing to history that shall health/correct itself. But in any case even the worse author know he should not make paradoxes and there are many, to many in this episode of this ""B"" series.",2

And, when Archer awakens, he's in a Nazi mobile hospital!!! And, the shuttle approaching San Francisco is set upon by P-51 fighters!! Huh?!?!? Obviously this is one strange episode and it's so weird that you HOPE that this isn't a shadow of things to come. Fortunately, this and the following episode are the only Nazi ones and the reason all this occurs is interesting....though quite silly. The bottom line is that if you love ""Star Trek: Enterprise"", don't show your friends these two episodes--they'll think you're nuts. And, for fans, it IS enjoyably strange and very watchable.",7

The remaining crew thinks Archer is dead, but he is on earth, in the hands of an alien race that is in cahoots with the Nazi's who have invaded the West. Archer meets a black woman in Harlem who is friends with a bunch of gangster types. The talk to a man who gives them information about the clay faced aliens. These guys are going to mess up the time/space continuum. Trip and Travis take a shuttle to the surface and face the worst of the enemy. Meanwhile, Daniels shows up on board the Enterprise.

Daniel is alive again and tells Archer that the timeline is restored back to normal, and the Enterprise returns to two hundred years ahead.Despite the paradoxes, ""Storm Front: Part II' is a good conclusion to the last episode. The evil leader of the Temporal Cold War Vosk is destroyed and I believe that if Daniel is resuscitated, the same might have happened to Silik. The Enterprise is back to the normal period of time and ready for a new adventure. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Tempestade Temporal – Part II"" (""Temporal Storm – Part II"")",8
1,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Storm Front, Part II (TV Episode 2004)",Resetting the time line,"This second part of a two part episodes starts with Trip and Travis in the custody of the Nazi aliens and Archer back on the Enterprise along with a resistance fighter who seems remarkable calm considering she has just been beamed to a space ship. Archer manages to negotiate for the freedom of his two but soon finds out that one of them isn't who he seems; instead of Trip he finds he has rescued Silik, a Suliban temporal agent. As Salik has the same aims as Archer the two of them work together to return to the surface and destroy the time conduit being constructed by the alien Nazis.This was a decent episode with some nice action scenes. It was an enjoyable twist when the person we thought was Trip turned out to be Silik. Of course it is always nice to see Nazis having their evil plans thwarted and if they are alien Nazis so much the better.",7
2,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Storm Front, Part II (TV Episode 2004)",Hard Reset,"In the second half of this two part episode, Archer must work with Silik to destroy Vosk's time machine in order to fix the timeline. He also needs to track down Trip, still within the compound somewhere. If he can't do this in time, everything maybe lost!It seems like the show's creators are tying up loose ends by killing off Silik and ending the Temporal Cold War. Boy, do time travel episodes make my head hurt! None of this really makes any sense but I guess that they just wanted to start fresh and get all this behind them. After building up this Temporal Cold War practically all series long, it really ends in a bit of a whimper. Very lame but hey, we no longer have any through lines holding us down and this gives the writers an opportunity to explore new plots and characters. Could they have dealt with ending the Cold War better? Yes, of course, but it's shadow no longer hangs over the series. Note: Did we really need to bring Nazis into this to finish up this plot thread? Very silly... I will moss the character of Silik though.",4
3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Storm Front, Part II (TV Episode 2004)","The second part of this WWII era episode is even weirder, as Archer and Silik become allies!!","Of all the episodes of ""Star Trek: Enterprise"", this two-parter is the strangest. I am not sure if it's because the show jumped the shark or they were being really clever. All I know is that it is strange and I could see how fans might be a bit put off by this.Part one brought the Enterprise to WWII-era Earth. The Nazis, inexplicably, are being helped by aliens!! Because of this, they are kicking American butt! So why would these ugly-faced galactic dudes be on Earth and why would they help the Nazis?! If that isn't strange enough, you'll see Archer team up with mobsters to help defeat them...as well as Silik!!! If you remember, Silik is the time traveler who battles the good time cops! To see how all this works together and actually makes sense, see the show. It's well done but perhaps too goofy for my taste.",7
4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Storm Front, Part II (TV Episode 2004)","Why do you do this to me, Enterprise?","After two years of being as bad or worse than ""Voyager"", Season 3 of Enterprise pulls the Xindi story arc, a full season set entirely upon the Enterprise going into the Delphic Expanse, trying to contact and stop a race called Xindi from destroying Earth---a race that is surprisingly NOT all evil wicked villains, even the stereotypical bad guys, the Reptilians and Insectoids, though they are clearly the more antagonistic of the five sub-species.Then season 3 ends with the big resolution payoff and... ALIEN Nazis! And before I can bawl with laughter at the stupid, they put forth a compelling storyline, intriguing characters, and deep layers to the story, including the Suliban.In the first episode, we are introduced to an alternate timeline, where Nazi Germany has invaded and occupies the eastern coast of the United States, and characters like the stereotypical 30s gangster are now insurgent freedom fighters. A wicked-looking alien race is apparently helping the Nazis, giving them technology and military assistance in exchange for supplies and resources to build a Conduit, to send them forward in time to where they came from.These aliens apparently went back in time with the intention of starting an actual war from the Temporal Cold War and changing the timeline.And yet in completely un-Star Trek Enterprise fashion, these ""wicked-looking"" aliens are not just outright bad guys. Even though they share in common with the Nazis beliefs of racial superiority and purity, they're willing to help Enterprise, and even revert the changes to the timeline in exchange for helping these aliens.And yet the layers of politics and diplomacy with the aliens, the Enterprise crew, the Suliban Silik, the future-Federation, are so complex (for Star Trek post-DS9) that Daniels' faction of the Temporal Cold War helps the Suliban, and is considered to be tyrannic by the evil-looking aliens for their constant interference and meddling in the timeline, and Archer ends up helping Silik after an agreement with the aliens falls through.Season 3 was a huge step up for Enterprise, not just in being ""not as awful as Voyager"" territory, but even coming close to matching the average TNG episode in terms of quality. Hard decisions were made (""Damage"" was incredibly blunt in this regard, with Archer forced to attack and loot an unarmed civilian vessel in order to fix his warp engine, stranding these people 3 years from their homeworld), character development evolved even the stupidest, hackneyed characters like Trip ""Catfish"" Tucker, and Archer became so involved in his mission and so desperate, he becomes prome to fits of anger, he would resort to torture, threats, and as mentioned above, attacking civilians for a greater good.This is no longer ""Voyager""-style Star Trek, where strict adherence to the Prime Directive (or smug referencing of a future potential Prime Directive) is maintained even at the cost of lives and moral decency, with a technobabble resolution or hackneyed plot device to save the crew from making any realistically harsh decisions.I hope season 4 continues to better itself in this regard. If so, it'd be an immense tragedy that Enterprise fell to cancellation so soon. The first two seasons of Enterprise were truly terrible, however, and apparently they were the deathknell of the series entirely.Which is a tragedy, given that ""Star Trek The Next Generation"" had two full seasons of awful episodes before Season 3's vast improvements saved the series and even elevated it to iconic status, or Voyager having all seven seasons of mediocrity continue unabated.",10
5,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Storm Front, Part II (TV Episode 2004)",Finally Some Rest,I appreciated that this set of events was handled in two episodes. I don't know if I had the staying power to try for 24 episodes to handle the Nazis. Archer must enlist the Suliban commander and the earth people to attack the time machine being built. One problem with the Suliban is their shape shifting which added an element of doubt over who and what was real. The whole business with a bunch of gangsters was a bit absurd. They were able to overcome the Nazi's with nary a casualty. I wasn't as engaged in this one because the villains weren't as well developed.,8
6,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Storm Front, Part II (TV Episode 2004)","bad history, big plot holes, but entertaining","Clearly, the writers of the series have issues with their knowledge of history and their ""temporal cold war"" timeline play. Assassinating V. I. Lenin before the 1917 Bolshevik revolution would probably not have stopped it, and even if it had, precluding the Bolshevik Revolution would likely have drastically altered the end of World War I to Germany's disadvantage, not given Germany an advantage in World War II. Even assuming their treatment to be correct history, however, the writers still failed to explain how the timeline damage done by that particular event (an event that happened 28 years before the time of the episode) was reversed by killing one Nazi commander and a dozen aliens. The only solution I can think of requires about 5 different time-related paradoxes. Still, it made for a very entertaining few episodes, despite the horrific flaws in writing.",6
0,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Home (TV Episode 2004)",It Is Good to Be Home,"The Enterprise returns to Earth and Captain Archer and his crew are welcomed as heroes. In his speech, Archer recalls the twenty-seven crew- members that died along their mission. While the Enterprise is in maintenance, Captain Archer is invited for a debriefing for the Starfleet high command and the crew is released on vacation. T'Pol invites Tucker to visit Vulcan and stay in her home; however she finds that her mother T'Les was forced to an early retirement since the Vulcans blame T'Pol for the incident in the Vulcan sanctuary of P'Jem. Further, the only chance her mother has to return to her active life is through the wedding of T'Pol with her former fiancé Koss, whose father is very influent. Meanwhile Dr. Phlox goes to Earth with Lieutenant Reed and Ensign Maywheather and while drinking in a bar, he finds the prejudice of earthlings with aliens after the Xindi attack. In the debriefing, Archer feels offended by the Vulcan Ambassador Soval and while the report is on hold, he climbs the mountains with his old friend Captain Erika Hernandez to calm down.""Home"" is a very emotional episode of ""Enterprise"" where the best part is the series of revelations disclosed to Tucker and T'Pol in Vulcan and the climax is certainly the wedding of T'Pol. The analogy of the September, 11th with the Xindi attack and the consequent prejudice with aliens is very clear and is the strongest part of this episode. The effect of the assignment to the Expansion to Captain Archer is less engaging than it should be, but is not bad at all. In the end, it sounds ironic the salute of Captain Archer in the beginning telling that it is good to be home since most of the crew-members are feeling outcast indeed. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Lar"" (""Home"")",9
1,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Home (TV Episode 2004)",Back to Earth... and all is not well,"Finally back on Earth and at the correct time the crew of the Enterprise receive an official heroes welcome, however once the pleasantries are over things don't go so well, when Dr Phlox accompanies Malcolm and Travis to a bar he finds himself being abused for being an alien, Captain Archer finds himself in front of an enquiry over an indecent which took place some time before and when T'Pol returns to Vulcan with Trip she learns that her mother has lost her job due to T'Pol's involvement in exposing a Vulcan spying system hidden in a Vulcan sanctuary... she learns that the only way to help her mother is to marry a fiancé who she has no interest in.This was an interesting episode which served almost entirely to introduce us to the new situation the crew find themselves in rather than to give the viewer a single story. By the end of the episode none of the issues was resolved, this may sound unsatisfactory but I found it to be a good character driven episode which left me keen to learn how the various plot strands will work out.",8
2,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Home (TV Episode 2004)",Guess who's coming to dinner....Vulcan style.,"While ""Home"" is an interesting episode, it's also a very 'small' one-- where very little actually happens during most of the episode. There are no villains, no explosions, no serious problems---just the crew having some shore leave now that they've saved the Earth. Much of the show illustrates how stupid people are in the 23rd century--both on Earth and on Vulcan. After some partying to celebrate their return, Phlox is treated like crap by some xenophobic jerks. And, on Vulcan, Tripp accompanies T'Pol and T'Pol's mommy makes him feel about as welcome as herpes--at least initially. Again, xenophobia has reared its ugly head in these pre-Federation days. As for the Captain, he's got a lot of self-doubts. The only really important occurrence is at the end...and it happens to T'Pol. Overall, an interesting and mostly uneventful show.",7
3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Home (TV Episode 2004)",They Don't Understand!,"If you've ever done something that was emotionally and physically involving and suffered greatly to achieve an end and succeeded, only to return to your previous life, you can appreciate this episode. There is no way the earth people and the Vulcans can begin to appreciate the gravity of such accomplishments. There are two things at work. First of all, there is the adulation and hero worship from the fickle public. Secondly, there is xenophobia and bigotry, directed at anyone who does not fit the status quo. Archer is reeling from having to be a person he never imagined in order to fulfill his mission. He had to sell out his morality at times. He had to kill. T'Pol loves Trip but Vulcans have their own rules and traditions and he is out of place on their planet. It is here that the realities become so overwhelming. I thought this was a good, necessary episode, even if there was no combat or special effects to dominate the screen.",8
4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Home (TV Episode 2004)",The disillusionment of space travel,"In the tradition of TNG's ""Family"" this episode is one about characters. Following the end to the Xindi arc that dominated season three and the previous two episodes that put an end to the temporal cold war arc, our crew returns home for a warm happy reception, but after everything that has happened in the last year it is a little bittersweet for the heroes Enterprise.Archer's storyline is what is really enjoyable about ""Home"", and we get to see a different captain than the ones that came before (after?). Here we get to see what the last year and Archer's entire time as captain has done to him. He is suffering from a state of disillusionment. He went forward to explore strange new worlds with a wild eyed optimism and excitement and now after discovering all the villainous species out there the spirit of adventure he once possessed has now been replaced with a hardened military man who sees enemies everywhere he turns. The other main storyline is satisfactory and concerns the budding romance between Trip and T'Pol. This one also has a storyline I wish would have been an entire episode unto itself and that concerns the growing xenophobia of the people on Earth following the attack by the Xindi. Fortunately, that story arc comes to fruition a little later on in the season. ""Home"" is not an amazing episode by any means. There are not any amazing battles or rich moral drama. It is all about the characters and this one does what it sets out to do and offers us a unique glimpse into our crew.",8
5,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Home (TV Episode 2004)",Back to Modern Earth,"In ""Home"", the Enterprise finally arrives back to Earth (during their own time period) and the crew attempt to reacclimate themselves. Archer grows frustrated during a debriefing when the Vulcan ambassador questions his methods involving destroying the Vulcan ship Seleya in the Expanse. He goes mountain climbing with an old flame. T'Pol takes Trip to Vulcan with her. When T'Pol's ex-fiancée promises to reinstate T'Les (T'Pol's mother) to her old position if T'Pol marries him, T'Pol must decide between Trip and family. Reed and Travis take Dr. Phlox out to a bar but a new wave of Xindi-caused xenophobia creates issues for Phlox on Earth. We end the episode with T'Pol on the altar. This was a nice change of pace from all the war and fighting we got in Season 3. Besides the bar brawl and a nightmare that Archer has, this episode is entirely focused on character development and interactions. Trip & T'Pol's relationship is at a crossroads and the ""will they/won't they"" dynamic appears to be something that will continue onward into Season 4. The xenophobia on Earth is an interesting subplot that could lead to further development in Season 4. Even though the Xindi have been defeated, many still dislike Star Fleet's mission of exploring the universe and stirring up trouble. Archer seems like a more cynical, changed man since when he first began his mission. When he gets back to exploring will his demeanor change or will he turn into a gruff, pessimistic Captain?",7
6,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Home (TV Episode 2004)",Great!,"This is another relatively ""businesslike"" episode of ""Enterprise"" following hard on the heels of the very dynamic if slightly questionable kickoff and follow-through from Season 3 with ""Storm Front"". In a sense, then, ""Home"" provides the genuine start of the 4th (and regrettably final) season. And here the makers again show how much good work they can do with relatively straightforward, if very worthwhile storylines. Earth has been holding its breath for a long while, and naturally treats the returning ""Enterprise"" crew as heroes, but the latter don't fully know how to react to a time of peace and opportunity that cannot erase their memories of fight, struggle, destruction and the odd morally-dubious decision. And there are also more dark clouds, as Xindi-promoted xenophobia reappears on Earth and issues thought resolved long ago have to be re-addressed afresh. Vulcan-Earth matters also gain further exploration, and make progress - on both planets, since T'Pol takes Trip with her as she also goes ""home"". In these contexts, there is a great deal of thoughtful and well thought-out content here, the only pity of it being lack of time to explore the issues quite as well as might have been the case, as well as an emotionally dramatic (and far too abrupt) episode ending that leads into an apparently entirely-unconnected 4th episode, and thus leaves true closure far away! Odd, in a way, and a little bit of sublime-to-ridiculous presentation work that builds much and then leaves feelings dissipated.But the ""core"" of the episode as such offers plenty.",9

The Starfleet command assigns Captain Archer to capture the Augments that they believe that have been created by the imprisoned genetic engineer Dr. Soong to prevent the imminent war. The Enterprise heads to the borderland with Dr. Soong on board but nine crew-member including T'Pol are captured by the Orion Syndicate to be sold in a market slave. Captain Archer and Dr. Soong are beamed to the location to rescue the group. Meanwhile, there is a dispute for the leadership of the Augments between the leader Raakin and the ambitious and rebel Malik. ""Borderline"" is an engaging episode of Enterprise and it is great to see Brent ""Data"" Spinner in the role of a dangerous villain that is a sort of combination of Hitler and God.

1,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Borderland (TV Episode 2004)",Genetically enhanced supermen with mullets,"This story seems a welcome guess appearance from Brent Spiner, best known for playing Data in ""The Next Generation"", here he plays Dr. Arik Soong an ancestor of Data's creator. Arik Soong is not one of the good guys; he is a genetic engineer who has created a group of genetically modified super humans called ""augments"". While he has been in prison his augments have grown up and have captured a Klingon ship for reasons which aren't initially known. The Klingons are understandable less than happy about this and it looks as if they may attack Earth in retaliation. In order to prevent this Archer and the crew of the Enterprise are dispatched to find the Augments with the help of Dr Soong. As they travel through the borderlands where the Augment's attack took place they are ambushed by Orion slave traders who beam several crew members off the ship to be sold for slaves. Archer and Soong go to the slave market to try to free the crew members during this mission Soong tries to escape but us recaptured.., only to be freed once again when the Augments come to the Enterprise.This was a pretty good story which as well as seeing a guest appearance from Brent Spiner saw a brief appearance of an Orion slave girl... the ""green girl"" from the original Star Trek. The only thing I wasn't so keen on was the appearance of the Augments; if Soong created a race a super humans surely he could have given them better taste... mullets and clothes that make them look like extras in Mad Max don't look impressive.",8
2,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Borderland (TV Episode 2004)",Excellent Opening to an Excellent Trilogy,"Star Trek: Enterprise's Augments trilogy is a highlight in the many episodes of Star Trek. The three Episodes ""Boarderland"", ""Cold Station 12"" and ""The Augments"" are among my all-time favorites. The trilogy combines 2 elements of lore that fans will love: The Eugenics Wars and Brent Spiner. Spiner steals the show in all three episodes. Basic plot of this episode: A group of genetically enhanced humans left over from the Eugenics Wars take over a Klingon ship. With war looming over the horizon, the STARSHIP ENTERPRISE takes Aurik Soong (Brent Spiner), the man who activated the embryos of these humans, to try and stop them.If you're new to Star Trek, definitely catch this trilogy first",

However, they are willing to let him out of prison, at least temporarily, because some of Soong's 'children' have grown into psychopaths who murdered a Klingon crew and stole their ship. The big question is why would Soony help them?!On the way to apparently get these renegades, pirates from Orion kidnap a bunch of crew from Enterprise and Archer goes with Soong to the Orion home world to rescue them. Again, you wonder why they trust Soong. And, after Soony does EXACTLY what the audience expects, the Captain and his crew seem pretty stupid--like they have no plan or idea what to do.While this episode is interesting, the stupidity of the Enterprise crew makes this all seem a bit contrived and disappointing. As a result, it's all very weak.",7

5,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Borderland (TV Episode 2004)",Star trek and other universes plots.,Just saw this episode and it got me thinking. Star trek is incredible when it comes to combining different shows. On Gene Roddenberrys Andromeda the human have allied them selves with the betraying kind nichians. Just could not help combing them with the genetic advanced human in this episode. And when the leader of the G.A gang quotes a philosopher Nichan. I just cant help to see a resemblance. And in S.T first contact the trivia say there is a scene where the millennium falcon from Star wars helps the Enterprise against the Borg. Could star trek be just the beginning of Andromeda.

Soong leads them into the Borderland, a contested area of space between the Klingon Empire and the Orion Syndicate. The Enterprise is attacked by the Orions. A group of crew members, including T'Pol, are captured and taken to a slave market. Archer and Soong must head there and attempt to take the crew back. This episode was a lot of fun and had a real ""Star Trek feel"" to it, reminiscent of older shows. All the different slaves and slave traders species we see at the Orion slave market give it a real sci-fi feel. The inclusion of Brent Spiner was exciting and unexpected. His ""scienctific progress before anything else"" mantra is classic evil scientist reasoning.This looks like it could turn into a very exciting plot line moving forward.",8

This was because one of the Show Creators, Braga, was stuck forever in a Season 7 Next Generation Temporal Causality Loop.We all loved Star Terk Next Gen, and some of us even liked Season 7 - I Know Brent did, but many people DON'T. Why? Because of Brannon Braga. I personally liked the guy's ideas, but he could never really move on from that High Point. As Troi tells Mr Barclay in ""The Nth Degree"" - ""We always have that one time in our lives where we surpass ourselves- The Trick is leaning how to live after that."" - But Braga, who did great as a writer most of the time, could not move away from that Season 7 Next Gen dynamic - And when he tried, what did he do? He destroyed the best Trek Ship ever- When we KNEW that the Enterprise D was to appear in the Future- Per both Next Gen and Voyager canon.Now, it is not that Temporal Causality Loops are bad. But Braga would always return the universe to it's original state. Except for the Voyager Arc, ""The Year of Hell"" - He actually kept the changes, which was an excuse tor Janeway to lose that lousy ""Bun"" hairdo. Actually, this was the only major change in the time-line that was carried over - This was done one time more, earlier in the series, with Kes, she has Short Pixie hair in the beginning of one 'sode, then long beautiful blonde hair after.So, Braga will change time-lines, IF it only has to do with Hair, or maybe, Uniforms or Com Badges.Stet? OK, so what have we here? AUGMENTS. Funny, neither Khan Noonian Singh nor Dr Julian Subatoy Bashir were ever referred to that way. Hmph. But then again, we have Paul Atreides aka Alec Newman - With A MULLET - With one other guy licking the Arses of a WHOLE ship of Klingons. A Bird of Prey, even.It's not that I never liked the effects of Enterprise - It was the whole DS9 crew, Marvin Rush, Dan Curry, Mike Okuda and Rick Sternbach maybe, it all LOOKED great.But this is supposed to be a more primitive time than TNG DS9 and VOY. Starfleet didn't use PADDS back then, they used a large surface with a Stylus.Plus, the Orion Syndicate. Don't know if they existed back then, BUT, it is a good idea, but they kidnapped half of the NX01 crew TOO QUICKLY. Maybe it is because these eps are only 41 Minutes long- Very short compared to TOS which was always 50 minutes, and TNG/Nine/Voy which was always 45 minutes. However, we DID get to see the selling of an Orion Slave Girl. But we know from Canon, Orion Slave Girls DID NOT wear compulsory gadgets on their necks to control them- We were taught THEY controlled MEN.But there was this one HUGE Orion guy, he lifted up T'Pal as if she were a kitten! I loved that she kicks this guy in the Groin and he comes tumbling WAY down.There were a lot of things I liked about this, ergo, the 8 rating. I love the Effects, of which there are a LOT in this series. I loved the Wide Screen aspect Ratio- Babylon 5 broadcast every episode in 16/9 - Why couldn't TREK do this? It depresses me to this day.Well, this Gang of Mulleted Intergalactic Hoodlums, led by Alec after he kills his way to the top, was not really ""made"" by Arik Soong - Soong merely found the Embryos, so as ""bad"" as they were, they were built that way. Newman was a good choice for Male Mullethead, but this story has a chick that Newman and another Alpha Male are fighting over- Sorry, but I DO NOT see anyone fighting over the Skag from these eps. Sorry, Nope, Shudder and Ugh. Shudder-Brrr. These Kids don't even look as dangerous as the Gang that lives down the street from me, they appear to be a Quasi Military Cadre of Ugly Kids.Spiner brings this episode down to reality level, his performance is actually great.We also get to see ""Martok"" again - Or at least the same Actor once again in great Klingon makeup, JG Hertzger, who seems to be one of the High Council. The Klingons in Ent were done well, but WHEN did they ever do away with their Brow Ridges? Maybe that was an Ent Ep that was going to be made, before Brannon caused this series to end prematurely.",8
8,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Borderland (TV Episode 2004)",A Little Too Sadistic,"This episode was a little too sadistic and simplistic for my tastes. This is supposed to be Star Trek. We know the augments are bad. We don't need to see people beaten and tortured and killed with pathogens. I agree with the reviewer who stated that the humans were stupid here. Wasn't really believable to me. This just seemed to be a setup for later episodes. Hopefully, the next episode gets better. Writing this simplistic does not seem very creative to me. Augments bad. All powerful. Humans unable to stop them. For good measure, lets also kill the augment who did not get all the enhancements. No nuance to the writing. Not one of the better Star Trek Enterprise episodes in my opinion. I was grateful it ended and would not it watch again.",1

Malik has frictions with his ""father"" Dr. Soong in the dispute of the leadership of the Augments. Archer, Dr. Phlox and a small crew are beamed to the station to rescue the prisoners and the tension between humans and Augments increases; then the evil Malik releases lethal pathogens in the station.

Soong doesn't want to hurt anybody but Malik has no such worries and is happy to kill anybody who doesn't share his 'perfection'. In order to find where Soong might be he heads to his former base where he finds Smike, an Augment who had been banished by the others as he hadn't acquired the superior abilities of the others. As they near CS12 Soong tells Archer to back off or he will execute the head of the establishment; Archer agrees but just before they are out of transporter range he leads an away team on a raid against Soong and his Augments. This doesn't go well though and Soong escapes with the embryos setting us up for the third and final part of this three episode story.While the regular cast did a good job the episode was stolen by Brent Spiner who was fantastic as Soong, even though Soong is obviously the villain of the episode Spiner's portrayal of him was sympathetic in a way which meant he wasn't just a typically evil cartoon villain. The Augments were far less sympathetic, especially mullet-haired leader Malik who is a little too keen to kill people.",8
2,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Cold Station 12 (TV Episode 2004)",I have an even better idea. I'm going to place him in an easily escapable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death.,"The above quote is from Dr. Evil in the first Austin Powers movie. It's appropriate because this was funny in a comedy...it is NOT good when it's in a sci-fi drama like ""Star Trek: Enterprise! This is the reason I see this as a particularly weak episode.This is a follow-up to the prior episode where Dr. Soong has created a group of augments--humans with heightened physical and intellectual powers but lacking in conscience. In the previous one, Captain Archer STUPIDLY allowed Soong to escape custody (a major weakness in this first episode). Now in part two, Soong and his 'children' (the augments) go in search of a veritable army of augments Soong wishes to incubate. To do this, they take over a medical research station. Archer and his crew arrive but seem pathetically unable to stop them--again because Archer behaves like a wienie.When the episode begins, the completely amoral and nasty leader of the augments has every reason to kill Archer. However, instead of just phasering his face (and he IS holding a phaser), he gives it to his bud and begins fighting with Archer. What a dumb cliché! Again, however, he could have just squished Archer's head. Instead, he beats him up and leaves him with SOME chance of escape...like Dr. Evil!! All in all this show has too many clichés and weak plot elements--and it SHOULD have been much better given the idea.",5

The trilogy combines 2 elements of lore that fans will love: The Eugenics Wars and Brent Spiner. Spiner steals the show in all three episodes. Basic plot of this episode: With Aurik Soong (Brent Spiner) now allied with the Augments he helped create, can the crew of the STARSHIP ENTERPRISE save the day before war with the Klingon Empire becomes inevitable?

4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Cold Station 12 (TV Episode 2004)",Bond Villain-esque Ending,"In ""Cold Station 12"", the Augments infiltrate the facility holding the embryos of their unborn brethren using a hijacked Denobulan ship. The Enterprise pursues them with the help of Smike, a ""handicapped"" Augment who had been left behind by his brothers and sisters. Soong and the Augments take the medical staff aboard the facility hostage as they attempt to steal the embryos and leave the station. Archer and the gang transport in and are quickly captured. The Augments leave everyone for dead and they escape to warp as the episode ends.Brent Spiner plays the role of Soong ""the misunderstood genius who is attempting to better society but his logic if flawed"" and he doed it well. His performance is hammy but I think the character needs this against the dark seriousness of the Augments whose almost sadistic approach to violence make them a menacing villain. Despite good character development, the plot leaves some to be desired. This episode falls victim to the Bond villain trap trope of leaving the hero(es) to die an overly complex death instead of just taking care of it efficiently. There's no reason to give Archer and the others a way out but Malik surely does by releasing all the diseases but on a 5 minute time delay. It felt unbecoming of the hyper-intelligent Augments to make such a mistake.I really enjoyed the performance of Richard Riehle as Dr. Lucas. He's the best part of this episode in his bit role. He acts all tough allowing his colleague to die instead of giving up the authorization codes but quickly crumbles when they threaten his buddy Phlox. Sometimes you just have to find the right leverage to make people cast aside their ideals.",6

But Mullet-Khan-Boy and his gang of ugly kids bust through NX01's security, kicks a bunch of Ent's Crew Arses, then ""Proves"" to Archer that normal Hoomans are genetically inept.Ya know, there are two goals: The Goal of the Augments are to get the Foog away from the Hoomans, and the goal of Archer is to never give up chasing them. Kinda dumb, but hey that's the Prime Directive for ya. But ya know what else? ""Augments"" is not a good word for these Genetic BRATS. A better word, would be ""Arguments"" - Because that's what they do, they argue with each other, With Dr Soong, with Archer. They are a bunch of Squabbling Testosterone driven, Pimply Punks.So now, Soong brings these pukes to Cold Station 12, and Dr Phlox has a buddy there. Well, here we have this year's excuse for using 24th century tech phrases: Dr Flox's race is more medically advanced than ANY other Race ever shown in any trek show, ever.Funny, where were they at Cor Corolli IV? The Phylox Plague? Also they should have been around in TNG S2E1 where the D is transporting all of those Plasma Plague samples.Put Brats into a Medical Cold Storage, and it is a recipe for at least one hideous death, and of course, as predicted it happened.So The GenBrats release ALL of the Toxins - Archer gets the Cold Station crew safe in one sealed area, but he has to turn on some Tech Pumps, so he himself is trapped. Thank Ghod the Good Ole NX01 shows up just in time to burn a hole in the dome, releasing Archer into Space, and then transporting him back to the Ent.Good thing the Ent's Transporters work many times faster than TNG/DS9/Voy transporters.

He is doubting Soong and the others are getting nervous. He kills one of the men in the facility where the embryos are being stored in the most hideous way. They need a code and are trying to extort information from the head of the facility. They will stop at nothing. These guys are really great villains because they have no redeeming qualities.

The scientists ask to return to disinfect the station while the Enterprise chases the Bird of Prey. When Malik discovers the pacific intentions of Dr. Soong, he leads a mutiny and imprisons his ""father"" in his quarters. Then he plots to bomb a Klingon colony with the pathogens to provoke a war to distract the Starfleet. ""The Augments"" is a great conclusion to the story of The Augments. Brent Spiner is fantastic in the role of a dreamer and his character is finally convinced by Captain Archer that superior ability breeds superior ambition.

1,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" The Augments (TV Episode 2004)",Good conclusion to a three part story,"This episode concludes the three part story about Doctor Soong and the Augments. Having fled CS12 with the remaining Augment embryos and a large stock of biological weapons they head deep into Klingon territory where Dr Soong plans to go to a planet hidden in a nebula where the embryos can be grown. Malik however has other ideas; he plans to use the bio-weapons to attack a Klingon settlement hoping to trigger a war between the Klingons and Earth. Soong objects but finds himself locked in his quarters he is helped by another Augment and escapes in an escape pod. He is picked up by the Enterprise and convinces them that he is willing to help them catch the Augments.As in the previous two parts this episode was stolen by Brent Spiner who excelled as Doctor Soong, a role that gave in the opportunity to show he has an emotional acting range he obviously couldn't show when playing Data in 'The Next Generation'. Talking of Data it was nice to hear Soong musing about creating androids rather than working on genetic engineering. The story had a good conclusion which showed that Malik was clearly psychotic, happy to kill fellow augments as well as wanting to wipe out a colony and start a war. One minor criticism though; I'm not sure it was really necessary for female Augment Persis to be wearing only a skimpy top and knickers when she fights Malik, it seemed like blatant fan service.",8

Are his only possible allies his current worst enemies? Finally, can the STARSHIP ENTERPRISE save the day and avert a major war?If you're new to Star Trek, definitely catch this trilogy first",
3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" The Augments (TV Episode 2004)",Third Part of Trilogy Falls Apart,"In ""The Augments"", we arrive at the conclusion of this trilogy's story arc. The Augments are attempting to release a bio-weapon on a Klingon colony in order to incite a war between the Klingons & humans. The Enterprise must stop them to prevent an all out bloodbath. The Augments, led by Malik, perform a mutiny against their creator Dr. Soong. Soong escapes and assists the Enterprise in stopping the Augments, destroying his creations in the process. Soong ends the episode by heading back into prison for his crimes. He considers alternatives to genetically-enhanced humans.This story had real potential of being an exciting trilogy. The build up in the first two episodes was done competently enough to really bring some stakes to the finale. But everything comes tumbling down in this one as it ends very flatly.Besides the predictable ending, this episode has a lot of issues. I do not understand how Malik could have possibly A) survived the Bird-of-Prey explosion B) made it to the Enterprise and C) gotten aboard undetected. I was so thrown off by the whole thing that I asuumed that it was a Soong dream sequence. I thought ""he must be having a nightmare about his dead son"". But no, we cut away and it turns out all that actually happened. I almost lost my mind.There are other things about this trilogy that I let slide up to this point that I ignored because I was enjoying the ride but, alas, no longer... The Augments' outfits are terrible. Why would they dress in this Mad Max aesthetic? Also their relationships are very strange. They regard themselves as siblings and yet Malik & Persis have a sexual relationship. I suppose when there are only 20 or so of you this is an unfortunate necessity to your kind's existence but if they are formed artificially in embryonic form, why do they need to be sexualized at all?I also still have no idea how the Grappler successfully disabled the Klingon ship. That whole sequence was a mystery to me. And that ending with Star Trek winking to the camera about Soong starting the creation of Data. We get it! I wanted to throw up. That's how hard Star Trek was elbowing us in the stomach with that reference. I enjoy these multiple episode story arcs but when you build up to something without any solid payoff, it really makes the entire ride feel a bit useless.",4
4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" The Augments (TV Episode 2004)",Parts 1 and 2 were unfortunately weak...what about the finale?,"The Dr. Soong trilogy from ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" had a lot of promise. Too bad that plot problems make parts 1 and 2 pretty clichéd and annoying. Is this third, and final, episode any better?Unfortunately, episode three is also filled with odd plot holes which should have been filled. First, the stolen Klingon ship is full of evil, psychotic super-humans who have already murdered and show a STRONG desire to rule the galaxy--and Enterprise has a chance to blow up the ship, they contact these augments and let them take the first shot?! Second, when they are just about to blow up the augment's stolen ship, the augments panic and throw a prisoner onto an escape pod and jettison it--and Enterprise abandons their mission to save the single person in the pod--allowing the psychos to escape! All in all, the humans seem like real potato-heads when dealing with this super- serious threat to mankind. And what is the result? Yup, Malik takes control of the ship away from Soong and plans on a little genocide--releasing a deadly planet-killing virus onto a Klingon colony in order to provoke galactic war! Hello, Captain Archer...think maybe you should have killed these freaks when you had a chance?!?!On the positive side, lovers of ""Paradise Lost"" will appreciate the ending! Otherwise a neat idea hindered by indifferent writing.",5
5,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" The Augments (TV Episode 2004)","The ""Arguments""","Despite my complaints against Ent as a Show, these Three Eps are one of the better offerings of the series, but there is still something artificial when watching this series.Because, the special Effects are many times better than in all of the 90's Treks, but the Scenes on the Bridge, in Waiting Rooms, on Sets, there is some quality that disturbs me, it's like you can tell for the first time, that these are actors acting and Playing on a Set. Maybe it was the way the HD was filmed. Watching TOS, the Movies of the 80's - TNG, DS9 - It always FELT real, it always LOOKED real. But here, some artificial, forced quality exists.The more I explore Enterprise, the better I will understand why this is. I know how TNG and DS9 were filmed, but this show is almost virtually completely CGI'd - Which is great for Space but not so great for the scenes with People.After escaping Cold Station 12, the ""Arguments"" - I call these kids ""The Arguments"" because that is all they do, they argue with themselves, with Soong, and with Everyone else- The ARGUMENTS are now in Klingon Space.Which is no problem for them, as they can fake any Klingon ships out with fake Klingonese. But the NX01, this is a Big Problem. A Big Problem fixed by using a common solution used in too many DS9 Eps and Voyager Eps. The NX01 ""copies the warp signature of the Klingon Ships"" and this gets them into Klingon Space, Scott Free, for a while.But then the Mullet Kids pull out another 24th century Conundrum - They do some 24th century Fiddling with their Warp signature, and are totally CLOAKED. Too Bad the Klingons never see this and copy it, eh?Alec Newman becomes fed up with Soong and wants to kill him now. So once again he takes over the Ship except for one person. The One Person helps Soong get away.But after Alec has sex with this person, he figures out they she let Soong loose so he kills her as well.Soong helps Ent kill the Bird of Prey and prevents a genetic bomb from blowing up over a Klingon Planet - Thus saving Starfleet from starting another war with Klingons - For the time being.But somehow, Alec Newman either JUMPS through space onto the Ent, or beamed himself over in the last second - He tries to kill Soong again.But this time, he can't dodge Archer's Laser, and a huge hole is drilled through his gut.I hope they saved his blood, so they cold use it to bring people back to life 100 years later... But this will not happen until ""Into Darkness""And Arik Soong, back in his cell, decides to drop BioEngineering, and pick up - Robotics.So, one of these days, he'll get let out of the hoosegow, and he'll have a few kids who eventually will make DATA.Regardless of my scathing comments, I actually enjoyed this last installment, which Geordi (Levar Burton) directed.I have always thought, making a show that goes BACK to the beginnings of Starfleet and The Federation was not the right kind of show for the times - Three Shows had been made about a future Way beyond that.But Braga treated the whole Enterprise series as IF it were The Next Generation.It's not that I don't enjoy watching some of this show, but I always set this show aside - It is NOT canon. Neither are the two new JJ Abrams films, but the reason for that is that Canon was CHANGED- Because when JJ does a Time Paradox, things get changed and they STAY that way.But the whole series of Enterprise describes a ""Past"" for Star Trek, Original Series- A ""Past"" that does not Jibe with the Future of that ""Universe"" or ""Timeline"" - So, I can enjoy it, if it is another Alternate Timeline of Trek. But I cannot enjoy it as a Past History of Trek, because it is not.Or Maybe Nero's Pollution of the Timeline in 2009's Trek film, has ripples gong back even to this series. This is the ONLY way I can enjoy this series at all.Gene had a simple ""gauge"" for Stories, Scripts, Ideas, races, events: ""Is it Star Trek?"" In Enterprise Star Trek? That is the question you have to answer yourself, because I won't do it for you, I can only do it for myself.",8
6,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" The Augments (TV Episode 2004)",Points off for the cheap Wrath of Khan ripoff at the end,"The entire three-part story arc involving the augments had potential, yet I appear to have overestimated Enterprise after the stellar season 3 and season 4 openers. It was subpar, though clearly not as awful as the style of writing and storytelling in seasons 1-2.Still, the plot involving Dr. Soong and the Augments is just painfully predictable. There's the group of genetically-engineered superhumans who are apparently all siblings, raised by Dr. Soong for ten years, and then spent ten years raising themselves when he was caught and imprisoned. Now they appear, as adults, and attempt to seek freedom by stealing a Klingon Bird of Prey.This, unfortunately, causes an incident, as Humans were involved, and the Klingons, this still being Enterprise, are far more stupid than they were in the TNG era, and so Archer has to take Soong and stop the Augments.This was spread across three episodes, including a side-track to the Orion Syndicate where Enterprise crewmembers are stolen and sold as slaves, only to be rescued by Archer. This took up the ENTIRE first episode, along with side-longs to the Augments.The Augment dynamic is cliché' and obvious. There's the tyrannic leader of the group who is betrayed and overtaken by his brother, who becomes even more tyrannic, while taking the brother's girlfriend as his own. When the Father (Dr. Soong) returns, he is disappointed with the leader, and the leader is disappointed at the Father for being so soft, leading eventually to the Father being deposed, escaping, and helping Archer to stop his children, while the leader kills the girlfriend because she helped Soong escape.While references are made to Khan Noonien Singh and the Botany Bay, the end becomes a terrible ripoff of the end of Wrath of Khan, where the Augments' ship is attacked by the Enterprise, all but the leader dies, the leader's face is half-burnt, and he examines a dead friend, then crawls over to a console to trigger his ship's self-destruct, though he's ultimately averted.",2

The augments have the usual failings that lead to their destruction. Soong caused them to be flawed and the flaw was a psychotic genome. The Enterprise continues to wait until it is practically disabled to fire on another ship. If there is doubt as to whether the craft is benevolent or not, that's fine, but here there is no doubt. If it's the Klingons themselves coming toward them, or the commandeered ship with the augments, let's face it, they mean to destroy you. Get in the first licks at least. The conclusion was awfully predictable. If you can't win, kill yourself. I still liked the episode. I also appreciated the Dr. Soon's quick departure from concern for his offspring, recognizing the fallibility of humans. So he grabs a piece of paper and begins to chart out artificial life forms. Gee, I wonder what he had in mind or if he ever succeeded in creating such a thing.",8

They are quick to point their fingers at the Andorians but when Captain Archer points out that they would have nothing to gain from such an attack it is suggested that there is a possibility that Syrranites were involved. These aren't another race but a Vulcan sect who are considered heretics due to their different interpretation Surak' teachings. Surak was the Vulcan for ending their violent ways and developing their belief in pure logic. A search of the embassy leads to the discovery of an unexploded bomb which has the DNA of a leading Syrranite and soon after T'Pol is visited by her husband who informs her that her mother is with the Syrranites and gives her an artefact which maps a path to where they can be found. She is in a desert known as The Forge which can't be accessed by transporter due to the electrical activity there. Archer and T'Pol beam down to the edge of The Forge and go in on foot and end up meeting a Syrranite who, after being critically injured, puts his hand on Archer's face and says something in Vulcan; after this Archer's behaviour starts to change subtly and he knows things only a Syrranite would know. While Archer and T'Pol are out of contact on the surface the Vulcan Ambassador Suval mind melds with the only witness to the bombing, a security guard in a coma, and learns the real bomber was working for the Vulcan High Command.This was a gripping episode which had the feel of a murder mystery in some ways; suspects were set up only to be proved innocent and those one least suspect turn out to be guilty. There is also plenty of action including the initial explosion, the finding of the second device which explodes just as the away team beam out and an animal attack and violent storm in The Forge. Regulars Scott Bakula and Jolene Blalock put in good performances as Archer and T'Pol and are ably supported by guest star Gary Graham who plays Suval.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" The Forge (TV Episode 2004)","Oh, those nasty and tricky Vulcans.","One aspect of ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" that I enjoyed was its treatment of the Vulcans. While the Vulcans were pretty cool folks by the time of ""Star Trek"", here in this prequel, the Vulcans are generally haughty, difficult and cannot be trusted. This episode and the next two are excellent bridges--one that connects the better Vulcans to the jerk-faces you often see in ""Star Trek: Enterprise""!When the show begins, there's an explosion at the Earth embassy on Vulcan. Lots of folks are killed and the evidence seems to indicate a strange sect of Vulcans, the Syrrannites, are responsible. Some of the Vulcan High Command really have a strong dislike for these mystical Vulcans and they are thrilled when the Enterprise send T'Pol and Archer to capture the killer. This trip takes them to a super-inhospitable desert and a strange meeting indeed with one of the Syrrannites...a Syrrannite who gives Archer a most peculiar gift at the end of the show.This is a very exciting episode but more importantly it fills in a lot of gaps and is an excellent look at the evolution of the Vulcans from a bunch of jerk-faces to a bunch of mystical semi-jerk-faces. Well worth seeing.",10
3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" The Forge (TV Episode 2004)","Rest in Peace, Admiral","""The Forge"" takes place on the planet of Vulcan. A bomb has gone off inside the Earth embassy, killing dozens of humans and Vulcans in the process, including Admiral Forrest. The blame is initially placed on Andorians, then by a minority sect of Vulcans known as Syrrannites. T'Pol's mother happens to be a member of this sect and many of them head into hiding. But an investigation by the crew of the Enterprise unearths a conspiracy placing the blame on members on the High Council. Archer and T'Pol head off on a pilgrimage within a hostile desert of Vulcan known as The Forge to locate the sanctuary of the Syrrannites and get to the bottom of the terrorist attack. Right off the back end of the Augments story arc we quickly dive back into another one regarding the relationship between Earth & Vulcan. The Vulcans have always been depicted as more nefarious on ST:E than on shows further along chronologically and this episode is no exception. According to the trivia section of IMDb, this miniseries of episodes intends to clean up the Vulcans image and explain away the differences in their demeanor. So far it's off to a good start. The references and ""fan service"" as one review deems it maybe a bit much but I don't think it occurred enough nor was blatant enough for me not to enjoy this episode. Ambassador Soval is at his best in this episode. It looks to be a monumental event for both Vulcans and the relationship they have with the humans.",8

One of these is T'Pol's mother. She has joined forces with these people. She has been branded a traitor. There are many elements of past Vulcan activity that we have seen before. Apparently, for some, the use of certain elements of the Vulcan history shouldn't be put before us. What I enjoyed is that the rebel peoples are really interesting. Also, a rebel who aids Archer and his Vulcan first officer, dies in the effort but transfers information to Archer as he breathes his last.",9
5,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" The Forge (TV Episode 2004)","Perhaps the most ""inside"" episode of Season 4","Like most of Season 4, ""The Forge"" is mere fan service. What is ""fan service?"" When a writer spends much of the screen time making references to past episodes just so fans can say ""oh cool, I remember that!"" even though it doesn't help the current story.The writers decided to do an episode on Vulcan so they had to have a Sehlat (Spock's pet from ""Yesteryear""), a ""katra"" (from Star Trek III) and of course T'Pau (from ""Amok Time"") and Surak (from ""The Savage Curtain""); and then the Syrranite starts asking Archer the same test questions the computer asked Spock in Star Trek IV. By the time we got to the IDIC (from ""Is There In Truth No Beauty?""), which most TOS fans remember was first and foremost a product placement for a medallion Gene Roddenberry was trying to sell, I was seriously groaning. Making a reference for the sake of a reference is just not interesting.The next two episodes were slight improvements in this regard. Still, I always had a problem with ""Enterprise's"" portrayal of all of Spock's ancient, treasured Vulcan practices as brand-new only a hundred years earlier. Vulcans in ""Enterprise"" don't know much about mind-melding and even less about the katra even though they are supposed to be time- honored customs in TOS. Besides, Vulcans' life-spans are too long. Most of the characters currently alive on ""Enterprise"" will still be alive when ""Star Trek"" rolls around. When the Priestess in ""Star Trek III"" says the transfer of katras from one person to another ""has not been done since ages past, and then only in legend"" what she should have said was ""this was done about a hundred years ago, successfully, also between a Human and a Vulcan, by someone who is probably still alive and a member of this council, and the katra belonged to the Jesus Christ of the Vulcan people ... so it was a pretty famous case that we should all remember.""The rest of this arc was better service for the characters of Trip and Soval but another poor showing for the Vulcan High Command, this time being run by a particularly irrational Vulcan who favors hanging on to outdated beliefs even when presented with new evidence, which is usually the act of a religious zealot, which is what he accuses the Syrranites of being. Like most of the Season 4 arcs, this could have been shortened to one episode without losing anything. That would have left room for many more stories and then even the stinkers would mercifully only take up a single precious hour of the season.",3

When she learns that the spirit of Surak, the founder of Vulcan logic, has been passed to Archer she performs a ritual to move that spirit into herself but it turns out that Surak has decided to remain within Archer.

As the attacks begin Archer takes T'Pau and T'Pol with him to find a mythical Vulcan artefact which Surak has revealed the location of. As the episode ends Enterprise is seen heading to Andoria in order to warn them of a potential attack by the Vulcans.This is a gripping episode which has plenty of tense moments and a well handled death scene where Jolene Blalock does a fine job as T'Pol, managing to show both restraint and subtle emotion when her mother does. Guest stars Kara Zediker and Joanna Cassidy are good as T'Pau and T'Pol's mother T'Les, both acting well and showing that it is possible to look good without wearing a revealing costume.

In the first episode, the Earth embassy on Vulcan is bombed--and the trail to the culprits leads to a mystical Vulcan cult, the Syrrannites. By the end of the show, you've learned several things--that the Syrrannites are NOT responsible but were set up AND Soval has learned the truth and was, as a result, thrown off the High Council! At the beginning of this second part, Archer somehow KNOWS how to find the Syrrannites. Their hiding place is well hidden but somehow he goes right to it. How? He has the essence or soul of Surak inside him-- the father of logic and niceness in the Vulcans. At first, the Syrrannites don't believe this but through a mind meld they learn the truth. What's next? See the show...I don't want to spoil anything.This episode is exciting start to finish and is definitely worth your time. It is a wonderful look at the future of the Vulcans--how they so quickly changed from duplicitous and nasty to swell folks who truly embrace logic.

4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Awakening (TV Episode 2004)",Archer is Yet Again the Chosen One,"In ""Awakening"", Archer & T'Pol have arrived at the Syrrannite sanctuary and reunited with T'Pol's mother, T'Les. It is revealed that the traveler they met on the path was Syrran and he had transferred the katra of Surak to Archer. T'Pau attempts to remove this from Archer and transfer it to herself to no avail. Archer finds an ancient artifact related to Surak deep in the caverns of the sanctuary with the help of the katra. He has visions of talking with Surak and learns he is needed to show Vulcans the way. While all this is happening, Trip and Ambassador Soval are busy with diplomatic relations with the High Command. The High Command maintains that the Syrrannites are responsible for the bombing but the Enterprise isn't buying it. Administrator V'Las is attempting to find and wipe out the Syrrannites and wants the Enterprise to leave Vulcan so there no outside witnesses. He begins using force to kick the humans out of orbit. Trip learns that the Vulcans are planning a preemptive strike on Andoria. The Enterprise heads there as the episode ends.During the first 3 seasons of ST:E, the Vulcans have been portrayed as ethically ambiguous but these series of episodes in Season 4 takes this to a whole new degree. The High Command is basically performing genocide on a minority pacifist faction. Fans of other Star Trek shows know this is at odds with their general demeanor. Everything about the Vulcans just feels off with these episodes. They aren't using logic, they convey a lot of emotion in their dialogue, they just feel off. The administrator has turned almost into a dictator in this. I find it hard to believe that the rest of the High Command would go along with his plans without pushing back because these plans border upon the illogical. All this being said, the episode still makes for good sci-fi. I'm a bit tired of Archer playing the part of the Chosen One though. First, Agent Daniels said he was the Chosen One; now it's Surak. Archer hasn't shown us anything in his character to prove to us that he's this great, wise leader that is causing all this spectacular change. He's a tad arrogant at times but I feel it's unjustified. I assume this story arc ends with the Vulcans culture changing to the culture we know further on in other shows. I'm intrigued as to how we get to this point. The downfall of the High Command seems necessary for this to take place.",7
5,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Awakening (TV Episode 2004)",When are Vulcans Not Vulcans?,"In these three ""Vulcanian"" episodes of Enterprise.Back in Carbon Creek, Vulcans acted like Vulcans. Here, in the middle episode of this arc, they are squabbling teenagers with too much Vulcan- Sex-Juice, whatever the hormone is called on Vulcan, on Earth we call it something like ""Testosterone"".These ""Vulcans"" and even their new ""Surak"" all act as if they are in the midst of Pon Farr and participating in the ""Kalifi"" part of ""Kunat- Kalifi"" - In other words, the raging kill-each-other stage.Even the Vulcan Officials on the planet act this way. Sorry, I just didn't believe it.Vulcans are not HUMANS. In these episodes, they are acting very much like humans, using deceit and treachery - Even offering violence and Destruction of the Enterprise, not to mention trying to destroy a whole group of their own people on the surface.And this is supposed to be T'PAU. In The Original Series, this character was played by Celia Lovsky and she actually ADOPTED All of Nimoy's Vulcanian Mannerisms. She was a Vulcan's Vulcan. Here, played by Kara Zediker (Who was ""The Golden Hind"" in one episode of Hercules: Legendary Journeys, because Kevin Sorbo's wife could not get down to New Zealand at the time) she shows none of the GRACE and AUTHORITY of Celia's T'PAU.Even the name, T'PAU has to be yelled out loud, and spelled with all capital letters, if you think of how she was in The Original Series- She was a Human, or rather Vulcan Exclamation Mark - This was a person to take very seriously- And In that episode, Starfleet backs way down for her.I do not believe that this is the same T'PAU. This is rather, T'Pau: lower case T'Pau. Kara has NONE of the Earned Authority we grant the older version, and it is not enough to explain this away as a ""younger version"" - Because even a younger version would at least have the same accent!I'm surprised Andre Bormanis would write this episode, he was one of the main science consultants for Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager. I don't fully blame him, it was the Direction. Roxann Dawson, although being exemplary on a few Voyager episodes, fails to make us believe in any of this.T'Pol's mother ""T'Les"" is in these episodes, Joanna Cassidy. Had she played the character more like ""Zhora"" from Blade Runner, I would have believed it more.So I give this episode 15 points for the effects as usual, but I give the episode -7 points for the masticating of traditional Vulcans.Because I do not believe ANY of the so called Vulcans in these episodes. Vulcans, especially female Vulcans have a beauty and a Grace and a solemn charm, like the Elves from Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings. Vulcans should be more like Galadriel or Elrond, and less like Gimli- Or Azog the Destroyer as they appear here!",8

Meanwhile in Vulcan Captain Archer, T'Pol and T'Pau are attacked by Vulcan soldiers while transporting the Kir'Shara to the High Command. V'Las is questioned by Minister Kuvak that is not convinced that the Andorians have the Xindi technology. V'Las orders the Vulcan attack to the Andorian fleet, but the Enterprise stations between the two forces expecting to avoid the battle. ""Kir'Shara"" is an excellent conclusion to the saga of Archer with the Syranites. The story is engaging, full of action and suspense and very well developed; the Administrator V'Las is a despicable villain and the forged evidences for the attack to Andoria seems to be inspired in invasion of Iraq in 2003. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Kir'Shara""",9
1,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Kir'Shara (TV Episode 2004)",Preventing a war!,"With Archer and T'Pol trapped on Vulcan while the Enterprise heads to Andoria to warn them of the Vulcan's plan to attack them the action is divided in this episode. Having found the Kir'Shara, an artefact containing the teachings of the founder of Vulcan logic, he, T'Pol and T'Pau must evade the troops searching for them and take it to the High Command in order to persuade enough of its members to stop the war before it starts. On board the Enterprise not all of the crew agree with Commander Tucker's decision to head to Andoria rather than returning to Earth as ordered. Getting to Andoria is one thing persuading them that they are about to be attacked and need to redeploy their fleet is another. To this end they seek out Commander Shren, he doesn't immediately believe Vulcan ambassador Soval so kidnaps him and tortures him. Unfortunately for Soval he has to keep enduring the torture till Shren believes him. This isn't the end of the conflict though as the Andorian fleet along with Enterprise must confront and fight the Vulcans until Archer can get them to end the conflict.This was a great conclusion to the three part story, it contained plenty of action including a space battle and hand to hand combat. The regular cast were joined by some great guest stars including Kara Zediker, who played T'Pau, Gary Graham who played Soval and Jeffrey Combs who played Shren, the last of the three is clearly a versatile actor as he has played several characters in the various Star Trek series each of which is very different. I like how the hot tempered Andorians are from a cold planet and the emotionally cold Vulcans are from a hot world. While this episode is the final of a three part story the ending set up a new story when we learn that the head of the Vulcan High Command was in fact a Romulan agent... unfortunately the series was destined to be cancelled before this plot line could be resolved.",9

T'Pol is captured and then reunited with Archer and T'Pau. Enterprise ends up in the middle of a battle between the Vulcans and the Andorians. There is a lot of torture and negotiating. Battle fatigue seems to permeate all members of these encounters. There is a surprising development concerning T'Pol at the conclusion. These three part stories work very well.",10

Archer has discovered the Kir'Shara and plans to bring it to the High Council in the hopes of preventing a war with the Andorians. But the administrator has sent out a team in an attempt to stop them and wipe out the remaining Syrrannites. Trip has taken the Enterprise, along with Ambassador Soval, to a nebula where Shran is located. They try to alert Shran of the danger of the surprise attack the High Council is planning but he is skeptical. Shran kidnaps Soval and tortures him in the hopes of finding out the actual location of the Vulcan fleet. The Enterprise must juggle itself and attempt to remain neutral but also prevent an all-out war from starting. Archer must find a way to show the Kir'Shara to the High Command.This was a suitable end to the story. Archer saves the day, Trip helps stall long enough to prevent a war from breaking out, and V'Las is relieved of duty. The final scene caught me by surprise; I was not expecting a Romulan to appear on Enterprise. But it does help explain why this rift between the council had been taking place recently. The Kir'Shara's teachings will most likely increase the differences between the Vulcans & Romulans. They will not be able to see eye to eye. The passing of T'Les is sad; I would have like to have seen her develop as a character more. It also seems mighty convenient that T'Pol was released from her marriage so easily. This clears the way for Trip to swoop in on her.",8
4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Kir'Shara (TV Episode 2004)",Loose Ends,"""Kir'Shara"" is the final episode in Enterprise's Vulcan trilogy and all of its greatness comes from that. The episode and its two predecessors are complete fan service and answer questions fans have been concerned over for some time. Continuity abounds in this one as it ties up many loose ends concerning the behavior of Vulcans throughout the series and it finally opens up the Earth-Romulan war arc which the series, had it continued, would have eventually went to. ""Kir'Shara"" gives many of our characters time to shine. Archer, whose contempt for the Vulcans dominated the first two seasons of the show, gets to become the savior for Vulcan and his actions directly impact the Vulcan culture for years to come. T'Pol gets resolution on a sickness that has been plaguing her for several seasons, and Trip starts to come into his own as a leader, commanding the Enterprise to avert a war between Vulcan and Andoria. The episode itself is simplistic and straight forward and all of its greatness comes from its continuity and resolution, not to mention the ending which leaves us wanting more. Episodes such as this are ones that help to give Enterprise its own voice by becoming the prequel it was meant to be, and I find myself wishing that I had a few more seasons with more episodes just like this one.",8

However, Tucker suspects that the scientist is not telling the truth about his experiment and discloses his concerns to Captain Archer. When a crew member of Enterprise is killed by a strange life force and T'Pol is wounded in her hand, Dr. Emory finally reveals that the experiment is indeed his last attempt to bring his son Quinn back from an accident with the transporter fifteen years ago.""Daedalus"" is one of the weakest and most incoherent episodes of Enterprise, with the attitude of Captain Archer risking Enterprise and its crew to satisfy the experiment of his friend to bring his son back. The hand of T'Pol, injured by Quinn, apparently is recovered by Dr. Phlox since there is no further reference to the incident. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Dédalo""",6

When they enter an empty area of space where they are due to carry out the experiment something strange happens, some sort of entity appears on board and when it comes into contact with a crewman that man dies. It soon becomes clear that the experiment was just an excuse to get Enterprise to that part of space; Dr Erickson lost his son in a transporter accident fifteen years before and he believes that because of the properties of space in that area it will be possible to rematerialise him.After several multi-part action packed episodes this one felt a little slow. It seemed a little too obvious that the great Dr Erickson wouldn't be quite as great as everybody thought. I was a bit surprised when Captain Archer agreed to continue with Dr Erickson's plan even though he'd lied to him and it has already caused the death of one crewman. The ending wasn't quite as I expected and that is a good thing, although I won't spoil it I think the way it ended was right.",7

It seems that in these early days of transporters, accidents were common and Erickson's son was lost during this time. His plan is to try to get his son back...but is it possible if he's been lost all that time? As for Trip, he's worried about Erickson's experiments and the Captain is all for letting the old guy give it a go.This is an amazingly bland and adequate episode.

The young man was Archer's childhood friend and this man like a father. If anything, this conflict of interest is at the center.

And refusing to listen to Trip who has proven himself over and over as one of the most trustable people in space! I wanted to personally strangle Archer who, more than half the time, acts like he needs to be put on meds. At least this time, Archer didn't get beaten up - I am really tired of seeing people in this show getting beaten up. Remember how cerebral Picard was? Or how sly Janeway could be? Sigh. Frankly, I don't know how someone as bad as Archer in controlling his childish emotions could even get this far in Star Fleet.",5

The Enterprise heads out to deep space to conduct this experiment but, when a member of the crew dies under mysterious circumstances, it becomes apparent that Dr. Erickson isn't being truthful about the purpose of his experiment. Dr. Erickson is played by Bill Cobbs. I'm a big fan of a lot of his roles but boy, he is sleepwalking through this one! He's not engaging in this episode at all. Just watching him was making me sleepy. In recent episodes, it had appeared that Archer had matured as Captain and started making better decisions regarding the mission and his crew. He had stopped being so self-centered and strong headed. Apparently, I had spoken too soon. Archer puts the entire crew in jeopardy when he approves Erickson's insane experiment. Even after Archer learns the truth and one of his crew members has died due to Erickson's nefariousness, Archer seems to have no ethical dilemma allowing things to continue. He doesn't mourn for Burrows' loss, he doesn't listen to his officers' advice, he risks everyone's life in the small hope that Erickson can bring back Archer's childhood friend. If this were some random person, do you think Archer would go through with it? I doubt it; this is nepotism at work! Archer should have to answer to Star Fleet for his actions but he gets off scott-free. When rating an episode like this, I have trouble sometimes differentiating between poor character choices and a poor storyline. Just because Archer is being dumb doesn't necessarily mean that the episode is bad. But in this case, I feel that it is both. The acting in this one is poor (Leslie Silva is especially bad), the plot is boring for the vast majority of the runtime, the resolution feels unwarranted. Nothing in this episode really works for me. It's a lot of filler.The only important thing to really happen is that we learn that T'Pol no longer has Pa'nar Syndrome, thanks to the mind melding abilities of T'Pau. That plotline really never goes anywhere and it feels as if they decided to just write it off and end it. I'm just glad they didn't forget about it.",4

This is a fascinating story of how a prime directive can be used as an excuse to lose all the traits that are worth having. I don't know if there are really universal truths. It would seem that if there was such a thing as a superior, advance species, that species may view those who are behind them on the evolutionary scale as we view insects. The difference is that we are sentient, with a need to surpass what we are and to love and connect with others of our kind. When the Organians come on board, using hosts from the crew, they are strictly analytical researchers. Watching their subjects die doesn't faze them because they've watched it thousands of times. But the rub is what is the point of evolving without those qualities of compassion and sacrifice. I suppose we could make a case for our psychotic dictators who served their self interest. But these oddities in the stream don't speak for the species. If anything, they are the exception that proves the rule. Archer speaks well. I suppose on could make the case that such a lowlife like Archer could never convince such an advanced set of beings. It is not unlike our Captain Kirk. He managed to out-think Nomad. Remember.

As the Away teams return Trip suddenly gets ill and after landing the shuttle Hoshi also succumbs to the mystery illness. Dr Phlox's investigation leads him to find that they are suffering from a silicon based virus which will kill them both in a matter of hours if he can't find a cure. At this point we learn that there was a very good reason for Malcolm and Travis acting out of character; they had been possessed my non-corporeal aliens who wish to observe how humans will deal with the situation. Phlox comes up with an idea about how to save them but to administer the possible cure they will have to move them from quarantine to sickbay and either Phlox or the captain must expose himself to the virus as the equipment can't be operated while wearing protective suits. As it looks like crew members are going to start dying the two aliens argue about whether or not they should intervene to save the infected crew.This was an good episode that managed to be exciting without any spectacular action scenes. While I immediately thought that Malcolm and Travis were behaving rather strangely I didn't work out that they were actually possessed by aliens for some time, I liked that they were just observers and hadn't deliberately infected anybody and that the infection would have happened if they weren't there, in fact ultimately their presence saves the crew. It was good to see Hoshi take a more central role for a change as Linda Park is good in the role.",9

Meanwhile, two non-corporeal beings have taken possession of Travis & Reed. Their mission is to examine how different species react to the virus; they consider first contact if they deem a species worthy. The two consider intervening to stop the deaths of the Enterprise crew.This episode has a bit of a low rating (some may find its slow pace boring) but I fathered enjoyed it. It really shows the compassionate and empathetic side of human behavior, even when the end results aren't logical. The observers have evolved so far above most other species that they've given themselves a bit of a superiority complex. It takes this new observer (who seems to be on one of its first missions) to change protocol and remind its partner about the common decency in the universe. Their laboratory may be gone, but they've gained a valuable piece of perspective. This episode may be a tad heavy-handed but it's enjoyable, nonetheless. Note: I also enjoyed the way Hoshi's corpse springs up when the being enters her and talks to Archer, very eerie.",8

When his guests are duly lodged, Arched is informed by the bridge that they had located a distress signal from Kumari and they head to the spot. They rescue nineteen survivors from the complement of eight-six of Kumari and bring them on board. While having a conversation with Shran, the Enterprise is attacked by an Andorian warship. Gral and Shran blame each other for the attacks, but Archer and T'Pol discover that the vessel actually has a sophisticated camouflage system to lure both sides and avoid their accord. ""Babel One"" is an engaging and humorous episode of Enterprise. There are funny moments, like the training of Archer with Soshi and the greetings of Archer to Gral.

It's also one that hearkens back to one of the original ""Star Trek"" episodes--""Journey to Babel"", which also features many of the same races. The show begins with the Enterprise taking a Tellarite ambassador to a meeting on Babel in order to try to work out their ongoing hostilities with the Andorians. However, soon after, an Anrdorian ship, Shran's, is destroyed and the Enterprise is called to rescue the survivors. Here's the problem--the attacking ship seemed to be Tellurite!! Naturally this makes the upcoming peace conference nearly impossible--and Shran and the Ambassador are ready to kill each other!When you see these shows, it's really sad, as this new plot is wonderful and would have been great had the show not been prematurely canceled. Who knows where all this might have gone? Unfortunately, the episode is a great case of just coming too late. Sad because it's so well written and interesting.",10

Enterprise meanwhile has been given the job of escorting the Tellarite ambassador and his entourage to a conference where he is due to begin negotiating with the Andorians. En Route they pick up Shren's distress beacon and reroute to pick up the survivors. Shren tells Captain Archer about what happened but when the accusations are put to the Tellarite they vehemently deny having anything to do with the attack. Not long afterwards Enterprise comes under attack from what appears to be an Andorian vessel but it refuses to answer when Shren orders them to stand down and when he fires at what should be the ship's vulnerable spot it has no effect. The Tellarites of course believe this to be an Andorian plot to prevent them from getting to the conference. The attacking ship retreats but Enterprise follows it and makes a shocking discovery; the ship is neither Andorian nor Tellarite but has employed holographic technology to give it the appearance of their ships. When an away team beams over they discover that it is an unmanned ship which T'Pol suspects might be Romulan.This was a good episode that constantly kept the viewer wondering whether the guilty party would be Andorian or Tellarite before revealing that it was neither. The end where Shren tells his mortally wounded wife that she had just suffered a minor injury was quite touching; Jeffrey Combes does well in the role. Amusement was provided early on when we learnt that the Tellarite are blunt to the point of rudeness; in fact if somebody is not rude to them they are liable to take offence. After a couple of stand alone episodes it is nice to get another multi-part story ending with the words '...to be continued'.,8

They seem a bit slow-going at first, and the threat of tiny probe ships seems hardly on par with what Enterprise had to face in the previous episodes' conflict with the Xindi, but they're good in that they show the growing trust between Archer and Shrann (who at one point engage in an exciting duel with razor-like weapons in an ancient Andorian ritual to save Shrann's besmirched honor), and they also provide commentary on society's racial castes in the sub-treatment of the Andorians telepathic Albino people, one of whom is needed to stop the renegade Andorians assassin ships. Good action and heartfelt performances, especially from the Albino Andorian girl and her relationship with the mystery pilot of the evil ship, and yet another example of what a good show we lost in ""Enterprise""'s premature cancellation.",8

The Tellarites have had bad blood with the Andorians for a long time. The episode begins with a summit that is to occur to talk some peace. Archer welcomes (sort of) the Tellarites on board (they've met before when Porthos peed on one of their trees and almost caused an interstellar incident). Meanwhile, it appears that these people have attacked Shran's ship, killing most of the crew. Enterprise answers the distress call and manages to get the few survivors on board, including his friend/enemy/whatever Shran. Of course, there's a powder keg on the ship. The weird thing is that neither side was responsible. It appears that the Romulans are the perpetrators. They have never posed a threat before but it seems are intent on preventing alliances.

The two species have been feuding for a century and it is up to Earth to be the intermediary for peace talks. The Enterprise is taking a Tellarite ambassador into Andorian space when the Enterprise receives an SOS. It's from Shran; he claims that his ship has been destroyed by a Tellarite ship, worsening relations between the two. But soon the Enterprise is attacked by an Andorian vessel. Trip & Reed get transported onto the alien ship and soon discover that thus isn't your standard battle cruiser. Meanwhile, Archer attempts to keep the two groups separated on Enterprise. This comes to a head when Shran breaks out of his quarters and holds the Tellarites at gunpoint. Archer breaks up the tension by revealing that both groups have been fooled by the Romulans who are trying to prevent an alliance from forming. We end with the discovery that the Romulan ship is unmanned, being controlled remotely from Romulus. This was a very fun, fast-paced episode. Anytime the Andorians make an appearance, I'm a happy camper. Shran's topnotch here and his interactions with Archer and the Tellarites makes for good television. Romulans have not been featured very much on ST:E so I'm interested to know how the writers deal with them in this story arc. I especially enjoy the design of their ship, very cool looking. This was a great first episode of the current storyline, we'll see where we go from here.",8

Archer tries to convince the Tellarites and the Andorians to help the Enterprise to destroy the Drone that is destabilizing the area; however Talas dies and Shran challenges Naarg to an Andorian duel called Ushaan. Archer concludes that the Tellarites and the Andorians would not be spendable and decides to be the substitute for Naarg in the mortal combat. ""United"" is an excellent sequel of ""Babel One"".

Back on Enterprise Shren is understandably upset when the woman he loves dies and challenges the Tellarite who was responsible to a duel. Such a fight would almost certainly result in the new alliance collapsing before its first hurdle so Captain Archer takes the Tellarite's place as his death will not damage the alliance. The night before the fight Hoshi and Travis search through the rules to Andorian duels to see if there is a way for it to be fought without the captain or Shren getting killed.This was a good continuation to last week's episode, it contained a series of tense moments including Malcolm and Trips ordeal on the Romulan Ship, the Duel on the Enterprise and a battle between Enterprise and the Romulan ship. The preparation for the duel taught us a bit more about the Andorians; we learn how they have trained to use their weapons since they were children and after the fight we learn what they need their antennas for.",9

Shran demands revenge and challenges the Tellarite to a death match but Archer steps in, volunteering himself in the battle. Archer wants to make sure that a partnership involving the Andorians, Tellarites, Vulcans, and humans to comb the area with their ships to find the mystery ship remains intact, even risking his life to do so. Meanwhile, Trip & Reed are still onboard the craft, trying to figure out how to disable it. Trip gets locked in a chamber and the Romulans subject him to massive amounts of radiation. Reed tricks the Romulans and creates an explosion on the bridge but the drone's auto-repair function quickly begins to rebuild the ship. Archer finds a loophole in the Ushaan and chops off one of Shran's antennas, ending the blood feud without anyone dying. The Enterprise tracks down the mystery vessel and extracts Trip & Reed from it. The rest of the armada pursues the vessel but it quickly escapes.The Federation's origins are clearly on display here as we see the founders working together for a common cause a few years before the Federation's inauguration. The humans positive diplomatic relations with all parties involved helps explain their large role on the committee. This has been an enjoyable story arc thus far. Shran has been great and I loved seeing the Ushaan and getting more backstory on the history and culture of the Andorian people. Talas had been a good tertiary character and I was sad to see her go, especially because the death was fruitless. I didn't really like that they made her Shran's love interest recently though. Just let him be upset about the death of his officer; no need to muddy it up with a love subplot. Archer quickly rectifies the bad deed anyway by exploiting a loophole in Andorian customs. I wasn't too big a fan of that part. I do enjoy Archer and Shran's mutual respect for one another. I'm not exactly sure where we go from here... The ship has escaped; the Enterprise has its officers back. Where will this finale takes us?",8
3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" United (TV Episode 2005)",Major Conflict Between Major Adversaries and Now the Romulans,"This episode brings the Romulans into the equation. They are far out in the galaxy and shouldn't have all that much invested. It is implied that the alliance between the Andorians and the Tellarites is not to their liking. On board the Enterprise, bad things are happening between the enemy cultures. Shran is there and he resents the Tellarites because he blames them for the loss of his ship and much of his crew. We are, however, made aware that a third party is at work here but these two refuse to listen to Archer because they suspect collusion. When the enemy ship is recognized, Trip and Malcolm find themselves investigating it, but there doesn't seem to be a crew. One of the Tellarites kills Shran's girlfriend after the Andorians face off against them. There's also a rather weak element with Shran and Archer fighting each other in a death challenge.",9

Part one involves attacks that exacerbate tensions between the Tellurites and Andorians. Here in part two, Malcolm and Trip go on a mission to figure out who is responsible--and they manage to sneak aboard a ship that can imitate other ships! In other words, Romulans are using this strange drone to sow anger and war because they want to destabilize the quadrant. Instead, they manage to unify these enemies because they eventually realize that they are being manipulated. I liked this plot quite a bit. However, there was a plot involving a debt of honor and a fight to the death that seemed unnecessary and, perhaps, only there to fill out the episode. Still, the show keeps your interest and the Romulans are, as always, enjoyably bad and devious.",8

Shran receives the analysis from Andor and informs that a highly telepathic but pacific subspecies called Aenar is remotely controlling the marauder. Together with Trip and Phlox, T'Pol builds a tele presence unit to interfere with the Drone while Archer and Shran try to convince the Aenar to help them since they need a powerful telepath to operate the unit. They discover that the local Gared was abducted and may be helping the Romulans; however his sister Jhamel is decided to help her brother using the tele presence unit in Enterprise. ""The Aenar"" is an excellent conclusion of a trilogy. The story is engaging, with great dialogs, and the screenplay uses a beautiful visual concept in the ice.

1,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" The Aenar (TV Episode 2005)",An excellent conclusion to the Romulan trilogy.,"Late in the life of ""Star Trek: Enterprise"", the writers came up with three fabulous and exciting episodes involving the Romulans trying to destabilize the quadrant and prevent alliances between the Andorians and Tellurites. However, Enterprise is able to determine that some sort of drone is sowing discord--as it can imitate other ships and the recent attacks on an Andorian ship was NOT done by the Tellurites but this drone!This particular episode brings the crew to a remote frozen location to look for any of the Aenar--a subspecies of Andorians who apparently are the ones piloting the evil drone for the Romulans. It's odd, as the Aenar are a peaceful, blind race and you wonder why any of them would kill for these Romulans.Overall, this is a fine conclusion to the trilogy. It's well written, exciting and well worth seeing. Plus, I like ANY show featuring Shran!",9

Analysis of the pilot's brainwaves shows that he is a member of a secretive sub-species of Andorians known as the Aenar. The Aenar are white-skinned, blind, live in the coldest region of Andoria and most importantly they are telepaths. Shren and Captain Archer beam down to their caverns but it appears that they have wasted their time as the pacifist Aenar refuse to help. One of them however says she will help them; she is the Sister of the Jhamel who was abducted to pilot the Marauder. When they set off again they find themselves under attack from two Marauders, Lissan must contact her brother and persuade him to end the conflict.This was a great conclusion to the three-part story; it was good to see Archer and Shren cooperating again and it was interesting to learn more about Andoria. Lissan was a good character; the scene between her and her brother was quite touching. As the episode ended it looked as if Enterprise may lose a crewmember; Trip is clearly having difficulty working with T'Pol as he still has strong feelings for her.",8

Archer and Shran head to the Aenar colony on Andoria and learn that, although the Aenars are a peaceful people, one of their members went missing a few years ago with no explanation. The Aenar refuse to get involved in the war but Jhamel, sister of the missing Aenar, agrees to help in order to save her brother. The Enterprise creates a device to telepathically disrupt the Romulans' drone in the hopes of destroying it. Jhamel communicates with her brother, convincing him to destroy the drones. The Romulans kill the pilot in frustration. As the episode ends, Trip asks Archer for a transfer, no longer feeling confident in his abilities aboard Enterprise due to the distractions his relationship with T'Pol is causing him.Season 4 has been chalk full of these 3 part story arcs so far and I think this one has been the best of the bunch. Even though ""The Aenar"" was my least favorite episode of the trilogy, it does a good enough job wrapping up the plotline and its threads effectively. I enjoyed the Aenar people as a whole though. I did feel as if we spent too much time setting up this plotline about Trip being bad at his job now due to T'Pol.I also didn't understand what Gareb's motivations were. Why did he agree to kill people if he was a pacifist? He thought he was the last Aenar but that doesn't explain why he decided to start helping the Romulans after they kidnapped him. That scene felt like it could have been fleshed out a bit more. This has been a solid trilogy of episodes. The Andorians help bring a lot to the table and I loved how much screentime Shran receives. The dawning of the Federation is upon us.",7

All through the Star Trek epic, the Romulans seem to be the most humorless, the most intractable of all species. With the exception of the Borg, which is a mass entity, these guys take no prisoners and listen to no one. They are rooted in Vulcan ancestry and have tremendous technology and the power of evil. In this final episode they are using a subspecies of Andorean who has telepathic powers. They've hooked him up to a machine and he controls drones that can take on the appearance of other ships. Archer and Shran go to Adorea and visit a pacifistic people that live in the northern ice. It is a fascinating world. It turns out that the controller is the brother of one of the aliens and she decides to accompany the pair to the Enterprise.

There are few clues to the assailants but it appears they transported from the scene and just before blacking out Hoshi heard them say something that wasn't in English. Meanwhile Trip has transferred to the Columbia and is getting acquainted with his new colleagues. In order to find out what the abductors said T'Pol melds with Hoshi and they learn Phlox was most likely abducted by Rigelians and taken from Earth.

It soon becomes clear that they want him to assist them in finding a cure for a pandemic that is threatening the whole Klingon species. Trip may have moved to a new ship but it appears that he is still connected with T'Pol; when he start so daydream he enters her meditative vision. Malcolm is also having problems; he is in contact with a shadowy organisation within Star Fleet that knows more about Phlox's kidnapping that they want Captain Archer to know. When Enterprise is attacked a group that appears to be human board and sabotage the warp system, one of them is captured and we learn that he is in fact Klingon; cut to Dr. Phlox and we find that they look human because the Klingons have been experimenting with the DNA of human augments to create augments of their own. Unfortunately they have also created an augmented disease. As the episode comes to an end Malcolm is in the brig after refusing to tell the captain what he knows and the ship's warp drive as been corrupted by a Klingon program which could lead to the loss of the Enterprise.This was a good episode with plenty of intrigue. It was fun seeing Hoshi get to take part in the action for a change. The best feature of this episode was how they explained how Klingons changed appearance to look the way they did in the original series of Star Trek. I wasn't so sure about the apparent psychic link between T'Pol and Trip, hopefully it will become more interesting in later episodes. Malcolm's story was pretty interesting as I can't see him committing treason but equally it is hard to think what could be so secret that he'd rather go to the brig than tell Captain Archer.",9

It's too bad the series got canceled when it was finally getting good. I admit that I stopped watching this show for after the first two seasons. The whole romance between T'Pal and Trip was getting WAY to stupid. It was obvious that the ratings were lagging and they were adding sex to spice it up. It's only now that it's in reruns that I'm getting to see the best shows.,7
4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Affliction (TV Episode 2005)","Good episode, poor rationale.","As one who considers ""Enterprise"" an unfairly underrated series, I feel compelled to comment on segments of the sub-par fourth season such as this two-episode arc, that was, in effect, created for the sole purpose of explaining why Klingons in the original series didn't have the distinct ""cranial ridges"" featured in Klingons in ENT, TNG, DS9 and VOY.Even though this ""mini-arc"" is an exciting and well-crafted tale, the rationale behind it is part of the reason that ""Enterprise"" failed as a series. Using the series to ""set-up"" the other Star Trek series that took place in the ""future"" was a sad waste of a good cast, excellent directors, and talented writers. It ultimately does a disservice to them all to use this series as little more than a device to explain events and distinctions found in the series that follow chronologically, even though they were produced years ago.Like the much maligned series finale of ""Enterprise"" that employed members of TNG's cast, thus cheating the audience and the cast of a chance to make their finale about...well, about THEM, this arc is an artistic slap in the face of the Enterprise cast, writers and crew, as it wastes two episodes that could have been used to explore the relationships and develop the characters of Enterprise, instead of just ""explaining"" a matter of extremely minimal concern, i.e., why the Klingons in Kirk's era had smooth foreheads. (I guess the producers felt it would have been too much to just trust that the fans of the series would understand that the reason that TOS's Klingons lacked cranial ridges was a simple matter of less developed make-up skills, and not a viral infection from a genetic augmentation experiment gone awry.)Nevertheless, I gave it a seven (7) for some great action and good writing.

They discover that Phlox's captors are Rigellian and pursue a recently departed Rigellian freighter in the hopees of finding him. Reed begins acting cagey about the whole situation and begins hiding information from Archer, obeying orders from a mystery man. Enterprise discovers the freighter destroyed with no survivors aboard but no sign of Phlox. It appears that a Bird-of-Prey destroyed the ship. Archer is forced to throw Malcolm in the bridge when he continues to lie about the situation. Meanwhile, Phlox has been taken aboard a Klingon vessel and forced to find a cure to a virus spreading through the Klingon Empire. The Klingons got a hold of some Augment embryos and attempted to make Klingon Augments. Their trial was unsuccessful and caused the virus the species is currently afflicted with. Onboard Columbia, Trip attempts to adjust to his new surroundings. This is a very densely packed episode plot-wise. Phlox's kidnapping obviously takes precedent but there are a lot of subplots popping up as well. This episode is Star Trek's way of retconning the Klingons' original facial configuration. That's fine I suppose, though I was never really complaining about the discrepancy. Reed's disloyalty to Enterprise brings up probably the most intriguing questions. What is this shadow organization that he seems to be a part of? Why does it take precedence over Star Fleet?I don't really understand T'Pol & Trip's telepathic daydream connection. I'll let it play out but my knee jerk reaction is that it's very silly. This episode maybe a bit too dense for its amount of time allotted. The end was also extremely anticlimactic.",6

But in this episode, the participations of Phlox, Trip and Reed overshadow Archer and T'Pol. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Ponto de Vista"" (""Viewpoint"")",9
1,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Divergence (TV Episode 2005)",An exciting conclusion to the Phlox Philes.,"When the show begins, Malcolm and Trip work together to transfer Trip in the most insane fashion back to Enterprise. Why? Because the ship has become like the bus on ""Speed""---where it will blow up if it drops to under warp 5! Oh, those kooky augments and their attempt to blow up the ship!In the meantime, Dr. Phlox is dealing with some unreasonable Klingons (are there any other kind?) and it is a race with time-- otherwise the Klingon home world will blow up the planet and everyone on it in order to contain the virus. Phlox MIGHT have an answer-- but one that won't make the grouchy General happy!The best aspect of all this is that it helps to explain the way too human looking Klingons in the original ""Star Trek"" series--and for that reason alone, this is a must-see for fans. Well made, fun and worth seeing.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Divergence (TV Episode 2005)",nice explanations,"Well one great thing about enterprise over the seasons was to explain some discrepancy of STToS and the other series, and this episode brings a nice coherent explanation about the ""klingons"" looking like humans in the original series.. Actually it looks like both the episodes were crafted for that very purpose, but instead of just making this episode as an excuse for it they still managed to bring some interesting things into it, such as columbia or die hard rip off, also some ethics problems came up.. responded in a weird way from flux though, whose usually so keen to follow ethics and went kinda overboard this time around, it's a nice change after all.Also the fact that we don't see ONLY fighter cast in klingons anymore is great, I always hated the klingons episodes in star trek, always useless brainless violence, stupid caricatures to be honest, but with enterprise we see (a little) more than that, it's refreshing...So yes, a great episode, with some interesting facts and explanations , and also the new interest about ""Trip"" (a pretty dull character usually), looking forward for the next episodes!As a side note the whole thing about malcom which was supposed to make him a more interesting character kinda felt short, as usual no consequences arise after an act of treason this time, so that part is to be forgotten",9
3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Divergence (TV Episode 2005)",A change for the Klingons,"This concluding episode to a two-part story opens with Phlox still being forced to help the Klingons find a cure for the plague that has been infecting them since their experiments with augments. Back on Enterprise they are also in trouble; the sabotage carried out by the Klingons means the ship will explode if it goes below warp five. Only one man can undo what they have done, the problem is that he is aboard the Columbia. To get him aboard Enterprise at warp five will not be easy; he will have to cross between the two ships via a tether and the slightest mistake could kill him or even destroy both ships. With Enterprise saved they must get to Dr. Phlox before the Klingon fleet arrives and sterilises the entire base. Phlox does find a cure but it will cause major changes to Klingons for the foreseeable future. While this is going on the Captain learns why Malcolm was acting against his orders and Malcolm realises he can only take orders from one man.This episode was a decent conclusion to the story; the scene where Trip crossed between the two ships was gripping and it seemed quite possible that somebody might get hurt. It was rather fun how the Klingons were changed so that they will appear how they do in the original series thus plugging one of the major inconsistencies between the various series.",8

Phlox & Antaak figure out a way to stop the virus and counteract the effects of the Augment experiment. Archer and the gang show up just in type as a Klingon named Admiral Krell has shown up to destroy the colony and contain the outbreak. Phlox deliberately infects the ship so the Admiral refrains from killing everyone and allows Phlox to generate the cure and treat everyone affected. His cure requires a human host to work more efficiently and Archer volunteers. The cure works but with the drawback of the Klingons losing their cranial ridges and looking more human-like (explaining their appearance on TOS which is next chronologically).This episode was a bit muddled. It felt like they were trying to hard to explain away plot holes in the universe instead of focusing on making a good, interesting story arc. Everything about the plot felt rushed and half-baked. Also, I'm no physicist but that scene involving Trip tethering between the two ships did not feel right.I wasn't a huge part of this two parter, and with the series winding to a close, I hope the remaining episodes are a bit better.",5

Phlox is a hero and the Enterprise carries out a major mission with the help of the newly launched Columbia. The Klingon's through their own ambitions have created a monster that could possibly destroy their entire civilization. Phlox works with a Klingon medical man who has other plans than the warriors. Phlox is able to find a cure, but it takes a great leap by Archer to help him do it. Of course, the idiot Klingons do everything they can to avoid being helped by outsiders. Their solution to the plague is to simply kill everyone who has it. Tucker returns to Enterprise to help in the emergency situation. It's a very satisfying episode. Malcolm has been used by a jerk who recruited him when he was very young.",9

It happened so often I stopped paying attention to the story. I kept watching and waiting for the inevitable zoom that was supposed to make SURE I knew that THIS SCENE IS SUPER SERIOULL (apologies to South Park). Or the shaky cam on a scene that wasn't at all needing it. Or the hyper-dramatic face-offs between Archer and Reed. It felt a little amateurish. It stopped being Star Trek Enterprise for me, and became A Really Melodramatic Show With Really Angry People And Slow Zooms and Fast Zooms and Science That Doesn't Let An Extra-Vehicular Transfer Work With A Winch But Has To Be A Manual Climb Up A Cable Hand Over Hand Because It Makes It Even More Dramatic.",6

These are the guys that sold several crew members into slavery in a previous episode. Archer and several Enterprise crew member accept the Orion's hospitality and after eating, are treated to some green belly dancers (slaves?) who seem to be able to manipulate men. Three of them are soon made gifts to Archer, who stupidly allows them the run of the ship. Soon they have upset the entire balance of the Starship. All the males on board begin to act like salivating teenagers and begin to compromise the mission. Trip and T'Pol seem to have what it takes to resist these women.

He had offered the location to the Starfleet and in return he would ask a commission of 10% of the extraction. Archer has accepted the deal and received the three Orion dancers as a gift. The Orion females affect the entire crew except T'Pol and Trip. Dr. Phlox discovers that the men have a great increase in their pheromone becoming careless in their duties and easily persuaded by the females and the women have headache affecting their concentration on the job. However, the Vulcan T'Pol is not affected and Trip is mind bounded to her. Sooner Archer realizes that the Orion females are not the slaves on board of Enterprise.""Bound"" is a ""sexy"" episode of Enterprise, with Captain Archer receiving a Trojan horse through the form of three female aliens on board of his ship capable of almost destroying the Enterprise. The three actresses do a great job in the role of the Orion females in the lead plot. The romance between T'Poll and Trip is delightfully funny. Dr. Phlox as usual is one of the most pleasant character with his witty lines. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Elo"" (""Link"")",8

Here in ""Bound"", Captain Archer and his crew come into contact with these Orion ladies--but this time the result is very, very different.The show begins with a member of the Orion Syndicate who offers to make peace with Earth and go into business with them. To show his sincerity, he gives Archer three lovely (and VERY scantily clad) green slave girls. However, like the Trojan War, you KNOW that this gift isn't what it appears to be...and soon almost everyone on the ship begins acting strangely!This is a very good episode which will probably annoy some ladies, as the show is much like a male Trekkie's dreams! But it is well made and the twist near the end very nice--so it is worth seeing.",7
3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Bound (TV Episode 2005)",Routine-ish episode slightly saved by core plot developments,"While the irresistible ""Green Women"" of Orion introduced in the Original Trek were presumably too good to miss in at least one episode of ""Enterprise"", they mostly contribute to a fairly lacklustre, predictable episode made 40 years later and encompassing necessary adjustments in line with the thinking of our times, if not the amount of skin coverage achieved by the three women's minimalist attire. Cyia Batten, Crystal Allen and Menina Fortunato do well enough as these heroines, while Billingsley, Bakula, Keating and Montgomery all have some fun with their at-times daft, at-times aggressive characters coming under increasing pheremonal control.The slight saving grace in this one is Connor Trinneer's portrayal of Trip, who has to beat up his newly re-demoted deputy following an act or two of gross insubordination, but is unaffected by the presence of the new females on the ship, thanks to his being helplessly and hopelessly captivated by T'Pol. The latter here appears courtesy of a Jolene Blalock looking far healthier (and a tad more voluptuous) than in earlier episodes of the season, and thus returned to full ""goddess"" status. She's breathtaking here (and actually far more gorgeous than the actress that plays her, which is a fascinating conundrum in itself). And, yes, this is the episode in which she (FINALLY) gives way to her romantic and erotic need for Tucker, and by golly it does somehow feel like it's been worth the wait! The makers taunted us with this for episode after episode, and now here it is! Not quite sure what it's all about (or how vicarious?), but this bit made the episode for me, as I suspect it will have done for many others...",7

The presence of these women cause the human men on the ship to begin to act irrationally (with the exception of Trip). The human women begun suffering from headaches. Dr. Phlox's sleep cycle is out of whack. The only members of the crew unaffected seem to be Trip & T'Pol. Phlox discovers that the women are exuding a pheromone that's causing all of this. T'Pol mating with Trip has evidently made him immune to its powers. All of this is a trap for the Orion ship to return and catch the Enterprise defenseless, taking the wanted Archer to the Orion Syndicate and stealing the Enterprise. It's up to Trip & T'Pol to stop all of this before it's too late. We're hitting the home stretch now and this episode represents a bit of filler. It's a combination of a homage to the original pilot and an excuse for the writers to show off some skin as they like to do from time to time. Trip decides to return to Enterprise, despite the fact that he agreed to leave only a few episodes ago. That plot didn't really go anywhere. There's nothing exceptional about this episode, though Phlox and T'Pol are as good as ever.",6

When they return to Enterprise they are accompanied by the three scantily clad beauties and Archer tells T'Pol that he has made a deal with the Orion captain concerning the mining of a planet. As they head to the planet something strange starts to happen to the crew, the women are getting headaches and most of the men are falling under the spell of the Orion girls due to their pheromones; they are starting to act in an unprofessional way and when the Enterprise come under attack from a ship that poses no threat whatsoever Archer orders Malcolm to destroy it, he refuses however. One of the Orions persuades engineering officer Kelby to sabotage the ship and they are left without propulsion while their master comes to capture Archer. Luckily T'Pol and Trip find away to defeat their assailant and prevent the captain from acting under the influence of the women.This was an enjoyable stand-alone episode; the three Orion girls may have been slaves but it was clear that they had a control of the men on Enterprise. I can see why the crew came under their spell, their behaviour was highly seductive and their costumes were pure fan-service. It was a nice twist to discover that the true slaves weren't the women and that even within Orion society they were the real bosses. The way T'Pol and Trip were immune was a little convenient but was necessary to make the story work and it is nice that there is still a connection between them and that Trip will be staying on Enterprise.",8

Archer, T'Pol, Trip and a small group try to activate the Defiant to battle against the enemy ships.""In a Mirror, Darkly: Part I"" is a weird episode of Enterprise in a parallel universe where tyranny and betrayal rule. The characters have basically the opposite behavior of the regular ones and Hoshi surprises with a sexy performance that seems to be inspired in Mata Hari. The best part of this show is the excellent music score that replaces the annoying and out of context theme of Enterprise. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Reflexo Sombrio"" (""Dark Reflex"")",6
1,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" In a Mirror, Darkly (TV Episode 2005)",Trek at it's very best,"Liked this show from day one. The crew worked well together and, for the fist time in a Star Trek show since The Next Generation, we had a sense of family aboard ship. But this one dealt with another universe completely! This universe, first seen in Mirror Mirror in the original show was brilliantly thought out. In this episode now, we learn of it's origins. Watch the opening sequence for this. Amazing. The entire cast get a good slice of the action and it presented some real twists and turns on the characters we have come to know and love. Fans of Star Trek on a whole should watch this, as it is quite simply put, one of the greatest Star Trek episodes of all time.With a concluding scene to make your jaw drop!!!",10

4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" In a Mirror, Darkly (TV Episode 2005)",Was I the only one who hated this story arc?,"This theme has been done before in Star Trek. The whole alternate universe scenario where the good guys are bad guys. It was not original at all. It was so annoying to see the same situation unfold as before: Senior officers in an alternate evil universe who do not trust each other and use treachery to gain rank. And then you have the seductress who is on the inside of things whose place is in the bed of the captain. It felt so copy-cat and pointless that it was hard to even pay attention. I was waiting to see some character sporting a black goatee. I was very disappointed that I didn't see one. I'd have loved to see Archer in a black goatee. It may have helped his image as an evil man be more convincing. Is it just me or does Archer always seem like an eternal nice guy at heart, and his toughness/heartlessness feels like a charade?Obsession with goatees aside, it was a deviation from the main plot and all the characters were actually cared about. What was the point in it? Was the original storyline that boring?To its credit: The first scene where Cochran shot the Vulcans was actually kind of cool because they actually tried to make the world more realistic and believable. And I appreciated the surprise theme song which confused me and was a bit amusing once I figured out what was going on. But really, overall I felt these two episodes were kind of pointless and lame, especially so near the season's climax. I'd rather be seeing some exciting storyline development, not a silly side-story with made-up characters that has no bearing on any of the other episodes. Shouldn't this play-time for the writers been done earlier on?",2

Back to the present and the Enterprise is different too; Commander Archer has soon become captain after staging a mutiny, Hoshi is the seductive mistress of the old captain but soon moves on to Archer and while T'Pol is still a senior officer it is clear that Vulcans are looked down upon. There is no Federation but a Terran Empire instead... we are in the Mirror Universe. Archer takes the Enterprise into Tholian space where he captures a Tholian and tortures him to give the coordinates of a captured Terran ship. It is not any old ship though, it is from the 'good' universe one hundred years in the future. T'Pol helps Captain Forester retake the ship but Archer has locked the course so they have no choice but to follow his plan and find the mystery ship. Archer and an away team beam over to it and while they are away the Enterprise is attacked and as the words 'To be continue' appear on the screen it appears to explode! This episode was a lot of fun, it was great seeing our favourite characters as the bad guys. Having a completely different opening featuring a series of military vehicles though history and scenes of the Enterprise engaged in combat was inspired. Even the uniforms were changed with the female officers showing far more flesh, sure it was pure fan-service but what does one expect in the evil Mirror Universe. In the past when we've visited the Mirror Universe it has always featured at least one regular person from the 'Good' Universe but here only the evil counterparts are seen and as much as I like the regular characters I must admit their evil counterparts are more fun.",9
6,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" In a Mirror, Darkly (TV Episode 2005)",Readily skippable,"Presumably ""Enterprise"" felt it couldn't really go out with getting into that more aggressive alternative universe first aired in The Original Series and traded on ever since in the various later incarnations of Trek. But this pair of episodes does not really know where it is going, and so squanders several possible messages about how all empires must fall, abut how noble memes leaking in from our universe into theirs might prove powerful enough to change something, and so on. Perhaps these are things we need to know, but it should scarcely take two episodes to achieve that (even if a pretty pointless gorn-hunt is padded out to about 20 minutes!); and there is a tangible sense here that the actors are having more fun with this than we are.Indeed, since there is no contact with any of the characters we know (only their counterpart versions), we have almost no real emotional investment in this one.On the plus side we do get to see an interestingly ""naughty"" version of Hoshi, which offers certain rewards, while there is a flavour of ""Mirror, Mirror"" in that T'Pol and Soval are seen to be somehow worthwhile characters in both universes, thanks to being Vulcan - in just the same way as ""aggressive"" Spock proved a kind of reliable ally in the TOS episode from 1967, which was nevertheless far more nuanced, interesting and ""worth it"" than this 2005 effort.Regrettably, the two ""In a Mirror, Darkly"" episodes seem rather to have been ""killing time"" and - given how precious the last few hours of ""Enterprise"" might have been (especially for fans such as myself), this is a bit of a frustration.",6

While I loved the original ""Mirror, Mirror"", the great evil parallel universe idea was bled dry--with way too many revisitations of the idea. Fortunately, this idea was only used in this and the following episode...plus the style and look of these shows is amazing. What do I mean by this? The normal, wimpy intro to ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" has instead been replaced with a militaristic intro--complete with the symbol of the evil parallel Federation!When the show begins, the Zefram Cochran first contact scene from ""Star Trek: First Contact"" is shown and things seem just fine. However, this has been re-edited--and you realize it when Cochran (James Cromwell) opens fire--killing the Vulcan visitors!!The scene now cuts to the evil Enterprise--complete with most of the same crew from ""Star Trek: Enterprise"". But, like in ""Mirror, Mirror"", these folks are evil, conniving and rotten. How rotten??!! See the show and see for yourself!!The show that follows involves Commander Archer taking control of the ship from his captain! And, he then sets the ship on a secret mission into Tholian space. Why? What's all this about anyway?!This is a mega-cool episode. Sadly, however, it's also one that was filmed AFTER the crew learned that the show was being canceled. Clearly a case of too little too late and this marks one of the better shows...yet only a few episodes later, the series sadly ended.",9

It is more about the explanation of what happened to a missing Federation ship in Tholian space in the distant future. Now this episode totally takes place in the Mirror Universe. AKA Fringe. No transporter accident here sending the good officers to the bad universe, and vice versa, as in the T.O.S. episode. Just a 2 parter in the bad uni. And a lot of fun with all the cast playing different roles. But what ties this to the future Federation is that In a Mirror Darkly, a future Constitution Class Star Ship the Defiant has somehow just appeared in the present, or its past, and has been captured by the Tholians. For those that remember, you now know what happened to the doomed Defiant that Kirk was trapped on for a while during a phase shift. For those not versed watch the Star Trek episode The Tholian Web (Sea3 Ep9). That explains how the Defiant got here. This future Starship has Warp 9 capability superior weapons and shielding. And The Empire (Federation in the good universe) must have ""It"" to tip the scales in their war against Good. Remember, here....... Evil must triumph over Good!!

This tale is a cleverly written continuity barrage that gives fans a high quality and thoroughly enjoyable mirror episode.""In A Mirror, Darkly"" is widely credited as one of the best episodes of Enterprise, and it is easy to see why. There are so many interesting homages to the original series and seeing our 22nd century crew hamming it up makes this two-parter a worthy investment of your time. Star Trek fans will be delighted to see a myriad of references to TOS. Whether it is seeing a Constitution class ship getting a CGI upgrade and strutting its stuff or Soval sporting his ""evil Vulcan goatee"" there is something here for everyone to enjoy. The story is a little heavy handed with the evil versions of our characters, but that does not detract from the overall enjoyment of it. Despite being set in the mirror universe, this episode gives us a reflection on our prime universe in the way of presenting the xenophobia of the humans which becomes a major plot point in the two episodes that follow this one. From the opening teaser to the rise of newly crowned Empress Sato, ""In A Mirror, Darkly"" is a superb episode that is a fun and entertaining ride that leaves fans wishing Enterprise had stuck around for a few more seasons.",8

Also, the music is decidedly more interesting than the usual Enterprise fare. However, the whole ""evil mirror universe"" thing is extremely overdone: In a society that permeated by universal mistrust, treachery and series of usurpations, where any kind of teamwork is overshadowed by force and fear of backstabbing, I can't really envision people being able to get a spaceship into orbit, even less building an empire that lasts for hundreds of years.",7
12,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" In a Mirror, Darkly (TV Episode 2005)",Mirror Universe - Archer Edition,"""In a Mirror, Darkly"" takes place in the mirror universe where members of Star Fleet appear to be evil versions of themselves for the Terran Empire. In this version of events, Admiral Forrest is actually captain of the Enterprise, with Archer being his first officer. The rest of the gang's all there in different shapes and forms: Phlox is still the doctor but gets enjoyment out of torturing victims, Hoshi is Captain Forrest's concubine, Trip is still Chief Engineer but has a gnarled face due to radiation, T'Pol is third in command and wearing a skimpy outfit for the fanboys, Reed is leader of the MACOs, and Travis is a MACO sergeant.Archer has heard rumblings about a parallel universe and how the Tholians have extracted a Star Fleet ship from that universe from its future and are going to reverse engineer it in a war with the humans. Forrest has no interest in investigating this so Archer stages a coup to take over command and lead them to where the ship is reported to be. They have some sort of cloaking device allowing them to get close.The Enterprise shows up and discovers the Defiant being scrapped by the Tholians. Archer and a crew sneak aboard. The Enterprise is discovered and gets itself caught in a Tholian web. Unable to escape or use its weapons, the Enterprise is destroyed with Forrest at the helm.Poor Admiral Forrest, now he's been killed off in both universes, got to feel for the man. I'm always a big fan of these mirror universe episodes. They allow the actors to take on roles and characteristics that we don't typically get to see out of them on the show.I'm not really sure why the Defiant goes back in time when it crosses over after ""The Tholian Web"" episode. It goes back over a century in the mirror universe. I suppose I can by this though. The spacial interphase is a curious thing, so I suppose it's possible that when two parallel universes overlap it causes time to go a bit berserk.I also need to acknowledge just how much better this theme song is compared to the normal one for this series. It's 1,000 times better and I wish someone would just edit out the old one and replace it with this one for all ST:E episodes.I'm curious to see if they incorporated Captain Kirk at all in Part II. I know he was trapped in some type of void, but we shall see if they decide to throw his ghostly specter on the screen at all.",7

It seems the ""Alternate universe"" episodes are a favorite among everyone, especially myself and they also managed to fit in TOS sets and starship to boot. First off, I get the poking fun at the Shat's acting but in reality he's a fine actor that had his unique emphasized ""trademarks"" shall we say, but no one can deny he was born to play Kirk. In contrast Scott Bakula crosses the hammy acting line so many times in this series but especially this episode the line just disappears from fatigue. Even when he's playing the ""normal"" Archer he crosses that line at least a few times every episode but when playing his evil counterpart the director must have been off sick to keep him in check. I myself would get whiplash the amount of times Bakula whips his head around trying to make angry point after angry point. He practically spits/growls half his dialogue. The only one who comes off as a better actor playing his negative counterpart is Anthony Montgomery who usually comes off not so much as bad but as just plain weak. Jolene Blalock and Linda Park play very subtle and believable counterparts amongst the Testosterone fueled male cast members.Well, that was more than enough for this particular episode... until next time.",9
14,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" In a Mirror, Darkly (TV Episode 2005)",Galactic Jekyll and Hyde!,"I started out with the reaction, ""Oh no. Not another parallel universe."" But soon the quality of the presentation and the fine acting came into play. It must have been fun for the regular cast to portray villainous copies of themselves. In the similar version of this on the first Star Trek, the same ploy was taking place. Everyone is consumed with ambition. A weakness in that is that it is too pat, too simple. It assumes that all these folks are either good or bad. Phlox, for instance, becomes utterly psychotic, enjoying the inflicting of pain and death. I never thought of him as good or bad. He is principled. Archer is only a leader when it comes to feathering his own nest. Anyway, the alternate Enterprise is destroyed by the Tholians (surrounded by their web) and now the away team is in command of a death ship. Looks really promising.",9
15,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" In a Mirror, Darkly (TV Episode 2005)","Into The Mirror, Enterprise Style","In its final season on air, the Star Trek prequel series Enterprise finally found its feet. Under a new show runner, the series finally became the prequel series it was originally pitched as being. It explored and tied-in with many aspects of Trek's lore. One of the most exciting moments of that came as the show was beginning to wind down prematurely. In A Mirror, Darkly brought Enterprise into the Mirror Universe made famous by the Original Series episode Mirror, Mirror and explored throughout Deep Space Nine's run. As it turned out, the two-parter was to be among Enterprise's finest hours. For one thing, the two-parter holds a particular claim to fame within Trek. Unlike previous Mirror Universe encounters, this tale wouldn't see one of the regular cast members crossing over to meet his counterparts in another universe. Instead it would take the viewer full stop into it without any regular characters being our ""in"". It was a bold move and one that could only have happened in a show that established itself and its characters well enough to really not worry about alienating viewers. Given Enterprise's ratings by this point in production, it might have even mattered by the choice was a bold one and highly successful.The first episode opens with a choice just as bold: reprising a sequence not from the series but from the feature film Star Trek: First Contact. The scene wonderful melds together newly shot material with what was then almost a decade old material. It's hard to tell where the melds are except for a couple of shots towards the end which speaks to the effort put into it by the show's makers. The choice of reprising the particular scene, a crucial one from that film's climax, also gives the viewer a big, visceral moment of knowing that they are in for something very different indeed.As if that wasn't enough, the title sequence represents a marked change. Beign set entirely in the Mirror Universe gave the production team a chance to play around with the title sequence and its oft-ridiculed opening song. Reedited and with a different piece of music behind it, the title sequence mixes in familiar elements from the title sequence with footage culled from Paramount war films (I recognized shots from The Hunt For Red October and The Sum Of All Fears) along with action shots taken from throughout Enterprise's run. It's another big, bold move that changes the stakes for the 40 minutes or so that follows.Like with previous Mirror Universe episodes in Trek, the fun of these episodes is watching the cast members play different versions of familiar characters. Part one is set largely on Enterprise itself and features the return of Vaughan Armstrong as Forest whom isn't an admiral but is instead captain of the Terran Empire's flagship. Having Armstrong back is fun because it allows us to see two characters in particular in a very different light. The first is Scott Bakula's Archer whom one senses has been passed over one time too many and has finally found his chance to climb up the ranks. Given the goodhearted, sometimes too keen to do the right thing nature of the Archer we normally see in the series, the Mirror Universe Archer comes as a revelation as a man who is almost ruthless at times in a performance one might not have expected out of Bakula. The other big surprise comes out of one of the series' most underutilized cast members as Linda Park's Hoshi gets recast into the Captain's Woman role that we saw Barbara Luna's Marlena play back in Mirror, Mirror but with an updated 21st century edge. They're surprise performances to say the least.They aren't alone though. All of the Enterprise regulars get some interesting moments in this episode though some get more than others. John Billinsley's normally jovial Dr. Phlox is a perfect example of what these Mirror Universe episodes can do as his jovial attitude gets filtered into a performance that is almost repulsive at times in its deviousness. Dominic Keating's Malcolm Reed also gets some interesting moments as well, especially with Bakula's Archer, as does Jolene Blalock's T'Pol in a role that is quite different from what we normally see her play. While Anthony Montgomery and Conner Trinneer end up being shuffled to the back proverbially speaking, they get some screen- time that shows enough of their Mirror counterparts to wet appetites. The other great thing is the episode's tie-ins to larger Trek mythos, as was the case with the entirety of Enterprise's final season. The episode not only ties into the Mirror Universe but also sees a return appearance in Enterprise of the Tholians, including a full-on version of one of them accomplished by some neat CGI work. The Tholians appearance also allows a tie-in with another Original Series episode which debuted them leading to the episode's McGuffin and eventual finale. Mike Sussman ties all of these elements together into a fast paced story that, under the direction of James L. Conway never lets up all the way to its cliffhanger ending.The end result is one of Enterprise's best episodes. From its opening right down to its cliffhanger ending, the first episode throws the viewer full on into the Mirror Universe and never lets them come up for air. Along the way we're given some of the regular cast's best performances playing very different versions of themselves as well as a solid tale that ties into larger Trek lore both within and outside the Mirror Universe. This was only the beginning though...",8
0,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" In a Mirror, Darkly, Part II (TV Episode 2005)",Archer is too ambitious!,"As the second half of this two part story starts Enterprise has been destroyed and the Archer, T'Pol, Malcolm, Travis and Trip are aboard the USS Defiant, a ship from a hundred years in the future. After picking up the survivors from Enterprise they set about repairing the ship; this is made much more difficult when it becomes apparent that they don't have the ship to themselves, a creature known as the Gorn has killed one of the engineering crew and taken vital components. Once that problem has been solved the Defiant can join the battle against the Vulcan and Andorian rebels. Archer expects to be given official command of the Defiant but is just told that he will get his own command 'when a ship becomes available. Believing the admiral intends to steal the glory he kills him. He soon has even greater ambitions and sets course for Earth with plans to but himself on the throne. As he has had all non-humans apart from Dr. Phlox transferred off the Defiant T'Pol tries to persuade the doctor to destroy the ship, as she believes Archer's conquests won't stop with Earth. It is just a pity for Archer that he was so paranoid about his alien crewmembers that he wasn't so careful about the human ones.Like the first part of the story this was a lot of fun; while not strictly necessary for the story it was nice to see the crew don the uniforms of the original Star Trek. There was plenty of great action including a fight between Archer and the Gorn that was reminiscent of a similar fight involving Captain Kirk and an impressive if short space battle. Hoshi in this universe is far more forward, it was great seeing Linda Park play sexy rather than quiet; and it was the highlight of the episode seeing her kill Archer and declare herself Empress at the end.",10
1,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" In a Mirror, Darkly, Part II (TV Episode 2005)",Spectacular,"I am up at an hour which I should be spending sleeping, as I have work in the morning. But I can't take my eyes off of this splendid twist on Enterprise. I love this series, though I have to say, this alternate universe two part episode is fantastic. Seeing Jonathan Archer as a power hungry, and equally driven character is something I was skeptical about, upon first reading the ""info"" on the episode before watching, but it plays beautifully. Likewise, the twist on the other characters, Most notably, Dr. Flocks, and Tucker, are played well. The ability to play both sides of the fence goes to show that these three actors do their job well. Travis, T'pol and Reid Aren't as memorable in their twisted states, though I am not so sure why. T'pol doesn't seem to have changed much other than her outfit, and displays a bit more emotion than one would expect from a Vulcan, Reid just seems to be a sinister little twerp that we don't care about, and Travis is basically the same...Following orders with nothing really too interesting going on about him to grab our attention. it was very nice to see the crew step aboard the Defiant and to see the insides of that old Star Trek style ship come to life again.**SPOLIER BELOW**The ending was somewhat enexpected, as usually in Enterprise the good triumph over the bad, Archers demise was unexpected to me as well, and as for Hoshi...She makes a damn sexy Empress.All in all I give these two episodes a ten out of ten.

I can only wish that Enterprise had not been cancelled, as this story line was ripe for continuation- Empress Hoshi has a nice ring to it, and seeing the next step in her takeover of the Terran Empire was an episode all unto itself. once again i say the previous review is pathetic, written by someone in love with being controversial for no reason other that to attract attention to them instead of the show- WATCH In a Mirror Darkly for yourself- don't let this dweeb steer you away from one of the finest moments of the series!!!",10

4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" In a Mirror, Darkly, Part II (TV Episode 2005)",Can we get back to the show now?,"Some very good reflections of the original Star Trek here. I enjoyed the familiar costumes and sound effects. However I didn't like this alternate universe any more than I did the other ones. Enterprise had a great story-line and group of characters without this contrived gimmick that has been done over and over. It was a good show, cancelled way too soon. And by the way, if the women have to run around half naked, how about doing the same with the men. Us ladies could use some eye candy too if it's going to stoop to that level. In my opinion, they wasted two episodes of the little time the show had left on this. My two least favorite of the entire Star Trek: Enterprise series.",4

TNG had ""Relics"", DS9 had ""Trials and Tribble-ations"" , VOY gave us ""Flashback"" and for the 700th episode of live action Star Trek ever aired Enterprise gives us ""In A Mirror, Darkly"". This tale is a cleverly written continuity barrage that gives fans a high quality and thoroughly enjoyable mirror episode.""In A Mirror, Darkly"" is widely credited as one of the best episodes of Enterprise, and it is easy to see why. There are so many interesting homages to the original series and seeing our 22nd century crew hamming it up makes this two-parter a worthy investment of your time. Star Trek fans will be delighted to see a myriad of references to TOS. Whether it is seeing a Constitution class ship getting a CGI upgrade and strutting its stuff or Soval sporting his ""evil Vulcan goatee"" there is something here for everyone to enjoy. The story is a little heavy handed with the evil versions of our characters, but that does not detract from the overall enjoyment of it. Despite being set in the mirror universe, this episode gives us a reflection on our prime universe in the way of presenting the xenophobia of the humans which becomes a major plot point in the two episodes that follow this one. From the opening teaser to the rise of newly crowned Empress Sato, ""In A Mirror, Darkly"" is a superb episode that is a fun and entertaining ride that leaves fans wishing Enterprise had stuck around for a few more seasons.",8
6,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" In a Mirror, Darkly, Part II (TV Episode 2005)",Power Plays & A Mirror Universe,"In its final season on air, the Star Trek prequel series Enterprise finally found its feet. Under a new show runner, the series finally became the prequel series it was originally pitched as being. It explored and tied-in with many aspects of Trek's lore. One of the most exciting moments of that came as the show was beginning to wind down prematurely. In A Mirror, Darkly brought Enterprise into the Mirror Universe made famous by the Original Series episode Mirror, Mirror and explored throughout Deep Space Nine's run. Picking up from the explosive cliffhanger of part one, the second episode was to take viewers even further into the Mirror Universe's origins.While the first part was set largely on the Mirror Universe version of the NX-01, part two took crew and viewer alike onto a new ship: The Definat, brought over to this universe following the events of the Original Series episode The Tholian Web. The result is that virtually the entirety of the episode is set on a Original Series starship and that we get to see Enterprise's regulars on its decks, its bridge especially. Some of them even up in the familiar uniforms as well, allowing an interesting contrast both in costumes and design from what we're used to. Even more surprising is how great they look, that the designs and costumes hold up well even with a very different crew occupying and wearing them. Add on a fight between Archer and an Original Series alien foe, and it's something that makes this particular episode stand out even more.Like with previous Mirror Universe episodes in Trek, the fun of these episodes is watching the cast members play different versions of familiar characters. One of the biggest surprises come out of Scott Bakula's Archer. Seeing him go from our usual goodhearted starship captain to the somewhat ruthless, passed over one time too many first officer was already a surprise but this episode sees the script and Bakula take this Archer even farther. Confronted by knowledge of his counterpart in a different universe and given a chance not just for command of a ship but potentially the Terran Empire itself, the Mirror Archer becomes an at times reckless gambler who risks not just his life but those of his crew and indeed his new ship to go as far as he can. It's a compelling performance and one that might well be Bakula's finest from the entire run of the series.Then there's Park as Hoshi. Already recast into the Captain's Woman role that we saw Barbara Luna's Marlena play back in Mirror, Mirror but with an updated 21st century edge, Park gets some of the best moments in this episode to herself. This is a Hoshi who isn't the quiet, almost ineffectual communications officer often seen in the series but a conniving, manipulative femme fatale who it turns out isn't afraid to get her hands dirty if need be. Given the writing of Hoshi throughout much of the series, Park getting the chance to sink her teeth into some meatier material is an even bigger revelation than Bakula's Mirror Archer. They aren't alone though. All of the Enterprise regulars get some interesting moments in this episode though some get more than others. Jolene Blalock's T'Pol is a big highlight of this episode as, in keeping with the way the Mirror Spock was portrayed, we're given a more conniving Vulcan than we're used to which leads to some wonderful confrontations between T'Pol and Archer, and indeed between T'Pol and Hoshi as well. Plus, as with Vaughan Armstron's Forest in the first episode, we get to see a reoccurring character in a different role with Gary Graham's Vulcan Soval who goes from an ambassador in the normal universe to a science officer on one of the Empire's ships but whom gets some a couple of interesting scenes as well with T'Pol. Sadly, like in the previous episode, Anthony Montgomery and Conner Trinneer end up being shuffled to the back proverbially speaking, they get some screen-time that shows just enough of their Mirror counterparts to wet appetites. The writing and direction are also among Enterprise's finest. Both Mike Sussman (who wrote the previous episode as well) and director Marvin V. Rush picks up on the energy from the cliffhanger and run with it, quickly picking up the threads and taking them farther than what might have been possible in just forty-five minutes. The second episode takes the hints and references from the first and expands them into a tale of power plays on personal and cosmic scales, building up to an immensely satisfying conclusion that manages to take the viewer by surprise (or at least it did me on my first viewing). Combined with a first rate action score by Dennis McCarthy and Kevin Kiner and some of the show's better CGI set piece battles, the result is one of Enterprise's finest productions.The end result is one of Enterprise's best episodes. Going straight off the previous episode, it manages to contrast in somewhat with an incredible recreation of an Original Series era starship as well as its costumes. Beyond the production, it also tells an interesting story with plenty of suspense and action. The ending leaves the viewer begging for more and it's just a shame that the proposed follow-up never happened due to the show's cancellation. It also shows what the series could accomplish at its best as both a Trek prequel and as a series in its own right.",8
7,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" In a Mirror, Darkly, Part II (TV Episode 2005)",Archer Gets a Bit Greedy,"In the second part of ""In a Mirror, Darkly"", Archer is able to take control of the Defiant, stealing from the Tholian docks. The Enterprise is destroyed with Forrest still aboard but the Defiant is able to retrieve some of the rescue pods. But there appears to be a stowaway aboard, left over from when the Defiant was being scrapped in dry dock. The crew finds out it is a Gorn. An exciting hunt involving Reed, Archer, and some MACO's happens before Archer cleverly uses the gravity plates to trap and kill the Gorn.Now as acting captain, Archer takes the Defiant to go assist the ISS Avenger as it is being attacked by a group of rebels. Archer orders the destruction of a Vulcan ship (much to the dismay of T'Pol) and is the hero of the fight. Aboard the Avenger is Admiral Black, a high ranking officer, who orders Archer to take the Defiant to Earth where it can be studied and dissected. Wanting to maintain his command, Archer kills Black and begins planning a coup against the Empire. He demands Star Fleet to surrender.T'Pol sees the writing on the wall for her people and convinces her fellow non-Terrans that they need to stop Archer and the Defiant before he rises to the role of emperor. Her and Soval recruit Phlox to cut the power from the vessel. It works temporarily but Trip is able to stop him in time and re-energize the Defiant. It destroys the Avenger with everyone aboard. The counter-coup is defeated and Archer heads towards Earth to claim his prize. But you are never safe in this universe. Hoshi poisons his champagne with the help of Travis. She claims the role of empress and arrives at Earth demanding Star Fleet's surrender.Oh boy are people ruthless in this mirror universe! Everyone will do anything to climb to the throne. Interestingly, T'Pol still feels like a bit of a peacekeeper. She attempts to make the Federation a thing in her universe as well, causing Archer to destroy the ship's historical logs and erasing any reference to the universe we're familiar with. I guess Spock has a similar personality later on in this universe.I wonder if Archer would have been so power-hungry if he hadn't read about his counterpart who was the first warp 5 starship captain. This may have ended up leading to his ultimate demise. Hoshi saw an opportunity to rule and she took it.But this really is a stellar episode, an excellent standalone two-parter. The action is exciting, everything feels high stakes as they kill of memorable characters left and right (well, mirror characters), and the constant betrayals and tactical mind games make this a fun ride to the finish. I wonder how the rule of Empress Sato went...",9
8,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" In a Mirror, Darkly, Part II (TV Episode 2005)",I really liked this one!!!,"This is the second part of a wonderful two-parter. While I loved the original ""Mirror, Mirror"" episode from the old ""Star Trek"", this evil parallel universe was way, way overused in some of the subsequent Trek spin-offs. At first I liked it when the crew of Deep Space 9 was visited by these evil parallel doubles but after so many follow-ups, it became way overused. What I loved about ""Mirror, Mirror"" was its originality. Fortunately, in ""Star Trek: Enterprise"", they managed to use the old concept but infuse it with wonderful originality and life. I think this two-parter is in the must see category for fans.In the previous episode, Archer orchestrated a mutiny in order to try to steal a ship that was somehow stolen from the future. With it, he planned on taking over the evil empire and being its evil emperor. However, in part two, there were some hiccups, including a Gorn aboard the stolen ship that was trying to disable the vessel as well as the machinations of the evil and often disloyal crew. Can Archer manage to rule this awful parallel universe?!This episode has so much going for it. Like part one, the normal intro for the show is replaced by an evil intro--complete with martial music and clips of war and violence! It also did NOT feature nice beings from our universe--just very, very bad ones from theirs. It was NOT like the nice Trekkie folks getting stuck there but as if it was a show intended for an evil audience to enjoy! It also featured a deliciously evil ending--with no redemption, no nice ending and just more of the awfulness that make this parallel world fun to watch. My only complaint is a minor one--why make a CGI Gorn when the CGI quality was that poor and obviously fake? I really think the original ""Star Trek"" Gorn looked better!!",10

Anyway, it's a rapid fire episode with lots of action, twists, and turns. The aliens are suddenly targeted as the enemies. They have a right to defend their turf. Then they fall under the same delusions as everyone else. I guess the question we need to ask is whether or not there is any good in this universe? There is certainly a ""Game of Thrones"" vibe to all of this, although it predicted that serious. Even the music at the beginning has a little bit of that.

It was painful to watch, especially Archer, who looked particularly constipated, as if he had a ghost of an idea he wanted to evoke but fruitlessly strained to get it out there.Aside from that, the fact that such a back stabbing organization could never survive made the whole thing was a pointless exercise.That said, it was incredibly cool seeing the old ship and uniforms again, and hearing the musical effects of the old bridge.

Dr. Phlox investigates the DNA of the hair three times and concludes that it belongs to a daughter of Tip and T'Pol; however, T'Pol objects telling that she has never been pregnant. Archer presses Nathan to disclose the investigation of the murder and he finds that the deceased woman is Susan Khouri, a medical attendant that belonged to the xenophobic organization Terra Prime.

By 2155, Earth has appeared to have solved its racism issue but it has replaced its xenophobia of other human races for that of other species.I found it humorous that Trip & T'Pol thought they could infiltrate this group undetected. They are two high ranking officers on the ship that saved the planet. They're world famous I presume! They are not the two that should have gone undercover. This episode shows a lot of parallels with modern society. As globalization continues to bring the world closer together, people tend to push back against others that are slightly different than them, externalizing their problems against them.

The woman had been involved with a xenophobic group called Terra Prime and tests on her body suggested that she had been living in a low gravity environment, the most likely location being on the Moon where there is a lot of anti alien feeling, Trip and T'Pol head there to try to find their daughter.

Following this threat the words '... to be continued' appear.This was a decent episode starring Peter 'Robocop' Weller as Paxton; he gave the character a suitable mix of authority and charisma. Johanna Watts put in a good performance as the beautiful Gannet Brooks who used her past with Travis to gain access to Enterprise to spy for Terra Prime.

Peter Weller is yet another reactionary Meathead Sean Hannity-type who has done some very bad things.Harry Groener from TNG ""Tin Man"" is a future politician, ""Nathan Samuels"", who used to be a member of the Xenophobic Group ""Terra Prime"". which is a lame future version of the lame ""America First"".As Samuels tries to preside over a meeting of ambassadors from several planets, the Brietbart of the future has been soapbox- spouting, and people eating it up because of, of course, the Xindi wiped out 7 million people. Isil hasn't quite caught up with that yet, although Germany surpassed it previously, and people forget that Nazism started with Xenophobia. Then came the Deportation forces and the Concentration camps.So, this preliminary meeting of the ""UFP"" does not bode well, because of this Breitbart style Xenophobia spreading. Phlox had been targeted during ""Home"" by a redneck in a bar.Other things that didn't help much were a woman appearing and dying in front of everyone from a Disruptor blast, cryptically saying ""They are gonna kill 'her'"", whoever 'her' is.And then it appears that Starfleet Security wants to shovel it all under the carpet. Archer finds a way around it, and Malcolm must needs meet his ""Section 31"" associate once more.This 'Sode is a bunch of puzzle pieces being creatively put together, and it's marvelous.

The various future members of this organization have come to Earth to formalize this agreement when a group of xenophobic nuts derail the dream. What is their qualm? They want the human race to be pure--not adulterated by ugly alien genes--and the evidence of this ugliness is a hybrid baby--the love child of T'Pol and Trip. But how? They never had a baby?! However, their agenda involves MUCH more than showing everyone a freaky alien hybrid baby...they aim to destroy the negotiations and drive all the aliens off Earth using a super-weapon.The leaders of the baddies is ably played by Peter Weller. He's menacing, nasty and cold. My only reason for giving the show a 7 is that the whole hybrid baby plot line never really made sense nor seemed necessary. Fortunately, part two is better.",7

I absolutely adored ""Terra Prime"" and ""Demons""; it was beautiful; the relationship between Trip and T'Pol and even with their daughter. This would have made a much, much better series finale, in my opinion, than ""These Are the Voyages..."" First of all, it made me cry. Okay, I cried during at least three of the Star Trek movies and during ""Home"", but that last scene where Trip approaches T'Pol in her quarters... Oh!! Sad!! Very, very emotionally moving.There were a lot of memorable lines and moments here. It was one of those really unforgettable episodes. Splendid; splendid. I would have loved to see the series move on from here, especially considering the (doubtless) trauma that impacted our favourite Enterprise couple.(By the way, for anyone who would have loved to see this go on, I suggest reading ""The Good That Men Do"" by Andy Mangels and Michael A.

Well, as any true Star Trek Enterprise i will consider this particular episode as being the last. It is also the best. I can truly say i will miss this series, especially since the relationship between Trip and T'Pol has had a very beautiful development toward a future together.

3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Terra Prime (TV Episode 2005)",Enterprise hits a home run on it's way out.,"In the beginning...In 2001, I started to watch the series Enterprise because something about the concept intrigued me. I had not gotten into The Next Generation, and I was too busy for DS9. I watched the re-runs of the Original Series when I was a kid, and that was the appeal that led me to Enterprise.Enterprise debuted around the same time the 9/11 terrorists attacks came. Although the show had been planned months ahead of time, and was hyped throughout the summer of 2001, the show had the misfortune of bad bad timing. Anyone who watches Enterprise now, and wasn't alive or old enough back then probably can't imagine how big of a change that was for even someone such as myself - who at the time taught students how to file forms for government services. But the whole world stopped, and there was little time for the distractions of fictionalized TV. Some of these episodes were canceled, and broadcast during the wee hours of the night. Some came during very important war announcements.Sometime in late November 2001, a friend who had started watching Enterprise in the beginning as I had, asked if I was able to keep up. When I said that I wasn't, he informed me that UPN - the now defunct network that broadcast the show - was going to air a marathon to get viewers up to speed. I then told my friend that I would forgo the show for its original run, and watch it during its re-run period, because there was no way to get back into it, and judge it fairly.""And,"" I said, ""this show is going to have a hard time showcasing Science for Peace when most of America is suffering from a blood-lust.""What I didn't know is that those re-runs would never come...Earlier this year, though, I had a chance to go through the whole series on Amazon Prime. I wasn't impressed. The first two years of the series were a mess. The characters were ill-defined, and sloppily utilized. The situations were banal. And, from the stories that were presented, the writers' interest in science was small.The third season was at least coherent. The writers gained an interest in some science - the science of war. The Enterprise characters gained characterizations. And - finally! - there was a reason for Trip.But it was the fatal fourth season that turned in the best episodes. And none better than Terra Prime.The science dilemma of the show is how science advancements leave people behind. Don't just assume that the victims of advancements are the villains, such as the xenophobe John Frederick Paxton. No, everyone gets victimized for the furtherment of science: from Capt. Archer in DEMONS, the first part of this two episode story; to the very sad exploitation of T'Pol and Trip.Yes, science is a tool that can be used for good or bad. This was the tale of those got stomped by it.It's a pity that it took Enterprise four years to come up with a great Sci-Fi story.(And can you believe they came up with one of the worst televised shows ever in the next installment?)",8
4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Terra Prime (TV Episode 2005)","The real Series Finale and a dire warning for 2017, which was ignored.","""These are the fantasy TNG Holodeck Voyages"", I don't consider it as part of this show even, it was Braga's final failed attempt to make one more TNG Ep. So from now on I ignore it. That episode should NEVER have been made. To Blazes with Braga, because of him, many talented people lost their jobs. I'd rather see the cast and crew doing what they are best at: Making TREK shows, rather than remembering Trek shows at Conventions.I had dismissed and panned this show, mostly cos of the canon- breaking writing and too-human Vulcanians. Imagine the head of the Vulcanian government in collusion with Romulans and acting like one himself? The excess emotions and bombing a sacred temple with people in it not a big enough CLUE? I could not swallow the multiple 24th century anachronisms, the multiplex time paradoxes, although the one on ""Carpenter"" Street"" in Season 3 was great. I thought T'Pol sucked, but that was before I knew she had been exposed to a toxic emotion- causing Trellium-D Overdose. Now that I can see the progression of her Character, Jolene did a swell job at playing a Vulcan on the deteriorating side.So, I had mostly ignored Enterprise all these years. But that was MY Bad. After Binge Watching the whole show just now, there are many good things about it. ""Is it Star Trek?"" YES. And this episode here, and the one prior to it, are the appropriate Series Finales this show deserved.Season 4 was quite a bit different. It was made during the great ""Change"" - Shows no longer had 26 Eps per season, like Enterprise 1st 2 seasons. Season 3 got 24 Eps and season 4, only 22. But those 22 were not individual episodes, but rather little 2-3 Ep vignettes, which propelled the story toward THIS Ep.I had trouble with ""Arik Soong"" and his Mulleted ""Arguments"" I like to call them, and I had a lot of trouble with the ""Vulcanians with Testosterone"" Eps. But even those had some good things and some great story elements.But these last 2 Eps, which are the actual season and series finale, reflect the crappy things that are happening in the US this year, Xenophobia has made it into the White House. These episodes were merely a warning made during the last time we had a reactionary governing us, people forget that this country was almost destroyed that time too. How fast can 8 years of forward progress be eradicated?So it is best to remember this episode: And also the fact that most decent people in this country won't put up with what John Frederick Paxton (Peter Weller) and the Xenophobe in the White House are pushing.Ironically, this is not the first time Peter Weller plays a reactionary Meathead in Trek, he was a similar Meathead in ""Into Darkness"". In Fiction, the reactionaries get their just desserts. Sometimes, they get what they deserve in real life, too.",10
5,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Terra Prime (TV Episode 2005)",This episode embodies everything Star Trek represents,"This episode is the Enterprise series finale for me; I cannot and will not recognize the abortion that is named ""These are the Voyages"".This is the second part of a story about a hypocrite that capitalizes on the fears of humans as earth enters the interstellar community.This episode embodies everything Trek represents. It is a heart tugging story about diversity and self exploration. Through the heroic actions of our crew, Humans, Vulcans, Andorians, Tellarites, Denobulans, Rigelians and Coridanites are discussing the formation of an alliance and Archer is called upon to address the representatives.ARCHER: ""Up until about a hundred years ago, there was one question that burned in every human, that made us study the stars and dream of traveling to them, Are we alone? Our generation is privileged to know the answer to that question. We are all explorers, driven to know what's over the horizon, what's beyond our own shores. And yet, the more I've experienced, the more I've learned that no matter how far we travel, or how fast we get there, the most profound discoveries are not necessarily beyond that next star. They're within us, woven into the threads that bind us, all of us, to each other. The final frontier begins in this hall. Let's explore it together!""Then you have the background of T'Pol, whom had professed her feelings for Trip and Trip sharing those feelings then staying away. Then the two of them, Vulcan and Human, brought together because the epitome of a ""anti IDIC human"" like Paxton, using the fire of xenophobia, created Elizabeth for the sole purpose of isolating humanity from the newly found diverse community of aliens. A helpless, completely unaware, innocent little Elizabeth, with no understanding of her importance or control of her fate, ends up being the magnet that led to Paxton's demise and the reunification of Trip and T'Pol. T'Pol's very simple line while holding her emotions at bay as Trip struggles to contain his, holding the Vulcan IDIC given to her by her mother ""She was important"" symbolizes the very heart of Trek - Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combination. This episode speaks not only to the exploration of space, but to inner exploration and tolerance and calls for all to put aside our petty differences and join together.Season 4's finest.",10
6,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Terra Prime (TV Episode 2005)",A tragedy for T'Pol and Trip,"The second part of this two-part story begins with T'Pol and Trip still in Paxton's captivity on Mars. He has issued a threat to Star Fleet that he will destroy their headquarters if all aliens have not departed from Earth within a couple of days. Archer is ordered to destroy the array but he believes there is a way to re-take it without costing the lives of the people living there. To do this he and a team from Enterprise will have to avoid detection by flying behind a comet in a shuttle. This would be difficult at the best of time without the shuttle being sabotaged. Luckily for all aboard Travis is a good pilot. They manage to retake the facility and save Star Fleet but sadly they can't save T'Pol and Trip's baby; Paxton's cloning technology was flawed so the baby was doomed from the start.This was another fine episode with a good guest performance from Peter Weller as Paxton. Another notable performance was from Jolene Blalock who managed to show both emotion and restraint as T'Pol when her baby died. The action was fairly exciting even if the special effects for the scene with the shuttle flying behind the comet weren't too convincing. It was brave to end on a sad note with the baby dying after the success they'd had at the conference right up until we were actually told she was dead I was convinced Dr. Phlox would come in and announce he'd found a cure, it wasn't to be though.",9
7,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Terra Prime (TV Episode 2005)","""Your not only a terrorist, you're a hypocrite.""","The ""Terra Prime"" episodes are a fitting, prescient, concluding commentary on American society from 2008-2020. The Terra Prime organization is a glove-like fit to the current Marxist Party of Hate that fosters an apocalyptic revulsion of conservative Americans. While the Terra Prime people use weapons of mass destruction to achieve their xenophobic goals, the Party of Hate uses its Brownshirt thugs to attack patriots and destroy American culture by burning books, shutting down free speech, and destroying monuments. ""War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength,"" shout the Brownshirt terrorist hypocrites!
""We've seen what humans can be at their worst,"" says Nathan Samuels.Beginning with TOS, the writers tried to comment on social issues, and by accident they nailed it in this two-parter. It even contains the mandatory white-woman-lusting-after-a-black-man. (It's never a black woman desiring a white man.)Even so, I believe this Star Trek franchise series has the most dislikable crew of all of them. Yeah, McCoy was irritating with his whining, but Enterprise has an arrogant, narcissistic, hot-tempered jock for a captain; a hot-tempered good 'ol Floda boy for a chief engineer, a whiney communications officer, and a seedy, whiney British tactical officer.",10

In it, Enterprise must sneak into the compound on Mars of the nut-case (Peter Weller) who is threatening to destroy the Federation before it can begin. In other words, while the humans and their new alien friends are about to sign a treaty forming the Federation, this idiot plans on destroying all this due to his xenophobic dream!Part two focuses on the infiltration of the compound and then setting the wheels in motion for the Federation. Each was accomplished well and in an exciting fashion. Because of this, it makes a fine addition to the Trek franchise--well worth seeing and Weller makes an excellent baddie.",9
9,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Terra Prime (TV Episode 2005)",Enterprise's Series Finale (Sort Of),"In ""Terra Prime"", Paxton gives his ultimatum for aliens to leave Earth, threatening to destroy Star Fleet headquarters if no one complies. Trip & T'Pol meet their child. Paxton forces Trip to help calibrate the weapon. Archer, Reed, Travis, and Phlox piggyback off a comet to sneak onto the Mars surface undetected. They storm Paxton's operation and rescue Trip, T'Pol, and the baby. Paxton is able to deploy the weapon but Trip's recalibrated it to fire harmlessly into the ocean. The clone baby of T'Pol & Trip has genetic issues and dies as the episode draws to a close. They name it Elizabeth in honor of Trip's sister. Archer gives a rousing speech at the conference, motivating the reluctant parties to form the alliance after all. I'm watching the entirety of the Star Trek-verse in chronological order (shout out to the Star Trek Chronology Project website). Viewed this way, this is basically the series finale of Star Trek: Enterprise (""In a Mirror"" & ""These Are Voyages"" come much later, after TOS, so I'm skipping those for now). In this respect, this episode kind of works as a sendoff to the series. We tidy up all the lose ends: the Federation is moving forward thanks to the crew of the Enterprise, T'Pol & Trip's will they/won't they romance seems to be official now, the Earth has been saved once again. There aren't any obvious open plot lines that don't get resolved. The plot of the episode itself isn't exactly mind blowing but, like I said, it does its job. I'm actually a bit sad to be leaving ST:E, which is something I never thought I'd say. I've really grown attached to its characters, mainly Phlox, T'Pol, and Trip. I still think Bacula as Archer is a terrible character but the rest of the cast kind of makes up for this. Even Hoshi, my least favorite for most of the series, had really begun to grow on me in the latter seasons. It's a shame that the show got canceled just as it was beginning to hit its stride.",7

Nothing more was needed.Please never touch anything Trek related again before you completely destroy the franchise.Pathetic.",1
2,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" These Are the Voyages... (TV Episode 2005)","Berman & Braga say ""Screw you, Trekkies!""","Easily the most unsatisfying end-of-series episode I have ever seen, ""These Are the Voyages"" was nonetheless an appropriate send-off for ""Enterprise"" in that it was, like much of the series, full of unrealized potential.There was no reason to wrap the whole story, set some six years after the fourth season's events, in a ridiculous ""Next Generation"" plot based on a minor seventh-season TNG story, ""The Pegasus."" It was distracting to see Frakes and Sirtis trying to look relevant (and struggling not to look old and fat) in their younger characters, after we had seen so much greater growth over the course of several feature films. The idea of play-acting on the holodeck for several days (don't you have some actual WORK to do, Commander?) as an effective way to reach a decision was embarrassing. I wanted to shake him: ""Man up, Riker!"" What was the most annoying aspect of the movie ""Star Trek V: The Final Frontier"" (aside from the aging crew shoe-horned into their uniforms and an insipid plot)? The idea that ""Oh, did I forget to mention all these years that I have a brother?"" And yet that kind of ""conveniently forgotten"" fact is exactly what they did here. Suddenly, the ship's cook (yes the COOK) is a major player, everybody's buddy, and privy to more information than a bridge officer. For the whole series, they've treated this guy like a combination of ""Tim the Toolman Taylor's"" over-the-fence neighbor that you never actually see, and DS9's Morn, whom you never hear. So from whence comes this idea that ""Chef"" (he doesn't even get a name?) was the confidant of every person on board? Seems like something that might have been mentioned at SOME point in the last four years. The series finale is a bit late to stuff in a point like that, guys.Bad as the idea was of having these guest stars cluttering up the story, other facets of the episode seemed less oversight or poor judgment than deliberate slaps in the face. One of the most poignant points of any show is the death of a major character; in the Star Trek universe, this is exemplified by the deaths of Spock, Kirk, and Data in the feature films, each of which was an emotional climax of their respective movie. Yet Troi is given a line that completely ruins this, telling the viewers a good 20 minutes ahead of time that Tripp Tucker is going to die.Annoying as the questions around Tucker's death are (blowing up a compartment was his BEST idea? Had Shran really left or not? Where the hell were the MACOs?) it was the death scene itself that was worst. Why? Because there WASN'T a death scene! Gravely injured, Tucker is rushed into a chamber in sickbay. We break for commercial to watch several minutes of ads for toilet paper and Big Macs, and then come back to find Archer and T'Pol in Tripps quarters. It's only after a minute or so of dialog that it is confirmed for the viewer that he has died! If I were Conner Trinneer, I would fire the agent that let me get cheated like that. The only ones cheated more were the fans.Finally, the last scene of the last episode of the last Star Trek TV series arrives. It's Archer's speech, the speech that he has been thinking about the whole episode, the speech that marks the foundation of the Federation, the speech that frikkin' Troi had to memorize in grade school, for pete's sake! This should be good, stirring stuff, full of Horatio Hornblower and starry eyes, a cherry on top of a lackluster series, one last chance for the writers to redeem themselves for four years of hackery that almost ended the 40-year run of Star Trek. And what does Riker say? ""Computer, end program."" Fade out, steal Shatner's monologue, roll credits.If Berman and Braga hadn't screwed up so much in this series, after doing much the same with BOTH ""Star Trek: Insurrection"" and ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" the franchise might well have been kept out of the disrespectful hands of J.J. Abrams and his 2010 ""re-imagining"" of the Star Trek saga. Let us hope that B&B will never again be allowed near it.",1

(TV Episode 2005)",Stinks of Berman and Braga,"After two years of noble efforts to save ""Enterprise"" by its writers, the murderers of this franchise, Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, return to write the series finale to a show that was on its way to following the path of The Next Generation---an abysmal start with its first two seasons, and a sudden sharp rise in quality starting with the third season.Instead, Enterprise was essentially dead by season 2, and the damage was irreversible, even as the quality of episodes reached even levels of certain TNG episodes in terms of impact and quality.Even without the obvious point if this technically being a story stolen by TNG Riker and Troi, the script stinks, STINKS, of the same tired, stupid tropes Berman and Braga littered the first two seasons with, with stupid meta-references dropped like ""Here's to the Next Generation"" and ""All good things..."", or one-dimensional characterizations like ""I'm a Vulcan; I don't miss people"" which goes COMPLETELY AGAINST what'd been occurring for the past year's worth of episodes, or droning, repetitive statements of ""I never thought Vulcans and Andorians would work together!"" again despite EVERYTHING that'd been occurring for the PAST YEAR'S worth of episodes, and PAINFULLY unsubtle remarks by characters.Like a typical Berman and Braga script, along with the stupid dialogue and shallow comments and characterization, there are tons of unfunny jokes, a story featuring random ALIENS OF THE WEEK that are so blatantly evil and one-dimensional, it feels almost insulting that even Commander Tucker, a guy who would normally rank among the lowest of notable Star Trek characters if not for his relationship with T'Pol making him a real character, dies while killing a bunch of these arbitrary idiots.It's a death rather like Tasha Yar's; killed by some random alien that will never have any effect in Trek history ever again, for pretty much no reason.There literally is no story. Enterprise is on its way for Archer to sign the treaty that creates the Federation when Shrann appears, apparently having faked his own death for whatever reason, and forces Archer to help him rescue his daughter from pirates or whatever. They save her, and the pirates find Enterprise and board it, only for Tucker to suicide bomb them. The rest involves Riker and Troi with the Pegasus thing, and a decision Riker has to make which, for the life of me, I absolutely cannot remember or even care about.Riker...I wish I were exaggerating when I say that Riker's (or Troi's) presence is like a hammer smash to the face, completely DESTROYING all the immersion and drama of a scene, reminding you that ""HEY, this is all a holographic illusion with a surprisingly old and fat Riker standing around looking horribly out of place watching it all"". He's always just THERE, for no good reason other than to diminish Enterprise for the sake of what couldn't even be considered a SUBPLOT for a TNG episode.TNG's finale was hardly ""final"", as they knew they were going to make movies to continue the franchise. Deep Space Nine ended with a bang of a war's conclusion. Even Voyager had a big finale involving technobabbling Voyager home.Aside from the end of the holographic story where Enterprise is nonsensically mothballed and the Federation is established, the events in this story can hardly be considered more than filler, made all the more irritating for its pointlessness.The only good part of the episode was the very end, where the famous ""Where No Man/One Has Gone Before"" recitation is done, by all three Enterprise captains, starting with Picard, Kirk, and Archer.Thanks for killing Enterprise, Berman and Braga, and thanks for giving Enterprise a send-off that not only completely squanders everything that was great about the improved Enterprise present JUST IN THE PREVIOUS EPISODE ALONE and squatting out a story not fit even for the Original Series's finale.",1

Going through the other series finales, TOS's Turnabout Intruder, not great but back in the '60s with little or no money it was, as much as can be expected. TNG's All Good Things, mindblowing. The ultimate send off for that show. Not matched since. DS9's what You Leave Behind, brilliant stuff, although left wide open for a sequel that never happened... Voyager, 7 seasons, about ten good episodes. No more to be said. Cop out finale too. But this finale, These Are The Voyages is the stinker of all stinker finales.

The cast of Enterprise is not really present for their own series finale.***The biggest complaint is they kill off Commander Trip Tucker. This is officially the **silliest character death in the history of Star Trek and possibly of all scifi TV** Riker is (supposedly) watching this holoprogram to get insight into his own dilemma about following orders (which he knew were morally wrong) in the Next Gen 7th season episode ""Pegasus"", by watching a ""famous historical example of someone breaking orders for the greater good"".Enterprise is boarded by random alien pirates, who hold Archer and Tucker at gunpoint. Now, let me remind you; Archer being kidnapped by bad aliens was such an overused plot line in seasons 1 and 2 that fans *begged* the show to stop doing that The point is that these guys have been held at gunpoint all the time; what they do is wait for their other crewmembers (remember them?) to rescue them.What happens is that Archer is willing to stay at gunpoint, but Tucker says he wants to try something, as Archer is getting punched. Archer shouts that he ""orders"" Trip not to try anything, but Trip ""breaks orders"" by doing it anyway: he tells the alien pirates that he will put them in communication with the bridge, leads them over to a maintenance panel, then intentionally misconnects two power cables in his hands, to cause a massive explosion that kills himself and the pirates, thus saving Archer. That's it.My questions are; 1) Why would Tucker suddenly do something (like causing an EXPLOSION) which he knew would definitely kill himself, when he's been in random hostage situations MANY TIMES during the course of the series? 2) **HOW WAS THIS IN ANY WAY AN ""ORDER""???*** Riker's ""breaking of orders"" dilemma was that he had been ordered by a corrupt admiral not to tell anyone that the Federation was conducting secret weapons experiments in direct violation of international treaties, but he felt this was wrong and wanted to tell Picard. This was longstanding issue, which he struggled with for several days. This whole situation is NOT COMPARABLE to that! *****In interviews, Connor Trinner, who plays Tucker, basically stated that A) Berman and Braga knew that Tucker was the most popular character on the show and B) essentially realized that there was nothing emotionally involving in the incredibly bad script they had written, so they sank to the lowest common denominator by just killing off a beloved character to get people to ""like"" the ""tear-jerker"" ending. But it's such a forced, obviously scripted death that it was just silly. Many fans hope that a later series will simply explain this away as a hologram error, and that Tucker never died.On top of this, the entire episode is centered around Archer having to give a speech at the signing of the Federation charter: struggling with what to write, etc. The final scene is of him walking out the door into a forum to give the speech, then ***Riker says ""computer, end program"" and the whole thing turns off. We never hear the speech, after all of that hype. Not. One. Word. Maybe they were trying to give the idea that it was such a good speech that we could never hear the whole thing, that it was so legendary and good that we should just let our imaginations run wild with how good it was. I can understand not giving the WHOLE thing, but not a single line?! Not a single quote?! For the amount of hype they gave to it (according to them, Tucker killed himself so Archer could deliver this speech on time!) we should have heard something.*****The final shot is of Archer, Kirk, and Picard doing a narration of the ""These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise"" monologue, intercutting with each other as we see the three Enterprises fly by. A lot of casual fans said ""oh, this was a good episode, I liked that montage at the end""....well, it could have been inserted into any given episode, and honestly, did it SERVE THE PLOT IN ANY WAY? Character development, etc? IT WAS A CHEAP TRICK.On top of this, Berman and Braga didn't even THINK of that; they stated that they literally wanted to have Riker say ""Computer, end program"", have him walk out of the holodeck, then fade to black. Credits role. That's it. The end of Star Trek. How these monsters keep getting work, I will never know.That's it. I'm watching Ron D. Moore's Battlestar Galactica now. It's the best scifi show since DS9 went off the air (which, conspicuously, was also the last Star Trek which Moore worked on...). RDM set out with BSG to fix everything about scifi TV that B&B got wrong with the last 7 years of Star Trek; and he did it! Characterization, dark tone, smarter dialog, no Seven of Nines! Ron D. Moore and Battlestar Galactica have inherited the mantle of Scifi television.By your command!",1
7,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" These Are the Voyages... (TV Episode 2005)",Sad ending to a show that deserved better ...,"Truly this is the worst series-ending episode that I can ever recall. ""Forever Knight's"" finale broke my heart, but at least it had some substance. This episode was simply terrible. Perhaps the producers wanted to ensure that they would kill this series once and for all with this episode. Well, they surely did. This show was a disappointment, but did have its moments. Its crew deserved a better send off. I would have preferred for them to be lost forever or assimilated by the Borg instead of being treated like this. It's very sad indeed. I would hope this means that if any other attempts to make a Star Trek series are made that it will have new producers and writers. This effort was truly terrible.",1
8,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" These Are the Voyages... (TV Episode 2005)","Love the series, but the ending just stunk...","I just completed watching Enterprise on Netflix. I have to say as a long time Star Trek fan, I was a less than enthralled during the first two seasons, however the final two picked up the pace and I ended up enjoying the way they moved the story along. I particularly liked the cover episode regarding one of the age old Trek questions about how the Klingons from the original series might have developed ridges by the time the movies were made... at any rate.. the finale for Enterprise was lame on several counts, some of which have already been talked about. I don't have a problem so much with them bridging into the TNG... but it was a little too much of that and not enough closure for the series. Killing off a character is always expected.. but Tripp's death was just lame and Troi spoiling it early sort of lamer. Not allowing the series to end with the Captain's speech to the delegates was also sort of lame.. sort of short cheated the Captain Archer legacy... I have to think that this was thrown together once they knew the series was not going to be renewed.. at any rate, its too bad it ended where it did, because I think it was just starting to get good. It would have made more sense to try and bring the story as close to the roots of the Original series time line as they could in a bridge than to do what they did...",4
9,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" These Are the Voyages... (TV Episode 2005)",Pathetic Finale,What an insult. While Enterprise was not as good or popular as TNG the decision to base the last episode of Enterprise around two stars from another show was a blatant insult to the cast of Enterprise who were not at fault for their show not being as good writing wise as the others. I was insulted and appalled and time has not diluted that feeling. It was decisions like this that lead to Enterprise being less popular than the others. I strongly recommend you run away from this episode full speed ahead. As a whole Enterprise the series has some good episodes mixed in. Best bet pretend Terra Prime is the series finale and pretend this one doesn't exist.,1
10,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" These Are the Voyages... (TV Episode 2005)",Yes... It really was that bad!!!,"I don't normally post to these type of boards but the finale was so bad, I had to put my two cents in. I can't say I am a die hard trekkie but I started becoming more of a fan with TNG. I was excited about this series until I heard that they cast Bakula as a captain, I thought this was probably a dismal failure to begin with so I never really gave it much of a chance. I didn't want to see the Quantum Leap guy on the bridge. I guess I needed more time to digest it. It wasn't until recently, (2012), that I decided to watched the ""streamed series"" of Enterprise, (hey it's still a new series for me to watch so give me a break! LOL)Overall, I began to grow fond of Scott as a captain, he seemed to settle into the captains chair nicely. To my amazement, I actually enjoyed all the crew and their traits seemed to fit them well. In my opinion, this franchise was lost in season 4 and I blame the writers. Somewhere around the episode with the orion women things started falling apart. You can tell it even in the crews acting that they were not thrilled with how things were going.The whole Xindi season was stellar, it's too bad they couldn't do the same for season 4 and arc another big mission of an entire season.Season four was a waste of streaming bandwidth. And then... the final episode... OMG!I always loved Riker and Troi but they should have never been cast to this episode. Look, we are all getting older, and I rather remember these two as young heros. Troi, well.... she's still got it but they made her up way too heavy. Riker... I love ya man but we both put on some weight and some wrinkles over the years. The least they could have done was get you a new TNG uniform that fit you versus stuffing you in the same one you use to use back in the 80's. Also, a little Just For Men wouldn't have hurt either. This was not how I want to remember my TNG heros.I get the fact that the season came to an abrupt end, but the whole deal being packaged the way it was, in my opinion, did a huge discredit the entire NX-01 crew/actors. A holodeck program? Killing Trip? A large #1 with a side of Troi? WTF, when did they ever mention that they confide in the chef?I would have rather seen the crew of Enterprise be the focal point and not stand in the shadows of the TNG stars. If they needed to whip out a finale, they should have taken clips and mixed them in with interviews of the enterprise actors, funniest moments, etc. At least that would have been an appropriate send off.Nothing but love for the entire cast of Enterprise. You got a raw deal in the end and every knows it. Thanks for a great show while it lasted.",1
11,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" These Are the Voyages... (TV Episode 2005)",If History Serves to Remind,"Never post to internet, what you don't want haunting you, forever. That statement also has a prequel.Never put together a series finale, where fans still roil in pain at its mentioning decades later.So where we are, nearly a decade after the finale of this flawed but curiously interesting series?Still furious, still steaming. And wishing we could execute Shatner's imperative, to ""get a life"" beyond Trek.In short, if this finale was a B and B ""Valentine"" to the fans, consider what might happen if you showed up on Valentine's day with a vacuum cleaner as a gift in lieu of flowers. Would it not be a disaster you'd never get over, never hear the end of no matter how much time has passed? Well, here we are!How bad was this finale? I hope they end the series with Blu-Ray 4th Season at Terra Prime, and isolate this last episode into some ""Epilogue"" extra with lots of mea culpa secondary tracts by B and B and the cast--of the original Enterprise. As to this episode, what utter betrayal to both artists and fans.During the four year run I got past the totally inappropriate theme music, the titillation of a Spock with boobs, another heavily accented engineer, the counter McCoy smiley Doc Phlox - as arcs in the last year were getting interestingly past alien of the week. Much has been correctly made of the marginalization of the entire cast and crew by framing this episode, nay, entire series, inside a holodeck dream TNG sequence overseen by middle aged, chubby Riker sporting Shatner's old hairpiece.What was the throwaway death of Trip about? So Archer could make a meeting on time? What a B and B sop to studio execs and their meetings, why folks would sacrifice lives to have their leaders make one! All that build up to a speech never recited! All the hope between Trip/T'Pal dashed.Certainly real life doesn't work happily ever after, there's real tragedy, folks die, people move on. But our fiction, however dark, is more a place where we like to imbue closure and what the world should look like. Even ""Lost"" had folks dieing happily ever after and many of us thought that ending was tripe and pandering. But this Enterprise finale plot goes down in history, as the Dallas dream sequence that brought back brother Bobby to the living did, as one of the off putting in TV history. I mirror Blalock's comments. ""Crap"". ""Appalling"". It marginalized everyone by reducing them to stand ins on a TNG holodeck. It was as if B and B were saying, OK, we struggled with these plot lines, but you didn't support us with a big enough fan base to make this commercially successful, we'll get you for that. We'll show you. For investing in these characters, our last lines will be ""it's only a dream, it isn't ""real"". That'll fix ya!Yup. Just a dream. But some nightmares haunt forever.",1
12,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" These Are the Voyages... (TV Episode 2005)",insulting,"This episode was an insult to the very spirit of Star Trek, not to mention the cast of Star Trek: Enterprise itself. I don't know what Berman and Braga were thinking when they wrote this episode. I don't know whether they thought it would actually read as a proper send-off to the series. I am not them. What I do know is that the entire episode reeked of a hastily constructed ""screw you!"" to the fans. Over the course of the hour most of the plot development established over the series is completely torn apart and replaced with an insane ""watch Johnathan Frakes try REALLY HARD to look 20 years younger!"" variety show where the cast of Enterprise comes in one by one to talk to him about their problems.And did I mention that the story was completely insipid? No? Well, it was. It might have made a cute episode of the series, but the fact that it was the series finale and, by extension, somewhat of a ""farewell"" to the entire franchise, made it nothing short of horrifying. And I won't get into the end of the episode, but it was the visual equivalent of Rick Berman himself coming into your house and punching you in the nose and then saying ""THANKS FOR WATCHIN'!"" Those of you that have seen it know what I mean.My advice? Watch season one of enterprise, then skip over season two. Then watch seasons three and four up to ""Terra Prime."" That was a proper send-off to the series, not this piece of crap.",1
13,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" These Are the Voyages... (TV Episode 2005)",Ouch,"I refused to watch the 'so-called' final episode of Enterprise when it came out. I bought the series on DVD and in a last minute decision put on the B&B finale. I wish I could unsee it. I won't go into a repeated opinion of what many many other fans have said about how awful it was, let me just say that they are absolutely correct about what an insult this is to Enterprise fans and the cast.Something else that's never mentioned is that there are some people who are not TNG fans. With the exception of 2 episodes I hated the series and the crew for that matter except Picard, yet I understood its fan types and would have felt bad for them if the final episode of their series had been ruined in such a fashion as mine was. Having to watch Riker and Troi parade around as the main characters to the finale of another casts show was really an extra sting to many Enterprise fans and non-TNG fanboys. Sirtis and Frakes should have had the decency and common sense to realize what they were doing and opted to not do the episode. B&B are morons and I expect little from them and although this episode was horrible I can't honestly say I'm surprised they did it. Sirtis and Frakes, however, I'm disappointed with as I have enjoyed their works 'other' than TNG and they have now dropped into the 'feeder fish' category.",1
14,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" These Are the Voyages... (TV Episode 2005)",I regret watching the final episode,"It was such a nice series and this final episode just ruins it. So Trip has to die because they suddenly couldn't handle a bunch of second rate villains? How very unlikely. The captain and the crew are usually so cool, calm and collected and now this? That's what bothers me the most, but it's not the only thing. Suddenly we get to meet the chef who, apparently, was a sort of counselor all these years. He wasn't even mentioned once. Mixing all these Next Generation elements could have been fine in any other random episode, but not as the series finale. In the episode preceding the finale you see Trip all sad because the baby died, but also that he might be willing to have another one with T'Pol. That might have been a good ending. Next episode they suddenly haven't seen each other in years. Really weird.I'm sorry I ever watched it.",1

But I was hoping for a decent ending so I tuned in.But instead, they made it into a ""lost scene"" of the ST:TNG episode ""Pegasus"" and a crappy one at that. I like CDRs Riker and Troi, but hey, this was not their show! This episode revolved around them! Pathetic! I tried watching the show (ST:Enterprise) several times and even got into it a little when those Space Marines joined the crew. But every time I got into it, the show got bland again.The final episode was a chance to mend fences and make things right before warping into cancellation, to make the characters really shine before departing the airwaves.But no, oh no. They (writers and producers) appeared to do the ""desparate act"" and include past Trek characters to try to attract the old fans. They might have attracted the old fans, but the final product they got was substandard!",1

(TV Episode 2005)","Braga had promised ""Valentine to the fans"" – if you throw stones at girlfriend or wife on Valentines Day, he wasn't lying","It had been a rather rough and bumpy ride over the last four seasons, and by the final episode, there was the distinct certainty, that there would be no more. However, other than in the previous series, there was an air of relief. There had been too little character-development and way too few elements that would have kept the fan rooting for a continuation. Sure, the show had its moments, but those generally came from guest-appearances like Brent Spiner, Paul Weller and especially Jeffrey Combs; and that's no feat of glory when a shows appeal lies in waiting for satisfying guest-stars.But, knowing that the end was nigh, one did hope for a final firework; something to conjure up the magic that made shows like ""The Next Generation"" or ""DS9"" classics of (Science Fiction)-TV. After four seasons, it had become relatively clear that the scriptwriters were true hacks; hence I was ready to bet my head that there would be a guest-appearance from somebody from the prior series. But who would it be? Sure, it would have been far-fetched to expect Patrick Steward or Leonard Nimoy to appear and shake Captain Archers Hand (and as said: Spiner had already made his appearance), but perhaps Geordie LaForge? After all, LeVar Burton had directed a couple of episodes. Maybe Worf, Odo or Captain Sisko from ""DS9""? ""All too good for the likes of our audience"", the producer (presumably) mumbled to himself and cast the needy-looking host from ""X-Factor"" as special-guest. Hey, none of us is getting younger or handsomer (with the exception of Sophia Loren perhaps, but that's another story) and far be it from me to deny Jonathan Frakes a handful of dollars; mans got to eat and pay the rent. But the final episode of a ""Star Trek""-series should aspire to grandness, not inspire pity and next to Will Shatner himself, Frakes is the definition of washed-out has-been.Now, apart from the pointless, detracting ""guest-appearance"", what else did the screenwriters have in store for this celebration? The subplot of Shrans kidnapped daughter might have made a mediocre-to-alright episode, but for the final episode it simply raised the stink of lackluster, lazy screen writing which had plagued roughly 70 percent of the show.But perhaps I'm being too pessimistic; perhaps my expectation are too high and I should tell myself that it could have been much worst: they could have shown Picard and Riker playing a computer-game in the intro, blowing up the Enterprise, telling us that it was all a game in the holodeck all along, followed by a montage of Kirk fighting the Gorm, digitally stretched to 40 minutes.Ach, who am I kidding?

Touche! The fact is, the B&B send off reduced the cast of ""Enterprise"" to ghostly afterthoughts, not unlike hologram characters -- photonic images created by the bending of light, and not fully-formed, fleshed out characters. The cast that dedicated four years of their respective careers deserved much better than to be pushed to one side (WAY to one side!) to make way for the bulky Riker and Troi.A disgrace.

18,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" These Are the Voyages... (TV Episode 2005)",Barely Worth Watching,"Why bring Riker and Troi into this. The crew could have gone out in a blaze of glory with a script that was imaginative and exciting. We are pretty much told what happened and the characters act it out, stiffly and with little aplomb. This series was a bit inconsistent, at least in its first half, but the episodes became much more complex and creative in the second half. The final dual episode preceding this was one of the best of all. So we throw in this lame thing.

The death of Tripp left me feeling as violated as a drive-by shooting witness. Senseless and gratuitous, it still baffles me that this seemed like a good idea to anybody. The episode, arguably the worst of the four year run, probably contributes to the trepidation of Paramount in allowing a new TV series to this day. All of that being said, I don't HATE it. It is Star Trek, and it features people that I've enjoyed for years. Hopefully, any new adaptation in the Star Trek universe will put this episode into perspective as a teachable moment and the producers will remember rule number one.

Most of the cast are little more then extra's in this episode with next to no dialogueThe story of Trip and T'pol, which had been building up for 2 seasons is suddenly cast aside for no apparent reason, which also undermines the ending of the previous episode in which the death of Elizabeth drew them together. 2 seasons of buildup (including a now mind-link) which is just tossed aside with a casual line here.Shran is inserted out of nowhere, faked his death, has a child and quite a lot of other throwaway lines instead of actual plot on how this came to be.Trip's death was just plain insulting and completely unrealistic and so tacked on that made it seems like it never happened and Troi just added it in there for Riker's ""lesson"". The Pirates were stated to be in a slower ship, yet somehow caught up with no explanation. They somehow not only reached the ship virtually undetected and unopposed, but also got to the heart of the ship without any effort and held Archer at gunpoint again with no opposition. Where were the MAKO's, security or any other defense against a ship stated vastly inferior to Enterprise.Riker apparently did this simulation purely for the moment Trip defied orders and killed himself. The rest of the episode had nothing to do with this moment and the situation was in no way comparable to his own. Not to mention there are quite a few ""order defying"" moments in earlier episodes that served that purpose far better.Then we get Trip supposedly dying while under Phlox's care, which not only lacked any kind of emotion to it (Trip winking didn't help) but an actual death is NOT shown and T'pol is missing.Finally we have Troi ruining the episode multiple times. She says Trip will die 20 minutes before he does (why on earth was that line added) and she hypes up Archer's speech yet we never hear it. In the end this episode just came of as a non-canon Holodeck novel and not the actual events, mainly due to aspects happening that literally couldn't happen. The crew couldn't be identical 6 years later and Trip couldn't have died because those pirates couldn't reach the ship due to a huge difference in warp capabilities and they certainly couldn't enter the ship completely unopposed.",1

I'm giving Brannon Braga a -5, so it evens out to a ""5."" This guy was handed the reigns of ST:TNG and he drove in into the ground, ruining all of the progress made by better writers.It has been said that Brannon Braga blew up the Enterprise D, ""Because it didn't look very good in 16:9 aspect ratio""-Looks fine here though. Actually it looks Freakin' FANTASTIC, even for a Digital ""Model."" And that's the problem: ALL of the Next Generation scenes looked great, as good or better than TNG. But the problem is, this was NOT ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""Our two Next Gen crewmen, Troi and Riker, well for one thing they do NOT look like they did when ""The Pegasus"" was filmed, back in 1994? Marina could have pulled it off, if they had stayed away from all facial close-ups: In long shots, she actually looked pretty similar to her 1994 Doppelganger. But Riker, this is not the same Frakes that used to be called ""Ensign Babyface""- Had they done something like this around the time ""Insurrection"" was being made, he could have pulled it off, but in 2005, it was impossible.If this had been a stand alone Episode, earlier in the season, it would have been good and true Homage to ST:TNG, a nice salute. But here, at the end of Enterprise, it is a kick in Enterprise Crew's face.The framed ""Enterprise"" story was not really a good enough story to be the ""Last Mission"" and Tripp, having survived The Xindi and The Suliban, would not have let those Alien Gangbangers get the drop on him and Archer, so I don't believe that either. And I also did not believe there was a character called ""Cook"" that was a kind of 'Ship's Counsellor"" for 10 years? It's not that I didn't like the idea, and the way this was written, it was actually a Holodeck fantasy of Riker's, so he could interact with the crew of NX-01.What really bugs me is that Braga forgets canon, including the parts he wrote himself: When we watch ""The Pegasus,"" what was Will Riker doing right before? He WAS NOT on the Holodeck indulging himself: He was doing Calisthenics with WORF, and he Injured Himself. So I want to know, WHEN did this happen. Also, he never did tell Picard or Troi about the Pegasus or Admiral Pressman's agenda: He said nothing to anyone until he blew his stack after the Romulan Ship had disrupted them into the asteroid! But Ron D Moore wrote that episode, and this is an insult to him as well.So it was not only Enterprise ""canon"" that Braga ignored and wrecked, it was Next Generation canon as well.As far as the ""Enterprise"" Holodeck fantasy which was being played out, I guess it had ""something to do with the day the United Federation of Planets"" actually became a viable entity. Of course, which is what this episode should have been about. But THAT story was not told. Or rather, it was told, in several of the arcs from seasons 1 through 4. But it was not told HERE-It was not wrapped up here. The only reference to it was the final scene.So, thanks a lot, Braggo: For wrecking not only Enterprise, but also The Original Series, Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and even Voyager as well.EDIT: After Binge-Watching season 3, which I had never seen, I can safely assume, we can ignore this dud ""finale"": they could have saved Trip by making a new Sim and then fixing his life-span, like Sim suggested in ""Similitude"".

23,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" These Are the Voyages... (TV Episode 2005)",Assumes everybody has watched 'The Next Generation',"Sadly 'Enterprise' was doomed to be cancelled after a mere four seasons and although this episode was clearly designed to be the finale it feels more like a regular story that was slightly modified to make it the finale. Set several years after the previous episode the Enterprise is on its way back to Earth for the last time before being decommissioned. On the way they receive a call from Shren who was missing presumed dead; he wants Capt. Archers help as he has fallen in with some dubious characters and they have kidnapped his daughter and are demanding he return a huge jewel they believe he stole. As he did not steal it and they don't believe him he will have to take her back by force. The mission to rescue his daughter goes to plan but her erstwhile kidnappers are determined to get Shren and board Enterprise. Trip has an idea to neutralise them but in doing so he puts himself in grave danger. If this was the whole story it would be fine but it isn't told like a regular episode of 'Enterprise'; instead it is a holodeck program being played by Commander Riker aboard Picard's Enterprise. He is having a dilemma about breaking a promise regarding a treaty violation by the Federation and Councillor Troi has suggested he look at how things were done in the past.I liked the main story concerning Shren's daughter but couldn't see why it had to be told as a holodeck record watched by Will Riker. He even took the role of the ship's chef as we all know the crew of Archer's Enterprise liked to confide in the chef at least we would if he had been mentioned before! Having the last episode of 'Enterprise' linked to the crew of 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' like this just cheapened it and made it seem as if the characters we'd grown to care about over the last four seasons didn't matter. It's not that I don't like the characters of Riker and Troi; I just don't think they belong in this series after all it is quite likely that some people watching this will never have seen 'The Next Generation'. That wasn't the only problem, they also decided to kill off a main character, an odd choice for a final episode but even odder was telling us this person was going to die before it happened so there was no sense of shock when it did happen. Overall it was quite a disappointment; the series deserved a better send off.",5

Instead of a 'holodec reliving the last days' how about actually creating a gripping episode finale, rather than this 'lets establish the facts of the NX demise.' Each holedec interruption grew more and more tiresome. It just echoed the troubles the series was having behind the scenes. It's a real shame as I enjoyed the vast majority of the episodes / series thus far and to have it ruined by this was disappointing to say the least. Furthermore they really did make sure that this programme was killed off good and proper with this episode as now we know the end of the NX class story there would be no point creating more series now would there, not that it matters as it probably wouldn't have happened anyway these people have a great knack for destroying beloved programmes, anybody remember what happened to firefly.",1

Besides altering the physics of a cargo hold, the Expanse hasn't been nearly as threatening as it was cracked up to be. Archer has gotten a trip from the foreman of a mining operation that one of his workers is Xindi. This shady foreman (who does fantastic in his role by the way) allows Archer to talk to this Xindi for a price. But all of this turns out to be a trap as Archer and Trip are kidnapped. Battleships are on the way, intent on making the entire crew of the Enterprise slave laborers. Can Archer get the Enterprise and this Xindi out of there in time?It's nice to have a long-term plot for ST:E moving forward; this is a good start. The relationships between the Xindi-types have not been explained yet but I'm interested to see what exactly their entire race is about moving forward. The trope of Captain Archer getting kidnapped is old hat by this point but the inclusion of the military troops to the Enterprise makes their escape at least feasible. The Xindi conveniently gets killed during the escape and only leaves some cryptic coordinates behind for Archer to piece together. The Xindi-insect seems to have the itchiest trigger finger, ready to prematurely attack the Enterprise at any time. As the crew delves deeper into the void, only time will tell what lays in store.Sidenote: More pointlessly gratuitous skin shown on the part of T'Pol? Haven't we had enough of this already? She's a Vulcan Science Officer, not some pin-up model. Let's give her character a little respect huh? We don't do this with Hoshi or any of the male characters, so why with T'Pol?",7
2,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" The Xindi (TV Episode 2003)","Finally ... initiates a story arc worthy of the series' potential, but.....","In terms of plot and acting, The Xindi is one of the best episodes of the Entire Enterprise series. It does not suffer very much from the series' chronic plot recycling tendencies and offers a few scenes with intense evocation by Bakula, Trinnear, and even the usually understated Keating. The use of marines for a rescue op is also nice innovation and is carried out very well. Though on a whole the episode is better than average, it is not without the usual Enterprise problems (see last paragraph)A lot goes on in 'The Xindi' and several story arcs and subplots are set up for the third season of Enterprise. A mysterious council consisting of several different alien species - at least a few of which are Xindi - appear to be pulling the strings of the recent Xindi attack on earth, but the Enterprise's crew has learned next to nothing after 6 tense weeks in The Delphic Expanse. Finally, a Xindi slave-laborer is located on a mining planet and Archer offers him freedom for the coordinates of his home planet. Can't say much more without a spoiler, but I will say that the ending of The Xindi is, if nothing else, unconventional for the Star Trek franchise.On the negative side: * Enterprise's in-house writing team, and the director of this episode once again felt it necessary to ask Jolene Blalock to take her clothes off for another pointless, drama-less and gratuitous nude scene, and came up with an excuse worthy of a teenage boy under the influence of hormones as a plot device. * There is one major plot element which viewers have seen almost as many times as they've turned on their sets - Captain Archer gets involuntarily detained (sorry - having reviewed a few episodes of Enterprise, I have run out of synonyms for 'kidnapped'). * The Expanse, which has driven an entire crew of Vulcans to insanity and murder, and is built up as a cross between the place that the original crew of The Event Horizon went and Room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel in New York, after six weeks with the crew of the Enterprise, has only managed to throw some storage containers around in a cargo bay and put Archer in a bad mood? * Porthos does not appear. All considered - these minor quibbles should not prevent you from watching one of the series' better key episodes.",7

We are now looking toward an encounter with the Xindi, who are the new bad guys. They are a planet with five distinct species. On board the Enterprise we have a group of skilled marine type figures, sort of like special forces. They may present a problem at times because they are really arrogant but can back up their claims of superiority. As Trip and the Captain try to get information on the Xindi, they are taken captive (anything familiar) on another penal colony. They have a narrow escape, trusting someone who is a deceiver. Also, Trip gets some therapy. I have to say again, that if one is so cynical about a really positive episode because of some super knowledge of all the other fictional accounts in the canon, he should just stop watching it because there is no enjoying anything. I have seen every Star Trek episode and every movie prior to this and find this a good deal of fun.",10
4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" The Xindi (TV Episode 2003)",The series gets a makeover.,"Season three saw some MAJOR changes to try to reinvigorate the series--and it's all very obvious. The new baddies, the Xindi, are a huge departure in style to anything previously seen in any of the Trek shows. But more obvious are changes in the cast. T'Pol sports a hairdo that does NOT make her look like Moe Howard or Pete Rose and her makeup is more Vulcan AND more sexy. There are also space marines aboard the ship. But the biggest difference is that they've now sexed-up the series---with obvious and very gratuitous scenes where T'Pol is doing 'therapy' with Trip (i.e., they get very nekkid!). In general all these changes are for the good but the sexy naked scenes are a laughable attempt to garner viewers!This episode finds Archer and Reed in a very, very, VERY familiar situation--they've been kidnapped--though they don't realize it for a while. The pair have entered a mining colony to negotiate access to one of their Xindi workers--and then find out too late that it's a slave planet and the pair are new additions to the work force!This episode is a bit weak. The previous episode was super-exciting but this one featured a story idea which the show has done to death already (the whole kidnapping angle is overdone to death). However, on the positive side, the new alien enemy is revealed--and they are WONDERFUL. The Xindi are not one distinct race but six--and several of them are super creative (such as the aquatic and the insectoid Xindi). All in all a very mixed bag but very watchable.",7

Someone from the future told them that in 400 year their home world will be destroyed by humans. They decide to do what every civilized species would do.... NOT. They build a weapon for testing killing 7 million humans!! Then they continue to work on a weapon that will destroy earth completely.Why was there never a record in any of the series that earth was almost annihilated??? and this is only the beginning of errors. Stupid story lines are created to reveal Blaloks body in an attempt to raise ratings. It's a miracle that there was a 4th season.This episodes introduces the Xindi and sends them to the expanse where the most sophisticated spaceships are destroyed and bodies mutilated etc. However enterprise who is no where near as sophisticated as most manages to do OK in the expanse.

Captain Archer follows their track trying to recover their supplies and finds a mysterious sphere with reference about the Xindi culture. In order to get more information about the race, Archer tries to hack the computer of the Osaarian ship and download their database.The sequel of ""Expanse"" and ""The Xindis"" is another episode full of action. Now the Enterprise is feeling stronger effects of the Delphic Expanse that are affecting the engine and many systems.

In Anomaly, Archer and company are boarded by highly efficient pirates and stores, supplies, munitions and equipment are stolen. The crew takes one pirate prisoner and locks him up as they try to track the ship on which the others escaped. This pursuit eventually leads to the biggest, most mysterious anomaly they have yet encountered in The Expanse.This episode is fast-paced, economically directed and scripted, and original. The acting is also a cut above average for Enterprise.Recommended, but only after seeing The Expanse (season ender for Season 2) and The Xindi (season opener for Season 3).",8
2,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Anomaly (TV Episode 2003)",Yippee--the Captain gets tough!!,"While this episode is generally pretty average, one HUGE improvement occurs--you see Captain Archer angry...very, very, very angry. You also see him more than willing to potentially kill a prisoner-- something that wouldn't fit in with the normally super-sweet nature of the show. Considering that in the previous episode they did not just disable a Klingon ship but destroyed it, this all bodes well for season three.The ship is in some expanse of space that sucks. It has all sorts of weird anomalies and apparently folks traveling there behave pretty nasty. The crew learns that when they are attacked by space pirates and these jerk-faces steal many of the ship's supplies. At first, Archer tries being nice to the one raider they captured but when he realizes that they MUST be successful in their mission in order to save the Earth, he abandons their wienie-ways and he resorts to a bit of good old fashioned torture. Quite exciting and a marked departure from the norm.",9

Of course every space exploration from NASA has run into anomalies, so three years and encountering their first set of anomalies is pretty amazing...Enterprise becomes stranded by a particularly awful round of anomalies, however, and the disabled ship gets attacked by a pirate vessel that steals Enterprise's fuel.During the attack, one of the pirates is captured, Orgoth the Osarian. Orgoth is a particularly unpleasant capture. Having never met an earthling, he assumes that we don't torture, and he dares Archer to do so, otherwise he won't give him vital information. With this story line originating so soon after the 9/11 attacks, of course Archer obliges.This is - what? - the fifth pirate episode out of 50 produced? WAY TOO MANY. But this is the problem with this series, the writing wasn't that great. The problem with anomalies and maybe this being the first, or second pirate episode in season one would have made this a stand out episode. This late into it, it just serves as a plot advance technique.Further, the Producers sold the torture story as realism. Looking back upon it, it just seems lame. Having Orgorth play ""torture me, please"" isn't realistic, and it just seems that Star Trek was trying to give cover for the Bush Administration's torture policy. If they were reduced to this to try and save the show; pity. If they did this because they agreed with the Bush policy; worse. I didn't know they would use a show to comment on a present political policy situation.This torture bit mired the show to 2003-2004, and makes it laughable as time goes on.What a loss!",4

In many ways this was a fun episode. Action packed and fast paced with interesting visual effects. On the other hand we see some of the worst character writing since 'Night in Sickbay' with Archer being both a hothead and a prescription-strength asshat. The writers seem to have decided what American's want from TV in 2003 was more angry punishing of anyone who crossed our paths. In fact the entire season seems to be a weak-tea analogy for 9-11 and The-War-Against-Terror. Certainly Gene Roddenberry would have been appalled by the nihilistic vision this version of Star Trek embodies.",3

The Enterprise must regain their weapons and fuel or else risk the dangers of the Expanse without a lifejacket. Boy! Archer just gets more and more insufferable by the episode doesn't he? Him and Trip are going over the edge but Archer is becoming cold and jaded very quickly. His torture scene is the complete opposite of the typical Star Trek morality stance seen from a captain. I'm not saying its bad writing, its just disappointing to see Archer behave in this manner. It still makes for good television. War is ugly and the Enterprise is beginning to understand that. Whether this type of plot is right for Star Trek however, remains to be seen in my eyes. We'll see if Archer falls further down the rabbit hole. The pirate trope is a little played out by this point but I guess you have to eat up episodes somehow. The giant metal sphere was interesting. What's its purpose and origin? An unsettling device to say the least...Conclusion: It's nice to have a longlasting story arc, this episode furthers this if nothing else.",7

The story-line does, however, involve a few late-franchise clichés, such as the handy forehead-prosthetic new alien species (I don't even think they get a name in this one), and the script is pretty standard for the series.Overall, what makes this a successful and entertaining episode is Levar Burton's directing and some good physical acting from Bakula, Park and Blalock.",8

Meanwhile, the Enterprise is under siege of two alien ships with teams of exterminators that want to ""neutralize"" the infected crew to prevent an outbreak of the virus while Phlox researches the cure using the DNA of T'Pol.In ""Extinction"", there is a break in the non-stop action of the other three episodes and Archer, Reed, Sato are transformed in obsessive aliens by a mysterious laboratory virus that changes the DNA of other races to the one that is near extinction without capability of breeding, while the Vulcan T'Pol is only partially transformed.

Here in ""Extinction"", the same idea is recycled--which is a shame as the previous several episodes were marked improvements in the series.T'Pol, Hoshi, Archer and Reed land on some crappy planet. Just about immediately, they start changing into primordial creatures. With T'Pol the changes aren't as obvious. But with the other three they look and act and look a lot like characters from ""The Flintstones""--all animal-like and creepy. This calls for the cast to act (or, shall I say over-act) like odd sorts of thingies. As for me, I grew tired of all this nonsense very quickly and I had to fight the urge to just go on to the next episode.Soon after they are infected, some aliens arrive and announce that the planet is quarantined and Enterprise won't be allowed to take the infected crew members out of orbit. It DOES make sense, as apparently the virus on the planet turns folks into members of a long deceased and goofy species that inhabited the place and built cities.So is it any good? Well, apart from being a retread of sorts AND featuring some goofy acting, the story idea isn't terrible. Hardly a glowing endorsement, I know.By the way, SOME of the graphics for the city (particularly the one the infected folks picture in their mind) are really poor. I know it was filmed a while back when CGI was much less refined, but this was ridiculously bad even for then.",4

Doctor Phlox must find a cure quickly before another alien race decides to exterminate the humans to neutralize the disease.While a fun concept (although not entirely new), it isn't executed as well as it could have been. Some of the acting in this one is a bit cheesy and the CGI does not hold up at all to the modern eye. It also always baffles me that Archer decides to head to these unknown planets and head down immediately without any kind of scouting team or using hazmat suits or anything like that. He just goes down and explores and it has led him into trouble multiple times.Anyhow, this episode's fairly bland. It's not terrible but it does nothing to further the overall plot (besides the Enterprise learning of a new Xindi species).",6

These are TV actors and they don't have time to hone their parts and do numerous retakes like in movies. Also, would you like them to spend a few hundred thousand dollars to do a series of miniatures that appear on screen for a minute or two. That said, the story did distract us for a time from the principal direction. The entire season seems devoted to the Xindi story line, so there has to be a bit of other exploration along the way. Here, a virus that has nearly obliterated a race is being controlled by extermination of those with the syndrome, including those who are part of the extermination team. The away team gets infected and the powers that be tell the Enterprise that they will take care of things. Phlox steps in and seems to be able to do things beyond those of the scientists that have been dealing with this for a long time.

The crew continues to work on a way to adapt the ship to the anomalies of the expanse, and Archer's nerves are on the ragged edge. While away on a shopping trip, Archer encounters a female slave who seems hell-bent on accompanying him back to Enterprise. She escapes her bonds, runs to Archer for protection, and the away team defends her.Once Rajin is on board, it seems as if the episode is going to be yet another Enterprise exploitation of an attractive female, but the plot eventually takes surprisingly interesting turn which I won't spoil here.Recommended, but only if you've seen the earlier parts of Season 3. This is the season that sealed Enterprise's fate. The franchise decided to begin a complex DS9-length story-arc at the end of Season 2, which would span most of season 3. While not unprecedented among ST shows, this was certainly unprecedented in Enterprise. Trekkies became disturbed by the distant departure from the canon which was required by the Delphic Expanse and the Xindi episodes, and the show's dwindling audience, many of whom began their ST interests with Enterprise, didn't know what to make of it.

Her eyes and her appearance affected Archer and the others. They used some bad judgment for sure, but it was a natural thing for a compassionate man to try to rescue her.

I cannot help but to admit that the episode was quite impressive, almost intimidating. However, at first sight I felt like I was watching a live-action version of Resident Evil 4 lol. Does anybody share this sentiment?
The Vulcan zombies are mad but seem still not QUITE there. I mean, they still have at least some of their consciousness and intelligence. This feature cannot be more in line with RE's Majinis and Ganados. And their appearance, that scrambled-yet-still-recognizable look also resembles a typical RE enemy unit of the 2000s.
I always enjoyed the scenes where T'Pol's logical side and emotional side come to clash. T'Pol has already gained a lot of role development in that respect, but this is the very first time where she completely loses that facade and reveals the ""paranoia, homicidal rage"" facet of pre-Sarek Vulcans. This is not easily played, because shows involving strong emotions often make the worst awkward scenes, but Jolene Blalock played it well. The mental deterioration of T'Pol are seen to have clear steps, and when she blasts off, her craze looked genuine. The whole bridge crew(excluding poor Linda Park who hardly even get a technobabble line this time) performed quite well. In addition, Captain Archer shows his fully human side for the first time since the break of the Xindi crisis.
However this episode has notable potholes. The medical and technological capacities of Seleya should be beyond the level of a single, obscure distress call when disaster impends. The fact that all Vulcan zombies uses primitive arms instead of guns(actually nothing but bent pipes) is visually impressive but unconvincing. Most importantly, while the ship apparently still retains most of its basic functions, it blew up without reason right after our hero crew escapes, it seems too good a coincidence: ""too good to be real"".

Some tense moments ensue as the Xindi miner attempts to convince Archer that he had no idea what Degra and his Xindi military customers intended for the material he was shipping out.The acting in this episode was sub-par, and greatly hindered by the ridiculous hairiness and make-up used for this species of Xindi. Why any creature endowed with so much hair would choose to stuff all of it into tight fitting clothing obviously designed for more or less hairless apes is very difficult to fathom.

This episode was fairly unspectacular. There was never really anything exciting happening, although we do get valuable knowledge into the Xindi history and culture.

2,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Twilight (TV Episode 2003)",One Of Enterprise's Best,"After two seasons effectively wandering in the wilderness, the third season of the Star Trek prequel series Enterprise finally saw the show starting to find its feet. Centered around the threat of a Xindi super weapon that could destroy the Earth and the hunt for it in uncharted space, the third season was a different beast from what had come before. Perhaps as an example of that, the season's eighth episode Twilight presented an intriguing tale of a possible future that not only raised the stakes of the crew's hunt but also explored two of the show's characters as well.Mike Sussman's script for Twilight is an intriguing piece of work, following in the tradition of a number of alternate time-line episodes across the various Star Trek series. In forty-three minutes it does a lot from jumping through time to showing the potential fate of Earth if Enterprise fails on its mission. Indeed the episode does more than episode before it to establish the threat of the Xindi which, even though we saw their attack in the second season finale along with its aftermath, had always seemed vague up until now. From its teaser sequence to the climax, Twilight keenly proves that the Xindi are a threat to humanity which adds to the proverbial clock of doom hanging over the crew in episodes after this. Add in references to the Original Series in the form of Ceti Alpha V and what Trek fans will likely remember of that planet's fate and the result isn't pretty for humanity one way or the other. While the episode does employ something of a reset button, the episode's pluses overcome it thanks to solid writing on the part of Sussman.The episode also does some interesting explorations of the Archer and T'Pol characters as well. Sussman's script deftly takes us on a journey through the characters time between the events of the present day and this possible future and it allows for some fine performances as well. Scott Bakula, who described this episode at the time as ""potentially the best script we've had and the best show to date"" is particularly notable for being Archer as a time always out of time who at times struggles to comprehend the enormity of the events he's missed. Jolene Blalock's T'Pol is just as well served by Sussman's script which explores the relationship between the two and T'Pol's struggle as Enterprise's captain in his absence before becoming his caretaker hinting at the bond between them. The episode's framing device is essentially a two-hander between the two which does not do it a disservice as it offers both Bakula and Blalock a chance to shine.As a production, the episode also ranks as one of Enterprise's best efforts. Robert Duncan McNeill (who play Tom Paris on Voyager) does a strong job as director with a script that could have been difficult given the amount of time it covers as well as action sequences and more dramatic scenes. The production design of the episode also does a fine job on conveying the passage of time with wear and tear to the ship as well as Archer's dwelling on Ceti Alpha V. The episode is also one of the series special effects triumphs taking in the destruction of Earth, battle sequences and even the destruction of the Enterprise herself. The icing on the cake may well be Dennis McCarthy's score which gives the episode a music score worthy of one of Trek's big screen adventures. Twilight then, despite its ending, stands as one of the best episodes to come out of Enterprise. From Mike Sussman's script that finally establishes a firm threat from the Xindi while exploring the characters of Archer and T'Pol to its production values, it stands out from the pack of Enterprise's first couple of years. It's also a turning point for Enterprise as a whole and was the first sign of what the series might be capable of. On its own it stands out as one of Star Trek best alternate time-line episodes and rightfully so.",9
3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Twilight (TV Episode 2003)","Cohesively self-contained, understated and quite poetically beautiful...","While - as other reviewers note - we have seen this kind of thing before; we have not seen writers and makers join forces with Jolene Blalock to go the extra mile in dreaming up a story with some kind of Greek mythology undertones. A tender and ultra-kissable T'Pol here has the utterly thankless task of re-briefing a now-civilian Jonathan Archer with the same information basic and less basic with each new day for year after year, given his memory loss incurred at a moment when he sacrificed himself for her sake. While the makers of ""Enterprise"" quite often flirted with the chemistry between Archer and T'Pol in a sexual(-ish) way, here all is tenderness and mercy and devotion, and it's truly beautiful to behold. Since this is a passage-of-time episode, the emotions are piled on further in all directions, and since hugely dramatic consequences ensue for Enterprise's main mission, the story telling is surreal, enigmatic, warm and meaningful. Cleverly then, the return-to-the-meant-to-be-timeline that does prove possible leaves us actually slightly regretting that this beautiful thing we've seen no longer exists in the re-established reality. An enigmatic effect, and a tribute to the power of fine, understated performances from Bakula and Blalock, and also from John Billingsley as Phlox - yet another character here (along with Reed and Tucker), who is prepared to devote DECADES of life and unstinting work against the odds in the name of loyalty and friendship.

4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Twilight (TV Episode 2003)",Archer as Billy Pilgrim,"Twilight is an important episode in the evolution of Captain Archer and T'Pol's characters. However, it is unclear, throughout most of the episode whether any part of what we are seeing is actually happening. This ambiguity is a big part of the plot, but it almost feels as if the writers wanted to experiment around with a few new ideas but wanted the option to take them back if they interfered with the series' arcs or overall development.Most of the episode involves what MIGHT be an alternative future where extra-dimensional bacteria associated with the anomalies in the expanse have infected Archer's brain and he has either become extremely delusional or he has lost his anchor in his own time as well as his ability to create new memories.Although cleverly plotted, there are quite a few logical inconsistencies in the story - but these depend upon which of the alternative explanations hold. And, to avoid a spoiler, I can say no more.Acting - terrific. Cinematography and Directing (by Tom Paris!) - good. Script - better than average for Enterprise. Worth a careful viewing.",8

When nobody from the bridge answers his hails he leaves his quarters only to be stopped by a security guard. When confronted the guard tells him that ""the captain"" has ordered him confined to quarters. Archer manages to knock out the guard and makes his way to the bridge where he sees Enterprise in Earth orbit engaged in battle with the Xindi. The Xindi knock Enterprise out of the fray and deploy a super-weapon which destroys the Earth. Cut to commercial ...When we return, a story of the past unfolds where it is revealed that Archer has been infected by transdimensional parasites which keep him from forming long-term memories. We eventually discover that Archer was infected after risking his live to save T'Pol during an Enterprise encounter with an anomaly. Phlox, over time, tries everything but cannot cure Archer of these parasites which have lodged in his brain. As the story progresses, it is revealed that, due to the failure of Enterprise's mission to locate the Xindi weapon (during the last mission Archer remembers), that the Xindi have destroyed not only Earth, but every colony settled by humans. In a scene reminiscent of ""Battlestar Galactica,"" the ragtag survivors of humanity settle on a planet off the beaten path, where Archer finds himself with T'Pol, who resigned her commission to take care of the human who saved her now some twelve years ago, patiently retelling the story to Archer on a near daily basis as he cannot remember any of the intervening time. However, this day is different, as Phlox has finally discovered a way to remove these parasites from Archer's brain. Unfortunately, the procedure can only be performed where a warp coil is present, so they adjourn to Enterprise to perform a test procedure before eradicating them totally.The test is a success - or so it seems, until further investigation reveals that the few parasites removed during the test were *also* removed from all the historical scans. T'Pol and Phlox posit that removing the rest of the parasites might also change time, which would give Archer the chance to continue the original mission and locate the Xindi weapon before it could be used to destroy humanity. Unfortunately, a spy is discovered who has informed the Xindi of Phlox' whereabouts, and six Xindi ships appear on the scanners and prevent the procedure from being completed.Enterprise and Intrepid (with newly enhanced shields) move off to engage the Xindi fleet, and while they have some success, first Intrepid and then Enterprise are crippled. T'Pol and Phlox realize there may be no other chance and take Archer to Engineering where the earlier test had been performed. Unfortunately the medical unit has been crippled during the battle; Archer realizes that a controlled detonation of the engines would produce the same radiation as Phlox' procedure and tells T'Pol and Phlox to evacuate. They refuse and go about the process of setting the engines to overload. The Xindi have by now breached the Enterprise defensive, and make their way to Engineering where they kill first Phlox and T'Pol, whose efforts buy Archer just enough time to take the final actions despite being shot. With his final breath, Archer pulls the final trigger and collapses on top of T'Pol. The resulting explosion engulfs and totally destroys Enterprise as we fade to black...Archer wakes in sick bay, twelve years earlier, where Phlox tells him he has suffered a mild concussion. T'Pau tells Archer Enterprise has left the anomaly behind.",10

""Twilight"" has a similar sort of set-up...but fortunately the secrets to why this has occurred are very different and make both worth your time.So, in this case, it's Archer who awakens and finds many years have passed--12 to be exact. The last 12 years have been absolutely horrible. The Earth and its major colonies off world have all been destroyed by the Xindi's new doomsday machine. What's left of the humans, just a few thousand folks, are now living on a small, far away planet.As for Archer, he was injured long ago while trying to save T'Pol's life. This injury, oddly, has destroyed his ability to remember what has just occurred--and his long-term memory is still intact. So everything he experiences AFTER the injury he soon forgets--much like Drew Barrymore in the film ""Fifty First Dates"". Is there any way Archer can somehow undo this damage and, perhaps, undo the last 12 years?This is a very intriguing 'what if' episode.

The relationship established between Archer and T'pol is great and befitting the sacrifices made. This series of Star Trek was a tribute to excellent science fiction. Why don't they bring the TV series back? It is a mystery why the series was cancelled, the films are nowhere near the series. The characterisation and interplay is unique and I wonder why this type of relationship was not developed in more detail during later episodes. I also enjoyed the touch of the 5th planet of Alpha Ceti, coming back to Khans planet before the episode space seed in the original series. this is clever and we see the planet as it was long before Khan is marooned there. The interplay between the two in this episode is relived in the final episode of the series just before Archer addresses the federation Council. this relationship is much stronger than the one developed between T'pol and Trip . It is also far more believable.

If they do not complete their mission Earth will be destroyed, only 6,000 humans will remain in the galaxy, and the future of the entire quadrant are in serious question.The episode begins with probably the single greatest teaser ever in Star Trek with its only competition coming from TNG's ""Cause and Effect"". The viewer is treated to the fulfillment of the Xindi plan and the destruction of Earth on a scale not even seen in big budget action movies of the present day. From there the episode kicks in, but with a truly interesting and telling story of T'Pol's sacrifice and caring for the man that saved her life instead of explosions and high powered action. This is really T'Pol's greatest performance in the entire series and she excels in every part of it. Whether it is her caring for Archer, her hidden love for the man, or just the desire to help her Captain for saving her life she gives an amazing performance which is highlighted several times in her conversations with Phlox, Trip, and Soval. This episode may center a round Archer and the parasites, but the rest of the crew really shine in this one and getting to see all the crew(except Mayweather?) years later and who they have become is really a treat with this one. The episode ends with an amazing battle against the Xindi where we get to see the bridge destroyed and the reset button pushed, but that does little to harm this charming story about T'Pol's character.

Seeing this alternate timeline where Archer is no longer involved with the battle of the Xindi was fascinating to watch. I loved the progression of the Archer-T'Pol relationship as she feels a sense of gratitude and obligation for the price that Archer took for her. It's very ambiguous what has occurred between the two living in that hut all these years.The initial scene of Earth blowing up was very touching, even more so when you know the back story.

The reveal allows the episode to end with thought-provoking historical catch-up that is sure to bring a tear to the eye of anyone who ""feels"" what Trek is all about.""Enterprise"" was always the most workmanlike of the Trek spinoffs, but here we have another Season 3 episode that makes it clear how much can be achieved with a clear-purpose, powerful, ostensibly non-complex story put across by actors that now feel entirely comfortable in their roles.

Like many other episodes, it does wrap up somewhat quickly, but I thought it was a decent ending. It's worth watching if you enjoy westerns, but if you only care about the Xindi story arc you can skip this one without missing anything.

But after a slave uprising freed the humans from their captors, the humans took the upper hand and have controlled the planet ever since. Archer, T'Pol, and Trip attempt to research these colonist firsthand and see if they can reform them and their ideas. Okay... I have a few questions. 1) If the Skagarans were technologically advanced enough to get a warp-capable ship all the way from their planet in the Expanse to Earth and have high-tech weapons, how in the world did they get overthrown by a bunch of cowboys? 2) After the humans took control, why did they not use a single item of technology, instead sticking to their old customs? You think they would have used the ""guns with beams of light"" they described to control the Skagarans or researched how they worked and advanced their own technology in some capacity. These seem like important questions that this episode never addresses. I love a good Western as much as the next guy, but these plot holes staring me in the face in this episode distracted me from the overall plot.

So yeah everything looks and sounds wrong in that episode, possibly the worse of the whole enterprise series, especially since Season 3 was getting so good and intense, this just brings back the sad ghosts of voyagers worse episodes.. to be forgiven fast, and can totally be skipped even since you won't miss it for the upcoming episodesmy note: 3/10",3

I understand it's a work of fiction, but I think for the safety of the actors (including the animal ones) and accuracy they should have considered basing some things off of something more than a complete work of fiction. Overall I liked the episode, but was somewhat let down by the end of the show. After the first mistake, I couldn't sit back and really enjoy it.

A few curve balls were thrown in but the ending was pretty predictable.

There was one scene I thought was done especially well. I actually cried when I saw it the first time, and almost cried when I saw a rerun of it again less than a year later. It is an obvious allusion to stem cell research and makes for great drama. This could even be adapted into a movie - maybe not a Star Trek movie but a space drama or a sci-fi movie with the plot centering around a human rights debate. Who know? Maybe no one else liked it.

Archer authorizes the procedure but he has troubles with the fast-growing clone that has Trip memories and his own personality together. Meanwhile the Enterprise is trapped without propulsion in a dangerous particles field.""Similitude"" is a good episode where the ethical issue of using clone to replace parts is exposed. I immediately recalled ""The Island"", proving that the cloning process shall be discussed by the society and controlled through well-studied laws. Unfortunately the plot is disclosed in the very beginning, but the ambiguous feeling of Sim (or Trip?) for T'Pol is rewarded with her farewell kiss.

6,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Similitude (TV Episode 2003)",Strong episode with some holes,"Manny Coto certainly wrote a thought-provoking episode in 'Similtude', but there were a couple of holes, or at least potential problems, that I identified.Trip, after an accident with the engine, enters a coma, and the only way to save him is to essentially grow a clone of Trip using one of Phlox's biological specimens. This clone will only live for about 15 days, so his growth will be accelerated.Archer agrees to this procedure being conducted, as, according to him, Trip is important to Enterprise and Enterprise is important to Earth. Some may question why any crew member - even the Chief Engineer - is this important to Enterprise: surely Enterprise would still function without him/her? Yes, Enterprise probably could continue to function, but the probability that it will function to a better degree is high, and therefore the probability that Enterprise will be able to save Earth is higher, even if not by that much.A twist comes in when Phlox reveals that the operation will actually kill Trip's clone and that there is a potential enzyme that would allow Trip's clone to live out a full life, but there's very little evidence that this would work. To some viewers, this may complicate the moral dilemma: after all, Trip's clone is able to help Enterprise just as much as Trip himself, as demonstrated by the fact that he got them out of a cloud of particles that was engulfing the ship. Once again, however, probabilities are the key: the probability that taking the part of the brain from the clone required to save Trip will actually achieve the goal of saving Trip is higher than the probability that the aforementioned enzyme will save Trip's clone. So, once again, Archer makes the right decision.My problem with Archer in this episode, though, is his mood swings: one minute, he's telling Sim (Trip's clone) how he has rights and how valuable he is; in another scene, he's angry with Sim for even considering that he's Trip or as important as Trip (even though he has exactly the same memories.) Overall, though, a good episode doing what Star Trek often does best - explore ethical dilemmas, especially those similar to those we face in society today.",8

8,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Similitude (TV Episode 2003)",The Best Episode of Enterprise,"Do the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few? It is a question answered by Spock in ""The Wrath Of Kahn"" and it is a question asked by the best episode of Enterprise, ""Similtude"". This episode, which stands as the best one in the wonderful third season of Enterprise, gives us a well-crafted tale that discusses how far would you go to save billions of people using the controversial issue of stem cell research and cloning. This one is a double-header that tackles two big heavy handed issues and handles them both with skill and emotion.
Morality issues are a Star Trek staple, but rarely do we get to see two separate issues handled as powerfully as we do here in ""Similtude"". On one side we have Archer and Sim dealing with the larger implications of the Xindi conflict and the price of a life when it could possibly save everyone on Earth. On the other side we are presented with Sim's story of a clone who is only created to be harvested for ""spare parts"". Both of these stories are intertwined together quite nicely and the story relies on both of them completely. If one of them did not exist or if it were handled differently the entire story would have come crashing down. Reminiscent of Voyager's ""Tuvix"", ""Similtude"" also deals with the complicated issues involved in trying to put a value on one person's life over another. On the surface Archer's decision to kill Sim in order to save Trip's life seems like a cold-hearted and brutal thing to do and his reasoning to save him because he needs Trip on this mission seems like a front. Sim is capable of doing the same job just as well as Trip. Archer more than likely makes his decision based on the fact that Trip is his friend and he has to make the choice that is more likely to end in success. There is a very small possibility that Sim's aging could stop and he can live out the remainder of his life normally, but Trip's life is nearly guaranteed to be saved by the death of Sim. The hard choice Archer makes is based partially on friendship, but when you look at stakes involved in their mission he really had no other choice. If you consider all the factors and elements of this tale and the powerful way in which it was executed, Enterprise's ""Similtude"" could stand its ground against the best of anything Star Trek has ever done.",9
9,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Similitude (TV Episode 2003)",Makes you think.,"This is definitely one of the standout episodes of the series. Note this review will contain spoilers. There are a few reviews already commenting on the high quality of the episode, but I wanted to discuss the ethical/character issues with the episode.In this episode I feel we saw a darker side of Archer. In particular, the scene where he said he would indeed commit murder to save his crew member. I was a little surprised by his stance here. I feel that this probably contradicts his character somewhere else in the series, but I cannot think of an example right now so perhaps not. Ultimately he saw Sim as less than human, which seems unethical. Though he is clearly torn, as he initially was against the idea.What throws a wrench in the morality of sacrificing Sim is that there was the possibility of extending his life, which both the doctor and the captain dismissed. The fact that he originally would not have lived long anyways almost justifies his sacrifice, or does it? But the fact that his life could be extended changes things. Should they have willingly brought the death of a creature to save another? Or should they have saved the life of a creature and tried to extend his life and accepted that they would to try another way to save the crew member? I feel that the latter choice would be the more moral one. They had ruled out all other possibilities of saving Trip. There may have been another they had not thought of. On a side note, I thought that the whole idea of having a symbiote that could so easily grow a genetic copy of a being was an inconsistency in the Star Trek world. Why wouldn't they have used this in any other series of Star Trek? It could have been incredibly useful in countless other episodes. The doctor reasoned it away as it was a closely guarded secret, but come on. How could it have been such a secret, especially if it was so attainable as Flox kept a spare just hanging around in his lab? Not to mention, this series took place long before the other series. I would think this symbiote would have become more well known over time, especially considering the incredible usefulness of it. Why wouldn't for example the doctor of Voyager, a literal database of all medical knowledge, have knowledge of this symbiote? Anyway, I suppose it is only a TV show, but this point did stand out to me. Overall, I concur with the viewers that this was one of the better episodes. I feel that one of the strengths of Star Trek has been the way it makes you consider moral and social dilemmas. These types of episodes are my favorite. And I haven't seen a whole lot in Enterprise. So I am pleased to have been able to enjoy this episode. It improved my opinion of Enterprise in general.",10
10,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Similitude (TV Episode 2003)",Wow... this is just great,"Continuing with the run of fine (non-Xindi) episodes in the middle of Enterprise's Season 3, ""Similtude"" from LeVar Burton offers an object lesson in how to temper crowdpleasing wish fulfilment up to the point of near-manipulation (as when not-Tucker finally gets a kiss from T'Pol) with what is otherwise mostly an understated, subtle plotline. In short, there is something for pretty much everyone here, with a ""Never Let Me Go""-type moral dilemma explored far more warmly, if of course SOMEWHAT more shallowly, than in Ishiguro's novel. Nevertheless, there's no escaping what happens here, and Archer's tough decisionmaking (part of a trend for the season) hits home. Connor Trinneer rightly takes centre-stage, but yet again Billingsley moves us with his exquisite rendering of Phlox, with both fully aware how thin the moral ice they are skating on really is. Meanwhile, Blalock matches her peak achievements thus far when T'Pol perfectly fuses some kind of faintly motherly kindness/pity/sympathy with genuine romantic need. In the circumstance, the character just could not behave otherwise and be ""human"" (as it were!), and of course this is what she does, in a real sense poignantly, since this powerfully romantic and touching moment does not even involve the real Trip. Plenty of credit also to the (then) boy actor Adam Taylor Gordon who portrays the as-it-were ""8-year-old"" Sim.Hopefully, the touch of spoiling here will only serve to encourage sceptics about ""Enterprise"" to give this episode a go (along with the previous 3 or 4 in fact, at minimum).

Back to back really good ST:E episodes, I don't think that's ever happened before. The ethical dilemmas in this episode are interesting to think about and the performance by Connor Trinneer is top notch. The last half of this episode really is quite touching. It also further hints at the budding relationship between Trip & T'Pol.For those arguing that there is no tension in this episode because we know a main cast member like Trip won't die in a random mid-season episode, you're missing the point. This episode is meant to ponder the ethical dilemmas of life and death, not give us shock value at a character's passing. There's still plenty of emotion in it as we watch Sim, a character we feel we know and identify with, sacrifice himself for the crew and the ship.This is a great standalone episode to show someone of this series. It's interesting, well-directed by LeVar Burton, and one of the best episodes up to this point.Side Note: I'm sorry; I don't like Captain Archer.

While I really enjoyed it, I felt like enterprise really compromised their morals on this one. I hope in our future we don't start growing sentient clones just to harvest their organs, because it's just wrong. If you can grow a specific organ in a test tube, great, but murdering somebody for their organs ? Disgusting.

Captain Archer influences Sim (a life form that lives just about two weeks) to give his short life to save Trip, ergo to save the ship and the Earth and so forth. I cannot agree with this reasoning because he is asking a man to give his life for other life on the logic that Trip life is more important to the ship. How can that reasoning make the crew more human? All the opposite, the star trek thing to do would be for the crew to try the impossible in order to save even that one life.At the end the only one who really learns to be a better human being is Sim, the symbiotic that decides to sacrifice himself, in order to prevent future calamities like Trip's sister death.",1
15,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Similitude (TV Episode 2003)",Where is the loophole?!

You can understand why but it's still very disturbing stuff.Near the beginning of the episode, Trip is severely injured and near death. Dr. Phlox has a possible (but highly morally questionable) answer. He's learned about something called 'mimetic symbiots'-- identical clones who are born, live and die all in a space of only 15 days. The plan is to make one of these copies of Trip and harvest the parts needed from the clone. However, they do NOT plan on murdering the clone and what they take won't apparently kill the copy.Soon you see a baby Trip. And, it grows and grows very quickly. However what it grows into seemed really dumb. This clone inexplicably had Trip's memories and even talked with the same accent--even though he wasn't raised in the Southern US like Trip. Unfortunately, a serious problem develops...one that makes the about the clone having memories and an accent--which makes no sense upcoming surgery FAR more morally suspect. Overall, it's an interesting episode but has three huge problem. I mentioned above from a clone. The entire show IS anticlimactic because Trip is a series regular and fans KNOW that there is no way they'll let him die. So the crew will no doubt pull some answer out of their posteriors by the end of the show. Finally, if the clone only lives 15 days, wouldn't the organs harvested from it also have a very short life as well? Just wondering...",5

Sure there is still one dead in the end but things could have gotten a bit more realistic, and more in line with the characters, Archer would have NEVER forced someone to die, especially a friendly human, in order to save someone else, be it his chief engineer (especially since the clone would be just as competent for the mission) So it could really have been a turn in the series and captain Archer profile, and why not? after all they're dealing with a morale breaking dilemma, I think it calls to a different approach than the usual friendly explorer routine hereSadly the writers stepped back in the end to make some kind of status quo, basically everything at the end of the episode is the same as the beginning, nothing changed, this episode could as well have never happened! So it's still a very interesting episode, with good acting, great topic, just lost 2 points (at least) for the unoriginal ending, lack of ambition, fear of the unknown (ironic for a series such as star trek isn't it?) in the light of changes for the characters and the universe.. it's a shame: 8/10 nonetheless",8

We don't see enough of Leland Orser like others of his ilk, because they're too good; they act as though they aren't acting and so most of the audience are so convinced that they don't realise what an incredible job they're doing - especially with the kind of characters that Leland Orser plays. So if you want to see a master at work, then watch this episode.Apart from that the story works really well and is shot in a grittier hand-held style that suits the dark atmosphere and it's a big departure from the tight gloss of the usual Enterprise episodes - it's all about the characters; no CGI or tech-speak. Perhaps you could compare it to an episode of the X Files; it looks kind of similar and the plot would work in that series.In total it's very enjoyable from the first scene to the last; it keeps moving, every sequence adds to the storyline and it keeps you glued to the screen right the way through. Over all it's a triumph and an episode you could watch as a stand-alone and get what's going on in this series. It was also good to see Archer and T'Pol out of their normal context; though I'm glad it doesn't happen too often - this episode goes along with the long tradition of Trek crews finding themselves on Earth in the past, or in pseudo Earth societies on other worlds.",9

The rest fares very poorly.Just when Season 3 was picking up to start to change the mold of mediocrity that seasons 1-2 had dug Enterprise in to, it goes straight back into that mediocrity with yet another one-off story which at least has the decency to involve the main Xindi storyline arc in it, as opposed to the last few episodes.",1

The crew of the alien ship seem polite enough, but eventually it becomes clear that Enterprise's research on the spheres of The Expanse is going to be exploited as a religion-based excuse to expropriate the ship and use it to commit genocide. If any of this sounds familiar (from previous ST stories or real world history), then you are catching on.The episode is also probability-challenged.

OK, suicide biobombing is a nice twist, but you think by this time Enterprise would have had something installed to protect it from hijacking.

I realize other writers have said the same thing. The part that I was fine with was a commentary on religious zealots.

That's right, these people are literally involved in a gory civil war over how many days the Gods built their spheres.This doesn't even begin to resemble a parody or a referencing of actual historical differences and fractures in the Christian Church or Muslim faith. The differences there were many, and varied, and never lead to war over theological differences, unless they were also supported by ulterior motives; hint: the Thirty Years War was less about Catholic-Protestant theological differences than about politics, regal rivalries, and power.That's not even remotely hinted upon in this farce of an episode.And in a move that not only beats you over the head, but comes literally out of nowhere, and with no real explanation as to how Archer found their homeworld, the homeworld of these fanatics is in ruins, as both sides have extinguished themselves.This was done before, and better, and more believably in The Original Series episode ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield""",1

There's one scene in particular where D'Jamat is comparing himself to Archer and talking about how their missions weren't so different that really made an impact on me. Watching Archer have to take a look in the mirror and consider whether D'Jamat is right was strangely effective, almost powerful. The implausibility comes in when you consider how easily Archer gave up command of the ship. You think he might have fought back a bit more and could have avoided thus entire episode.

That part of it made it somewhat unrealistic.This episode could be considered offensive because it is only showing the very negative aspects of certain religious stereotypes. It could have been written by any one of the ""... religious people want to destroy the universe!"" people. I noticed that it was not written by Christopher Hitchens. Maybe he should have been credited as an influence!To round everything off, the end was very much an anticlimax. Going by the profile of the extremist leader, the destruction of the planet that is shown to him at the end would not have had any real impact on him. The question is then: why is he shown as being in awe of the destruction? Is this not the very type of destruction he would want for his ""enemies""?

Archer also demonstrates that intelligence wins over religious fanaticism. The message may have been too extreme for some to grasp its full implications, however. Religious bigotry and hate don't just exist between the fanatic groups on our world.

Can an exchange and help from the Andorians really help them in their mission?This is an excellent episode--not just because I love Shran as a character. There are lots of great twists and unexpected surprises. However, I won't elaborate, as it would spoil things.

Along the way, they encounter many obstacles, not least of which is the very nature of the region they must traverse -- fraught with ""spatial anomalies"" that twist space into an impassable region that everyday threatens to destroy Enterprise and thwart their mission. In ""Proving Ground"", they receive much needed help from the Andorrians and, in particular, series regular guest, Commander Shran of the Andorrian Imperial Guard.Without revealing too much, Shran assists the crew of Enterprise navigating this tricky part of space and to capture a prototype of the weapon which is being built to destroy Earth. The episode is filled with misdirection and some of the most amusing writing of an otherwise grim 3rd Season (""Helm, move off...but slowly...the Andorrian Mining Consortium runs from no one!"").Highly recommended, this episode represents some of the best writing, acting and directing of the entire series run. It is not a ""stand-alone"" episode, and is best enjoyed in the context of the entire season. Another great performance by Star Trek's frequent guest star, Jeffrey Combs (who most Star Trek fans recognize from his several appearances as a variety of aliens on several of the Trek series), as he struggles to balance his loyalty to his home world and his obvious respect and admiration for Capt.

Possibly there was an overwhelming urge to toss the popular Jeff Coombs into the story again as Captain Shran and the need to find a vehicle for him and the rest of the Andorrians. Perhaps there was not enough material available regarding the capture of the Xindi weapon to spin a whole episode, so the Andorrians were brought in as a combination of filler and distraction. Hard to say. But regardless, the episode, though entertaining comes across as a little formulaic and over-stuffed.The Enterprise is forced to employ the assistance of Captain Shran the Andorrian and his crew in order to obtain the prototype Xindi planet destroyer they recently disabled, but Archer is concerned about how far he can trust them.Shran's character developed nicely and Combs, as usual, turns in a great performance.

Watching him taking and carrying out orders he wholeheartedly disagrees with give Shran a multifaceted character many of the regulars on Enterprise never get to show. His acting is superb on this one and makes me greatly disappointed that he was never made a regular cast member.

They're one of the best things to come out of ST:E and I love the character of Shran; Jeffrey Combs does a marvelous job with his character. While I do enjoy the Andorians appearance, this season's entire plot premise is beginning to look problematic. 1) If the Xindi are looking to destroy the human race, why would they tip their hand by using that smaller weapon to piss off Earth? That still makes 0 sense to me. 2) Why would they need to test this smaller weapon if they've already used the other one to attack Earth? Shouldn't they be focusing on the larger death ray rather than continuing with this small fry nonsense? This weapon's clearly not large enough to destroy Earth if it can't handle this moon. Maybe the Xindi underestimated how hard it would be to blow up Earth and thought the original weapon would get the job done and now they're backpedaling; that's the only explanation that makes sense to me. Besides this (major) plot hole, another enjoyable episode of Season 3. Hopefully we get a better understanding of the Xindi's intentions in the future that can help explain this.",8

The Germans spent a little time letting him get comfortable with the idea that it was OK to talk about the invasion since the war was over. He dodges this still uncomfortable talking about that which was so secret so recently. As time goes by he starts to notice subtle flaws in the charade the German's are attempting.

But he IS a prisoner and the plan is to get him to relax his guard and betray what he knows about the pending invasion of the continent. Well, this is pretty much the set-up for this Trek show--as the crew of Enterprise is trying to convince someone that reality ISN'T what they think.When the show begins, Archer and Degra (the guy who created the Xindi super-weapon) are on a shuttle. Degra has no idea who Archer is nor how they got there. So, Archer gives him a fake back story about how they both were prisoners in a Xindi Insectoid prison and that they both just escaped and Degra's amnesia will soon pass. So why are they doing all this? Because they want to know where the place is where they're constructing the super-weapons so they can destroy them.

Everyone just appears to be taking this at face value. Shouldn't we ask them why they think we're out to destroy them? Whose behind this intel?

Third, Enterprise locates a capsule in space where there is a dying alien-- and when they rescue him and try to save him, the alien is angry!! What's with all the anger in this episode?!This is not a particularly good episode. The macho theatrics are, at times, a bit embarrassing. In addition, it's obvious that the show is willing to do anything to get fans--including showing LOTS of skin. The opening scene and a sex scene between T'Pol and Trip (with LOTS of skin on T'Pol's part) make it obvious how desperate the makes of the show have become in order to get folks to watch.

Time will tell. These training exercises we see in this episode are insane. Nobody trains like that! The entire crew would end up in the infirmary. They have no protection, no headgear or anything. I find this hard to believe, even if their medical procedures are more advanced. The alien in this episode looks like a Suliban that got left out in the sun too long. We never get a clear picture of who he is exactly or what his mission is. We only find out that he's part of the Xindi plot at the very, very end. He brings up more questions than answers: Is his species the one that instigated this conflict between the humans and the Xindis? Why can he walk through walls one minute and can't the next?

However, over time, Phlox starts going batty--perhaps caused by that part of space or his overactive imagination...or both. Regardless, after a while Phlox starts seeing all sorts of things that cannot be real but totally terrify him. He's so scared that he even considers wakening some of the crew...though T'Pol manages to calm him and talk him through the worst of it. At the very end comes an amazing twist that makes this otherwise unremarkable episode well worth seeing.In many ways, IMDb is right that the show is highly reminiscent of the episode from ""The Twilight Zone"" with William Shatner where he is a passenger on a plane who thinks he's seen a monster on the wing destroying the aircraft.

It's pretty clear early on that Phlox is the only conscious one aboard (why else would GE be trained on commanding the bridge if T'Pol was awake as well?). So the big reveal at the end where we learn that T'Pol was a figment of his imagination the whole time had no weight or substance to it, at least in my case. This episode is well acted, John Billingsley & Jolene Blalock always do a fine job; but the stakes never feel high and nothing exciting really occurs.

1,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Hatchery (TV Episode 2004)","Casual fan, really enjoyed this episode","From the perspective of someone who never thought to write about a Star Trek episode, I found this one to not just be worth mentioning, but worth creating an IMDb account to do it. I know, weird. This is my first time watching the series, but I found the acting in Hatchery to be some of the best in the show to-date (well, to- episode). The entire midway arc was amazing. My favorite scene was when T'Pol volunteered to inform Archer of the decision to delay his orders. They made you feel this was an important admission by Trip. Archer and him had been friends for years, but he trusted T'Pol's relationship with the Captain, and her ability to find common ground with him. This was their first time deliberately sabotaging his orders, and Trip and Reed deferred to her ability to bear the brunt of it. I disagree with a previous review which said this was a completely irrational dilemma. I don't believe it was as cut and dry as they presented. The Senior Staff were very clearly struggling with their own compassion. It wasn't until the mission was beginning to be genuinely compromised (losing 1/3 of their warp/weapon MagicFuel reserves). Their later actions came not from disagreeing with Archer's sense of honor and compassion, but from his completely out- of-character and extreme solution to the conflict. For those watching through it, the presence of a conspiracy is confused by both sides having a convincing argument containing believable mixes of compassion vs duty. As a bonus, this is where the (imo) interesting conflict between Reed and Hayes reached the forehead-wipe moment. After the Captain blew the whole feud open, Reed swallows his pride and gives respect where its due to Hayes, a pivotal change in their story. Whatever happens after this (and I could be totally wrong, Reed just might get his knickers twisted into knots again) the acting made it feel like it was the real deal.",10
2,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Hatchery (TV Episode 2004)",Filler in the Xindi Arc,"The problem with The Hatchery is that it is a very highly improbable self-contained story which is connected to the Xindi story arc, and which introduces some very radical concepts which never emerge again in the arc. In other words, it is a bit of filler within a story arc which had no room for filler.Enterprise discovers a hatchery for Xindi Insectoids aboard a wrecked insectoid ship and Archer decides to try to save the offspring for humanistic reasons. Obsessed, he loses sleep and his grip on reality and begins dismissing his senior officers when they fail to anticipate his command decisions.The dynamics between four of the principal characters (Archer, T'Pol, Tucker and Reed) are examined in this episode, but are presented in a way which is consistent with most of the series. The story presents some rather extreme new ideas, but these are never really made use of again later in the series. Instead of what should have been a pivotal episode, the audience is left wondering why this filler episode was necessary.Bakula uncharacteristically overacts the manic and obsessed Archer, and Blalock, Trineer and Keating carry the episode. Mike Grossman's directing is admirable, considering what he had to work with in terms of story.",5
3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Hatchery (TV Episode 2004)","The show so screwy, doing the right thing is an evil ploy!","So in this one, the Enterprise finds a Xindi Insectoid ship where all the Insectoids are dead. It's discovered they drained their power and sacrificed themselves in order to keep a hatchery full of their young operational and keep them alive.Shockingly, Archer's reaction is not that of the redneck Trip, which is to burn the eggs alive like butchers, but to save them and care for them. Not only is this the humane thing to do, since these insectoids are sentient AND infants, but it's the politically and morally wise thing to do, considering that the Xindi consider the Humans a savage race out to destroy the Xindi, which is the WHOLE REASON THEY ATTACKED EARTH, and the WHOLE THING THAT WILL BE Proved IF THEY LET THESE XINDI CHILDREN DIE.SHOCKINGLY, Archer justifies himself in a sensible, coherent way, including a story of how his great-grandfather fought in the Eugenics War, and had a confrontation in North Africa with the enemy, and they agreed to a ceasefire long enough to evacuate a school full of children between their lines of fire.SHOCKINGLY, EVERYONE BUT ARCHER DISAGREES WITH THIS, AND THINKS THEY SHOULD ABANDON THESE XINDI HATCHLINGS AND GO ABOUT THEIR MISSION, EVEN THOUGH HELPING THEM IS JUST A SLIGHT SIDETRACK IN THEIR MISSION! So, UNshockingly, this is of course some sort of evil brainwashing by the Xindi and not anything remotely resembling a moral dilemma or conflict of ideals that can be handled in a mature, enlightening way. Nope, that's just too much for the simple-minded mediocrity of Enterprise, and Archer's care for the Xindi hatchlings becomes a COMICAL OBSESSION with them that ends with Archer with three little insectoids crawling all around his shoulders while he incoherently tries to get Trip to not kill them.So a potentially great episode involving moral conflicts and a difficult situation of there being no clear-cut right and wrong, black or white, is squandered in exchange for bio-technobabble, as it's explained that the egg-sack's squirting stuff on Archer in the beginning of the episode ""reverse imprints"" on his brain, essentially doing the opposite of what happens with Humans---children become mentally ""programmed"" to be attached to their adult caretaker. In this case, the adult caretaker becomes ""programmed"" to be attached to the Insectoids.This leads into the cheap cop-out of an ending where they leave the Xindi hatchlings alone in the ship, with no more than a ""tough s***, good luck"", essentially abandoning them and hoping a Xindi ship will find them eventually.Imagine if a nursery full of Human babies was found by an alien species, and these aliens went OUT OF THEIR WAY to care for these babies, keep them safe, before the crew mutinied and then left those babies alone on their big space ship for Humans to find later on.How long would it take for them to be found by other Humans? Days? Weeks? Months? Even if those babies somehow survived, how psychologically destroyed would they be? These are the sorts of things that could make for a great show. Enterprise proves, EVEN in its best storyline idea (the Xindi arc), that it is far from a great show.",1
4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Hatchery (TV Episode 2004)",Archer is completely justified in this.,"I really enjoyed this episode, however as said above...I think Archer was right. It feels stupid that they would justify his behavior (as if it needed justification) with an infection from an alien liquid. Archer is completely justified in this. He's saving the children. everyone else on board is against saving the children. They mutiny against him and try to make him look insane. I just find it inexcusable that so many people would not see the logic behind his actions (T'Pol even calls the idea illogical). Indeed saving the hatchlings would have shed some new light on the humans to Xindi and potentially stopped them from considering the destruction of the Earth. Nobody aside from Archer even takes it into consideration for a second.",7
5,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Hatchery (TV Episode 2004)","Boy, Some People Are Pretty Upset","While I thought this episode was quite odd, I thought it was OK. There is one factor that floors me involving the creative team. An away crew with full protective suits goes to a place alien to them. As soon as they know the air has the right composition, off goes the suit. They don't wear any gloves when they handle things. They grasp substances that could be toxic, at least unfamiliar. Archer would never have been hit in the face if it had not been for his removing his gear. The only reason I can think of is that you can't have an episode of people walking around in space suits. Yes, the Xindi are producing children, but a true directive would have been to leave well enough alone. It's their world and their process. The issue is what is happening to the Captain and the danger presented by the situation. Their mission trumps (excuse my profanity) other things. There are billions on earth who will die. The belief that earth will destroy the Xindi is wrong--they have been misinformed or have some misguided belief. To bolster them is not in the best interest of the mission, to save earth from them. I know there is some moral dilemma here, but not believing in an after-life, the whole business of sacrificing the lives of an entire civilization is too much.",8

It's so bad that some of the crew begin questioning whether they should mutiny instead of follow his insane orders.The problem is that every person watching this show KNOWS exactly why Archer is behaving weirdly. However, inexplicably, no one on the ship seems to realize why the Captain is acting strangely until much later in the show--too late to be realistic. A decent but flawed episode.",6

8,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Hatchery (TV Episode 2004)","What on Earth was the point of putting the ""Star Trek"" brand on this episode?","There's no spoilers here, since it's made clear very early in the episode: this is an episode, purportedly of a ""Star Trek"" series (the series name itself was changed during this very season to include ""Star Trek"") where the crew of the Enterprise encounters a nursery full of alien infants in enemy territory, and decides, in the end, to leave them to die, because the only way, the show informs us, that we'd want to save the lives of infants born to our enemies is if we were affected by insidious mind control. It's sick, and I wouldn't subject my children to this filth.The captain insists that they do what they can to care for these infants for the sake of the crew's own humanity. Again, I want to stress: these are helpless infants. It's already bogglingly against the message behind ""Star Trek"", its CORE message, that the crew would disagree with this assessment. It's even worse that the captain's passionate - and correct - defense of his decisions only exists, per this episode, because he's been poisoned by the infants early on in the episode. Poisoned, I guess, with even an ounce of human feeling or compassion, otherwise absent from this episode!At the show's apparent attempt at a climax, we're invited by camera angles, lighting, musical cues and the response of other characters, to feel disgust and horror that the Captain would allow these infants to touch his pristine body. We're supposed to feel disgust not because these infants are malevolent villains in disguise or anything like that, but because THEY LOOK DIFFERENT FROM US. BECAUSE THEY LOOK DIFFERENT, and FOR NO OTHER REASON, even though they are INNOCENT INFANTS, we're supposed to be disgusted by their touch and wish them dead, and to view their survival as secondary to the mission of bombing the enemy! There is no ""Star Trek"" to be found here.Anyone who has ever watched even a single other episode of ""Star Trek"", unless they are completely unable to grasp the message behind it, would agree: whether or not you agree with this (repulsive) conclusion, it is COMPLETELY antithetical to the message of the show going back to its very foundation. Extremely disappointing - again, I would not for a second expose my children to the message behind this episode, and I suggest you do not do the same. Whether you wish to subject yourself to it is your business: it's a great example of how severely this show went astray at the time.",1

After being sprayed with a neurotoxin found aboard, Archer becomes protective of the eggs to an obsessive degree, jeopardizing the mission. A munity against Archer and the MACO members has to be done to save the ship and its mission. I'm kind of conflicted about this one. While yes, Archer did go overboard with his protection of the eggs, the conclusion of the episode almost makes it seem like it was wrong of the Enterprise to save the eggs instead of going at them with a blowtorch as Trip suggested. These are innocent creatures and it seems to fall within the Star Trek philosophy to want to save them from sure demise. But at a certain point, the mission must take precedence; it's a fine line. But everyone seems to think Archer crazy for wanting to save them. I suppose they are on a time crunch which ""justifies"" this... Like I said, I'm conflicted. I understand people's anger at the way the show portrays the interaction between Archer and the Xindi babies. They frame it to be horrific to the viewer which is just plain wrong. We're suppose to abhor them because they're different, a terrible message. It's also pretty obvious early on that Archer's been compromised by the eggs. The ending comes as no surprise to anyone watching. One interesting thing of note is how the show portrays the military outfit as all ""yes men"", obeying Archer's orders even as they get more ludicrous. Maybe this episode will change Hayes mentality moving forward. On we go to Azati Prime!",3

The pathos the episode is capable to transmit is at very high level, making it very close to episodes like ""the best of both worlds"" in TNG or ""Angels' Sacrifice"" in DS9. The episode is a turning point of the whole season, things will happen differently and faster after it. Emotions, honor and battle are the main topics of the episode, and some stress-driven decisions will hit the spectators for the lack of humanity, a concept often shown during season three of Enterprise. 40 minutes of pure star trek style that are likely to be the most remembered of the series. One certain thing is that you won't be able to wait for the following episodes after seeing at this one.",10

Trip and Mayweather propose to use the Insectoid shuttle to cross the grid and investigate the exact location of the Xindi weapon. They find the compound underwater and return to the Enterprise where Archer assumes the responsibility to make a trip without return with the shuttle loaded with two torpedoes to destroy the facility. However, the time agent Daniels brings Archer to the future and tells him that the enemies of the Xindi are the trans-dimensional beings and Archer should convince the Xindi that humans are not the menace to their planet. Archer does not accept the argument, travels to Azati Prime but is captured and tortured. Without any other alternative, he manages to convince Degra and two other members of the council that he might be telling the truth, while the Enterprise is attacked by the Xindi reptiles.The tense and dramatic ""Azati Prime"" is one of the best episodes of the Fourth Season, with Archer trying to negotiate with the Xindi instead of attacking. It seems that the Xindi breeds begin to understand who their real enemies are. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Azati Prime""",9
2,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Azati Prime (TV Episode 2004)","Time Travel, torture, comedy and a lot of action","Here we have the preculmination to the season three Xindi arc that leads us on a wild ride and leaves us with a crazy wild conclusion. This episode takes all the information that we have been accumulating for the last ten episodes and gives us an action packed thrill ride that would have been a satisfying season finale. ""Azati Prime"" runs the gambit giving us further developments on several main and secondary characters, time travel, torture, comedy, and a lot of action.The episode begins slowly, but once it kicks in it goes full steam ahead. Early on we are treated to splendid character development of our main characters Archer and T'Pol along with my second favorite Enterprise secondary character, Degra. We get to see what this mission to save humanity has done to Archer as we see him killing three Xindi without provocation and later the emotional toll that his decisions previously in the season have made him willing to stop the killing by sacrificing himself. We get to see the emotional problems T'Pol is facing after her Trellium-D exposure and losing her Captain and friend. Although we are treated to some of Degra's misgivings about this mission in the previous episode ""Strategem"", it comes back full circle and explains his decision to finally help Archer. Degra's emotional state is reminiscent of atomic scientists after their construction of the atom bomb. After this great character development we are given some great action only compared to by a few movies and DS9 that ends this episode on a high note and sets up the remainder of the Xindi arc. This one is a wonderful episode that relies on many different story telling elements to give us a fun and dramatic ride.",8

Along the way, they've picked up a Xindi insectoid ship and Archer plans on flying the ship on a suicide mission to blow up the super weapon. However, the recurring character of the galactic time cop brings Archer 400 years into the future and tells him NOT to fly that mission--he's needed to meet with the Xindi and make them his new BFFs. But Archer inexplicably decides to fly the mission anyway--and you KNOW it's going to fail...but he does it anyway. What's next? Lots of violence and chaos and action and stuff...This is a very good episode for anyone who is tired of all the episodes leading up to the Xindi confrontation, as it's now here and the show is one crazy action scene after another. You know that the crew MUST survive all this because the other Trek shows all occur AFTER this one...but how?!",9

After getting caught, he must resort to Daniels' strategy of negotiation to try to stop the weapon's implementation; his unknown knowledge of Degra assists in this. Meanwhile, the Enterprise is being overwhelmed by Reptilian Xindi ships and must fight for survival. This episode really packed a punch! I don't even like Archer that much but really felt for him as he gave his goodbye speech (even though we all knew there was no way he'd die in this fashion). The finally images of Enterprise being destroyed really added to the dire mood of this episode, the bodies being sucked out into space by the holes in the hull. This felt like a season finale yet we still have a handful of episodes left to go.",9

Archer decides to fly it himself because he feels he can't be responsible for any more killing. Unfortunately, he is captured before he can deliver the payload. Prior to his departure he receives a visit from Andrews who tells him that he must not die on this mission. The future would be changed with horrible results. He must survive and he must negotiate. Archer won't buy this and goes off. He has been given artifact from the future to negotiate with. The warm blooded Xindi are somewhat receptive because they are analytical, but the reptilian seem to control things. As the episode ends, the Enterprise comes under deadly attack with great loss of life and damage. Certainly, one of the most exciting episodes in Star Trek history.",10
0,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Damage (TV Episode 2004)",This episode must have PO'd many Trekkers.,"This is Enterprise version of ""In the Pale Moonlight"" from Deep Space 9. In both episodes, The Sisko and The Archer have to toss Ethics out the nearest Airlock in order to accomplish a more important Goal. For The Sisko it was to get The Romulans to scrag their ""Non Aggression Pact"" with The Dominion, for Archer, the stakes are just as high.The Xindi are almost finished with their Planet-Obliterating weapon, And Enterprise is falling to bits.The one difference between what happened ""In the Pale Moonlight"" and here is, in ""Pale Moonlight"", nobody else other than Elim Garak knew what had been done. But in ""Damage"", it had to be done with the Enterprise Senior Crew participation.Casey Biggs shows up as yet another Alien, he was Legate Damar on DS9. Tucker Smallwood (From Space: Above and Beyond) is a Xindi council member, and for the first time we get to see one of the ""Sphere Builders"", played by Josette DiCarlo. Also, Scott Macdonald (Who was ""Tosk"" in DS9 and a Romulan Subcommander in TNG) is the main Reptilian Commander, who shows up for a few minutes at the beginning of this debacle.The ""B"" Story in this episode is T'Pol's struggle with a sensitive issue, and it is driving her to take crazy life threatening chances.All in All, many things are happening in this pivotal Ep. If I had seen this back when it was originally aired, I know I would have hated it. I despised this show for many years, on the basis of ""These are the Voyages"", but this was unfair to the 97 other great episodes this show produced. I am finally able to watch this show from start to finish, and it is much better than I remember. Probably because when I watched it On Air, all I had was a crummy 24"" Magnavox TV, and it was broadcast in 4:3 rather than the 16:9 format I'm seeing it in now. And 7.1 Surround sound. Never knew the deck-plates of NX01 hummed like in TNG.",10
1,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Damage (TV Episode 2004)",Ethical Choices/T'Pol on Drugs,"A lot is made of ethical choices all along the way. Let's start with the face that only in the most pure state, do people manage to stick to purely ethical standards. The biggest issue here is the stealing of the warp coil from the alien ship. Archer fights against every argument, and while he leaves the people stranded, he kills no one and he gives them something in return. In the purest sense, it is still wrong. But these are trying times with no way out right now. The ship is badly damaged and many have already died. How far do we stretch the morality thing when the taking of life is not involved. Yes, the white hatted cowboy didn't do this but his enemy was the black hat and he didn't threaten the world he lived on.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Damage (TV Episode 2004)",Guerilla Warfare,"Thanks to the Xindi Council's decision to call off the attack by the Reptilian ships, the crew of the Enterprise is able to survive (for the most part) the cliffhanger we were left with last episode. In ""Damage"" the crew attempts to repair the Enterprise and get it back functioning. In a show of good faith the Council gives Archer back to the ship, not worrying about the Enterprise being able to escape in its current state. But when the Enterprise encounters another damaged ship, Archer must decide whether he wants to cross an ethical line and steal the ship's warp coil to continue on Enterprise's mission. In this episode's subplot, we learn that T'Pol has been secretly abusing Trellium D, injecting it into her bloodstream; she is now suffering from addiction and withdrawal. T'Pol's substance abuse was something I didn't see coming, although it does explain her emotional episodes (by Vulcan terms) she's been experiencing for much of the season (i.e. her sexual relationship with Trip). I just assumed it was a product of spending so much time with primarily humans. We'll have to see how her emotions are affected moving forward. The Enterprise has really transformed into a guerilla outfit as of late: stealthily destroying outposts, attempted suicide bombings, ""provisioning"" supplies from civilian ships. The crew is going down a dark path. The ""do whatever it takes"" attitude of wartime Enterprise may lead to irreversible harm. I understand Archer's decision to steal the warp coil, it seems to be consistent with his character. He seems more likely to cross that ethical line than the rest of the crew but he knows exactly what's at stake, not just Earth but all the other planets in the future timeline. The justification makes sense, even if it isn't consistent with future Star Trek protocol. This show is about humans first years in space, mistakes are bound to be made. There's a reason Vulcans didn't want us wandering around out there.",8

Captain Archer is sent back in an aquatic pod and evaluates the damage report. When a ship with problems caused by the anomalies hails the Enterprise, Archer proposes to trade their warp engine by Trellium and supplies, but the other captain does not accept the offer. When Archer decodes Degra's message calling him to a meeting with the Xindi council scheduled in three days, Archer decides to use force and take the warp coil by force from the aliens. Meanwhile T'Pol goes to the sick bay and tells Dr. Phlox that she is addicted in Trellium and unable to control her emotions.In ""Damage"", Captain Archer crosses the line of ethics and steals the warp engine of an alien ship using the maximum that the end justifies the means that recalls the behavior of many governors of the Twentieth and the Twentieth Centuries that think in the same way. I personally hated this despicable episode and I believe the author could have written a better action to be taken considering the moral character of Archer. I do not agree with the destruction of his moral and ethical principles in such easy way. In the rest, the saga of the Enterprise goes on, but not as noble as it has been along the other seventy episodes. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Relatório de Danos"" (""Damage Reports"")",7

However, Archer is still being held--but now it's with the Aquatics. Oddly, he's knocked out and when he awakens, he's being welcomed back aboard Enterprise. Apparently the Aquatics put him in a tiny capsule and launched him back to his ship. Why did they releases Archer? At the same time a battered Archer is brought aboard and he's planning a raiding party to steal a Xindi warp coil, T'Pol is starting to fall apart. She is an emotional mess and argues, very emotionally, with the Captain about his plan to steal the device. After all, it's a slippery moral slope and his disregard for ethics is scary. This is a very good and exciting episode...no doubt about it. The show is full of action, plot twists and ethical dilemmas. But it also brings up a few minor questions. First, why is the space suit that T'Pol uses so crappily made? It is the 23nd century after all! Also, whenever you see the Aquatics, they're in water that is kinda yellowish. Is this Aquatics pee? And finally, showing naked folks would seem to indicate that the producers of the show are willing to try ANYTHING to get folks to watch the show. Am I right?

He would have found some other way to do what needed to be done. I do not think he would go against his morals and ethics in that way.

This may be the only episode of Star Trek ever, any series, any era, that has ever made me cry. Extremely powerful and layered with a masterful performance by Connor Trinneer that won't be forgotten. Even Jolene Blylock brought levels to her performance not previously seen. John Billingsley, in just a few scenes rounded out his caring doctor with beautiful acting. Randy Oglesby guests as Degra who plays an honorable and conflicted weapons developer who convincingly changes sides when presented with new information. Absolutely every aspect was top notch. The thing is, so much of what is great about this episode hinges on the earlier episodes of the season and so it is very welcome to feel somewhat validated for having slogged through the whole Xindi story arc and finally get to an episode which made all that work worth it. And, hey, it had a cameo from Seth McFarlane, so you got that too.

They all tell the story of what happens when the ship finally reaches the Xindi ultimate weapon and how the humans and Xindi somehow make peace. This particular episode features two of the Xindi species (the most human-like by the way) spending time with Captain Archer and discussing a possible peace between everyone. However, it's obvious that the Reptilian Xindi are rather insane and warlike and would LOVE to vaporize the Earth. What also soon becomes obvious is that some of the crew hate the Xindi and just want to kill them--Trip, of course, being among them because of the murder of his sister by their first weapon. Despite this, Degra makes a fateful decision-- one that definitely makes a HUGE departure of the humanoid Xindi from the alliance.All in all, like all the recent episodes, this one is full of action and tension--and make it among the best episodes of season three.

When the hostiles Reptilians threaten the Enterprise, Degra takes a surprising attitude.The Fourth Season of Enterprise now is excellent, actually with one long story split in episodes.

Very little action highlights this wonderful episode about internal struggles. From struggles keeping the ship together while everything that can go wrong does to Degra's grappling with the thought of betraying his people and following the human he has been trying to exterminate, this episode touches on deep internal struggles of the ship and her crew and the action is secondary and kept to a reasonable minimum. This one hits all the right emotional buttons and is a standout among a season of high powered action.""The Forgotten"" is dominated by the acting of Connor Trinneer. His performance as Trip runs the gambit of exhaustion, anger, and pain that, put quite simply, is the greatest performance by any actor in the entire series. We are treated to an episode where Trip confronts the pain of his lost sister by running from it, directing anger towards the person responsible, and finally with a heartfelt emotional breakdown where he finally gives into the loss. The final moments of his acceptance hit you like a bulldozer and it is hard to keep your eyes from getting a bit watery. The rest of the story does a good job of pushing the Xindi arc forward with Archer finally convincing Degra to join his cause and help him save billions of lives. ""The Forgotten"" is an exceptionally well written, powerful, and heartfelt episode that slows down the action a little but delivers heavily on strong character development and emotional substance.",9

Debra goes rogue, destroying a Reptilian ship in order to keep an alliance with the humans and attempt to stop the weapon from use. Degra seems committed to helping the humans. We got a glimpse of this when he was captured and his mind wiped; he felt extremely saddened by the children and innocents that were to be killed by his weapon. Much like the atom bombs creators or Edward Nobel, Degra is a scientist that will live to see his work turned into a killing machine and will have to love with his regret. Besides this, this episode is fairly average. Trip is coping with the loss of his sister still and must write a letter to one of his workers' family after she died in the Xindi Reptilian attack. I don't like when shows try to make us care about the death of characters that we've had no previous interactions with. There's not much emotional weight to it if I never even realized that Jane Taylor existed prior to this episode. They're just using her for emotional fodder and I'm not buying it.",6

They must think of another plan to save Earth successfully. The presence of 2 Enterprises allows many of the crew to learn their fate in this timeline, to varying degrees of satisfaction regarding their futures.This episode hurts my brain. The fact that this season takes place in the Expanse (which doesn't abide by the normal laws of gravity, time, etc.) allows the writers a bit of free reign regarding normal plot holes and time paradoxes. They can just blame it all on the Expanse; on one hand it's a bit annoying but on the other it's cool that they can think outside the box a bit.Taking all that into consideration, I kind of liked this episode. I enjoyed how every character got to see their futures and how some seem to be planning on changing their outlook because of it (i.e. Reed or T'Pol). I also thought Blalock did an admirable job portraying T'Pol as an elderly Vulcan. it was smart of the director to leave her in a dark room so we couldn't really see the terrible prosthetics and makeup job I'm assuming they used for this character. We also got to further the plot more by arriving at Degra's meeting place, an added bonus. So, what did happen to the other Enterprise? Were they destroyed?

So, in case things don't go well, a mission goes by shuttle to try to enter one of the spheres in order to determine how to disable them. This episode is very exciting and offers lots of surprises and lots of action. Folks get killed, the council breaks apart into pieces and the episode ramps up towards a huge finale.

The head Reptilian kills Degra in an act of vengeance for Degra's ship destroying a Reptilian vessel. Reed, T'Pol, & Travis find access into a sphere and steal it's hard-drive?

The Reptilian ship transports Hoshi onto their own before escaping into the Expanse.This episode was a good build up to the upcoming finale. I'm sad to see Degra go. I'd really gotten attached to him as a character and enjoyed his story arc from weapons creator to human sympathizer. Maybe I missed something, but I never really picked up on why they needed T'Pol to head into the sphere. It kind of seemed like they needed some kind of other plot to be happening for other characters not involved with the Council so they threw this in.

The biggest problem is that the sphere builders, who continually take credit for everything that the Xindi had accomplished, have their own agenda. They can manipulate time and react when things don't go as they wished. They are a bit like the gods on Mt. Olympus, who caused events to take place and then reacted.

It reminded me very much of a Star Wars movie (hence my title) but it had enough Star Trek-esqueness to it to keep it feeling organic and exciting. This is the second straight episode that we've seen the passing of a tertiary character from the show. Major Hayes never felt like a fully fleshed out three dimensional character. I felt like I knew Degra far better than Hayes so his death really didn't have a huge emotional effect on me, especially since there are such higher stakes at hands regarding the future of the human race.

We were privy to all the factors involved, all set up well. There were two worthy adversaries. All forces were employed to face the possibility of destruction. Those Reptilians showed their disregard for life, but they trusted the wrong entities. Archer shows his utter heroism in the face of major consequences and other members of the crew were equally instrumental in all that transpired. We really get to see the humanity (and I used that term in the broadest sense) that was struck with all participants. I will hold my breath for the final season because what I saw in the last two minutes seems like a kind of warmed over Twilight Zone setup. Other than that, the third season made up for some rather up and down stories in the past.",10

NO!!!! Considering what a whiny thing she's been, then it looks like we are all screwed, right?! Well, maybe not.The episode begins with the super-weapon coming towards Earth--with Archer in Degra's lightly armed ship in pursuit. At the same time, Enterprise is on a mission to destroy a sphere--and hopefully destroy the network of spheres. In this show, there are lots of surprises--including a visit from my favorite character from the series. This one will keep your pulse pounding and is THE show to see from the series.

Archer takes Degra's ship (along with Hoshi & Reed) and chases after the weapon and the Reptilians defending it. Meanwhile, Trip & T'Pol take the Enterprise to one of the spheres within the Expanse. According to their calculations, destroying this sphere should destroy all of the others and make the Expanse a thing of the past.I have to say that I was a bit underwhelmed by this season finale. I enjoyed the fight scenes with Archer and the head Reptilian. I enjoyed Shran's apperance. I enjoyed the Enterprise vs. Sphere-Builder standoff. I enjoyed the way the sphere made the crew's skin crack... But still, something was missing. We never learn why the Sphere-Builders are attempting to take over our dimension. Why go through all this trouble?I couldn't help but laugh when I saw the ending: Alien Nazis?! Excuse me?! I hope that this doesn't waste too much of our time in Season 4. Not too excited for that.

I almost never watch the scenes after he gets back; it's like they don't exist to me! OK, time to calm down and do some serious explaining.The ""future"" scenes take place in the apocalyptic future created by pulling Acher through time, or rather out of history before his time but they don't notice that. meanwhile Enterprise has been taken over by Silik and his soldiers who ""need instructions"". The problem is that future guy doesn't exist anymore than the monument. (the one Daniels was so concerned about?) Archer and Daniels are equally perplexed by the disastrous world they find them selves in. But while Archer can't seem to find time for all his questions, Daniels is quite, yet quietly puzzled and(obeying the temporal prime directive we've heard so much about) proportionately tight-lipped.Seriously whether you like time-travel episodes or not this one should be fun.Most Enterprise episodes bringing up the federation at all are above par: this one is stellar! The writing, acting plot and settings/set are very realistic and very masterfull. Download it if you can! if not.. there are other ways to see star trek.",8

Additionally, they'll have to use what technology they can fabricate to try to get back to the past and stop the Suliband.This is a rather exciting episode, though I actually thought part one was a bit more exciting. Regardless, the story is quite good and it made for a good season ending/beginning series. It also further solidified the notion that some of the Vulcans (especially the ambassador) are jerks. Well worth seeing.",8
3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Shockwave, Part II (TV Episode 2002)",Ready for Another Season,"The Enterprise is in danger of being scrubbed from its mission. This episode involves an effort to change time and allow a victory over the Suliban. There is a good deal of violence against the crew after Archer disappears. T'Pol and the others, must act without him while he attempts contact with them. I'm sure there are all sorts of intriguing mistakes involving the realities of time. Daniels, like Q in later incarnations of Star Trek, is one of those characters that is so far above the weak possibilities of humans that he throws a bit of a monkey wrench into the verisimilitude of the show. Nevertheless, this is very entertaining and sets up a second season very well.",9
4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Shockwave, Part II (TV Episode 2002)",Back from the Future,"Season 2 kicks off right where the finale of Season 1 left us. Archer's stuck in the future with no way back, the Enterprise is surrounded by Suliban ships, there is little to no hope for the crew. How will they get out of this one? While this was an okay episode, I really was hoping for a more prolonged conflict. Archer spends all of 5 minutes in the future before figuring out a way back to his time and place. It would have been nice seeing him in that desolate place struggling a bit longer, trying to figure out how to get back. It also would have been nice seeing how the crew could manage without their Captain. Instead, he tricks the Cabal into bringing him back and hijacks a pod to return to the Enterprise.Some of the crew's hijinks made me roll my eyes in this one. Hoshi's ""hilarious"" wardrobe malfunction had no place in this one and really left me scratching my head. I am also quickly tiring of Trip and the acting ability (or lack there of) of Connor Trinneer.Besides this, a pretty auspicious start to Season 2.",7
5,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Shockwave, Part II (TV Episode 2002)",well...,"With 10 minutes remaining, Archer slugs Silik, and Silik's ""uniform"" slips - revealing human flesh.I would like to make believe that this editorial slip is symptomatic of the episode and the show, but i cannot.This episode, and its prequel are by and large fairly well done, and the time ""invasion"" thread does stand out. In fact, time travel is handled in this show in a manner consistent with time travel throughout the Star Trek canon ( tho' time travel was never Star Trek's strong suit).While i enjoy this series, mostly, i find more fault with this one (and the re-booted movies), than I do with earlier ones.My difficulties: not proceeding into the future, the worsening relations with Vulcan, the theme song, some of the casting (most of the casting), and trivial matters.My biggest problem is the ""revisionist"" nature of this and others. Previously, Roddenberry provided the view that we make our own futures, and there is enough good in humanity (and the universe in general), that the future WILL be better than the past. His view forces one to a non-dystopian viewpoint regardless of how the world seems to be doing at any quasi-current period.",6
0,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Carbon Creek (TV Episode 2002)",The Most Excellent Trek episode of All Treks,"And it embodies the Spirit of Trek, all of Gene Roddenberry's ideas are here in one fell swoop in this swell episode of ""Enterprise"".Writer/Producer Dan O'Shannon of Cheers and Frasier worked well with Brannon and Rick to create this peep into Vulcan/Human history - And not one Temporal Causality Loop, Suliban Temporal Transporter, or any Department of Temporal Investigations Agents were used, this is a true Period Piece, true to the depicted Terran History around the time of Sputnik. I know, because I lived in that time. And this is how it looked.Although T'Pol is telling this Fish Tale to Archer and Tripp, the character who wins the big prize is ""Mestral"" played by the great J. Paul Boehmer, who adds Vulcan to his list of Trek Aliens - He has been a Cardassian, a Borg, and a Nazi Soldier in Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise. This is perhaps his best character and a most Logical Vulcan.I had reviewed the Vulcan Enterprise Episodes of Season Four and had commented that the Vulcans were no longer acting like Vulcans, instead acting like angst and testosterone ridden teenagers with only Pon Farr on their minds.Here, the characters of T'Pol/T'Mir and Mestral as well as ""Stron"" (Michael Krawic) and ""Captain Tellus"" (Ron Marasco) are true Vulcans, following the standards set by Leonard Nimoy, Mark Lenard (""Sarek""), Zachary Quinto, Tim Russ, and Alexander Enberg (""Vorik"" from Voyager and ""Taurik"" from Next Generation Season 7 ""Lower Decks""). I was pleased to see this, because Leonard Nimoy had set a Standard for Vulcans in The Original Series and all of those actors had followed suit to perfection.The Season Four Enterprise ""Vulcan Trilogy"" The Forge, The Awakening, and Kir'Shara had changed Vulcans into petty, squabbling politicians and it is just not believable that they would act as they did, speak as they did, with venom and deceit.But here, they do justice to all Vulcan canon.This is why I consider this episode not just the best of Enterprise, but of the whole Trek Franchise. In The Original Series, the Vulcans were basically the heart of the show. Later, Klingons, Romulans, Ferengi, Bajorans and Cardassians and even Vorta and Jem'Hadar were added to the lists of uncountable Aliens. In all of Trek, we have seen parades of unidentified Aliens, drinking in Bars, sitting at the Helm, walking the corridors of The Enterprises, Serving bar in Ten Forward, and as Senators serving the Federation Council and even as Presidents of the Federation.This episode was presented without gimmicks, without Technobabble and with a lot of Humanity. And it is probably the most touching depiction of T'Pol in the whole run of the show.In making shows about Aliens, Trek quite successfully at times reflects on The Human Condition-Especially in the Interactions with ""Hoomans"". In Quark we saw a Barkeep with real heart, in Odo, we could see the Entire Human Race and that the good outweighs the bad. But The Vulcans are perhaps the best friends Humanity has ever had. It is in our exploration of Vulcanity that Humanity can be really be observed.Ironically, Archer and Tripp think T'Pol had pulled their legs. Vulcans can imply, obfuscate, and misdirect, but Vulcans Never Lie.",10

With Trip and Archer playing a very small supporting role... it's all T'Pol.It's a fun well done episode. Light hearted, reminded me of ""Coneheads"", but with some touching moments (my wife cried at one scene). Much of Enterprise tries to answer question from early Star Trek Series... the first Holodeck, the beginning of transporting humans, etc; this episode does that with First Contact... making first Contact the Second Contact.***major spoilers below***I agree with the review that the ""great grandmother"" might has been T'Pol herself, her mother or T'Pol might even be the daughter of the Vulcan who was left behind. It would have been fun if they would have come back to this episode in a later show.",9
2,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Carbon Creek (TV Episode 2002)",My favorite Star Trek episode.,"Identifying what is or is not one's favorite of anything is strictly a personal endeavor. I'm more than sure I'm probably the only trekkie/er on the planet (or universe) that identifies 'Carbon Creek' as their favorite Star Trek episode.It seems the least expensive episodes ring stronger for me. TNG's Inner Light, ENT's Shuttlepod One, DS9's Explorer's, VOY's 11:59 to name a few.Carbon Creek wasn't just a ""filler"" episode made to conserve money to make up for other more graphic intensive episodes, it had a purpose. This episode not only revealed some interesting unknown Star Trek history, but provided a needed back-story for the character T'Pol.This is a wonderful, heartwarming story. At this point in the series, T'Pol continually takes abuse for being 'Vulcan' even though she has time and time again proved unwavering loyalty to her Captain, the mission and the crew of Enterprise. So why does she put up with this? Until this episode we really had no idea and didn't know much about her background at all.While she doesn't reveal the 'truth' to Archer and Trip over dinner, she does indicate to us by revealing her ""mother's mother's mother's"" purse that the story she has told us is true. One can only imagine the impact her grandmother had on a young T'Pol, telling stories of her experiences with humans, etc. Now we can surmise why she volunteered to serve on Enterprise and moreover why she decided to remain aboard when she has had the opportunity to leave. T'Mir was an explorer that ended up gaining firsthand experience with humans while being stranded on Earth in 1957. Humans intrigued her and she passed that curiosity and interest on to her granddaughter.We see how important education is to T'Mir and we see how she just can't fathom that a brilliant kid wouldn't be afforded an opportunity to receive a higher education. T'Mir's introduction of Velcro technology fit nicely into history as we know it. The first Velcro was completely made from cotton when Georges de Mestral, a Swiss engineer, patented the zipperless zipper 1955. The problem was the cotton hooks quickly stopped doing what Velcro does as they quickly wore out. Nylon had been around since 1935. It wasn't until shortly after Velcro was patented that Mestral discovered that nylon worked much better than cotton (circa 1958) because it didn't wear out nearly as fast with use. Seeing Maggie's expression as she found the money in the tip jar realizing her son could go to college was priceless.Listening to baseball on the radio, bus rides, 'I Love Lucy', 'Moe', old vehicles, frozen fish sticks, family owned restaurants, the small coal-town atmosphere all added to the realness of this episode. The lighter tone during the encounters between humans and our Vulcans was fun.It would have been nice for the series to revisit Mestral, but they did not. We can only assume he melded in nicely and contributed to human advancement where he could.So this episode links Star Trek's future with humanities past and provides back-story for a main character that gives some justification for her continued interest in serving with humans on a star ship. All done with humor and knowledge of our real past that makes this occurrence as plausible as they come in trek.Well done, Rick Berman & Brannon Braga & Dan O'Shannon, well done. So the next time you see T'Pol unveil her Great Grandmother's purse, I hope you give this review a thought and I hope you might appreciate this Star Trek gem little more.",10
3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Carbon Creek (TV Episode 2002)",T'Pol tells a story,"This episode is frequently sited by fans of Enterprise as their favorite episode of the series. Ironically, most of the show takes place, not on the ship or even in the future, but in Earth's 1950s.The episode succeeds despite, or maybe because of, the absence of hostile aliens out to destroy earth, hostage situations, shipmates being transformed into disgusting monsters or any major violence. It's a light-hearted episode that poses a simple premise: prior to first contact a few Vulcans become trapped on earth during a survey mission and face the prospect of not being able to return home. How will they adapt? Do they interact with humans risking discovery? And it's how these questions are answered provide the conflict and make the show compelling.The main character of the story is T'Pol's Great Grandmother, but you relate to the character as being T'Pol herself, which is not unreasonable since T'Pol is telling the story. And since what we're watching is a story, any concerns about believability are irrelevant. We don't know if this is real or fiction.I loved the ending and the way they left Trip and Archer not knowing if the story is true and then that very last scene with T'Pol alone in her room.More episodes like this and less on endless protracted inter-stellar wars and the show would still be on the air.",10

(The episodes from TOS where Kirk went back to the '60's or whatnot, or Carpenter Street, from Season 3 of ENT? Genius.) It was the not-so-original crash-landing-on-a-primitive-planet-and-we-all-have-to-fit-in plot, but it worked out /splendidly/. It also highlighted looking past what you've been told (Mestral's obvious start of some chemistry with that Maggie gal? Sarek x Amanda Grayson, much?) and really having an open mind.A very good second episode for the second season of a great series.

When their rations finish and without means of communication, they move to Carbon Creek to get food, interacting with the inhabitants, finding job in the community and feeling the warm welcome of the gentle dwellers.""Carbon Creek"" is a great episode about the unknown first contact of Vulcans on Earth. The story is ambiguous and it is never clear whether T'Mir and T'Pol are the same character, or T'Mir is really her great-great-grandmother. Trip in some moments is very inconvenient with his observation about T'Pol age, but this query may be a clue that they are the same person. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Carbon Creek""",9
6,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Carbon Creek (TV Episode 2002)",Odd but quite enjoyable,"This episode is very unusual in structure and like none other. It begins with T'Pol, Trip and the Captain sharing some wine and talking. Trip encourages T'Pol to open up and tell them a story. She responds by telling them about her great-great-great grandmother who, according to the story, actually landed on Earth well before Zefram Cochran--even though history books record that he was the first human to come into contact with the Vulcans. It seems that a small Vulcan ship was covertly observing the Earth when it developed engine problems and crashed in Pennsylvania in 1957. What follows is a cute story about three Vulcans trying to blend in--and one which really seemed to take to American culture.This story isn't perfect--the ending is awfully vague and you really have no idea if this really happened or not. But, it was very entertaining and enjoyable--and is well worth seeing.",8

One of them begins to have feelings for a single mother who owns a bar. She has a son who is trying to get to college but has few resources. They are dangerously close to blowing the whole prime directive, especially since one of them has gone rogue. T'Pol is in command because their captain died in the crash.

It isn't there.Biggest annoyance is Tpol (supposed to be her great-grandmother? Might as well be the same character) attempting to display a lack of emotion, yet her indifference to trapped miners is definitely an emotion; indifference, callousness, insensitivity.Emotions aren't just wonderful feelings.If I were a Vulcan, I wouldn't trust either depictions of these Klingon women to bring back any worthwhile information on foreign lifeforms, as the idea 'dont get involved' falls strangely short of studying said lifeforms.Second irritation is Trip's pitiful down-hominess toward's Tpol.""If she's yore granma, how old are you?""

9,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Carbon Creek (TV Episode 2002)",By 2002 they should have known not to mess with canon,I was apprehensive about this episode as the story of three Vulcans crash landing on Earth in the 1950's was too much f*&%^&g with Canon for my liking and pretty much made the epic events of the film 'First Contact' seem obsolete.In actuality the episode is quite enjoyable and it's actually rather cool to see the situations the Vulcans get in but I'm afraid Berman and Braga pushed it too far by suggesting one of them stayed on Earth for the next hundred years amongst the humans.Another slap is that they gave the episode the perfect opportunity to rectify the situation by suggesting T'Pol told a made up story to affectionately fool Archer and Trip but they went and ruined it by showing concrete proof that it did in fact happen.A well made episode it may be but screwing with canon this way is the kind of dangerous and arrogant writing that makes hardcore fans give up and by 2002 they really should have know how rabidly picky Star Trek fans were about their franchise and this was probably the start of the show's gradual drift from popularity.,7
10,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Carbon Creek (TV Episode 2002)",Great... Up to the Last 5 Minutes,"This was on the cusp of turning into my favorite ST:E episode thus far before the ending occurred. The concept of 3 Vulcans trapped on Earth is a cool concept, a bit of a mirror on the classic ""Human Trapped on an Alien Planet"" plot. We get to see it from the opposite perspective. All the acting and set design is pretty cool and it's interesting how the Vulcans acclimate to our society as time passes.Now to the bad stuff: the end. I don't enjoy this piece of revisionist history that occurs in this episode. Leaving a Vulcan behind to live on for another 100 years had me rolling my eyes. This show gave itself an out by positing the possibility that T'Pol made all this up to entertain them. Leaving this up in the air would have been a good finish and would have left the audience wondering. By showing T'Pol with her grandmother's handbag at the end, it throws away any intrigue or opaqueness this episode contained. Now it is established that this story (at least the part about the crash landing and how Vulcans invented Velcro) is true. ST:E really ruined one of it's better episodes with this ending.",6

1,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Minefield (TV Episode 2002)",One of the best of season 2,"This is one of the most well written, well paced and well acted episodes of Enterprise's second season. Unlike the typical episode involving in-house franchise writing, Minefield is story-driven, suspenseful and dramatic. Although it included some of the most annoying and absurd aspects of Enterprise - such as the crew's advanced (pre-Kirk) intelligence concerning cloaking devices - the plot gave the principal cast a rare opportunity to shine. Keating and Bakula do especially well as they work out their personal and professional relationship in the middle of a cloaked Romulan minefield with both of their lives hanging by a thread. Thankfully, the Romulans are not at all rewritten, and are not even seen in person, in this episode. The fact that no Romulan is seen during the episode is important to the fact that Enterprise is supposed to be a prequel for all the other Star Trek series. A lot of story arcs involving the Romulans depend on the relationship between the Romulans and Vulcans being slowly revealed. The Romulans are depicted as belligerent, xenophobic and unreasonable - very consistent with the earlier series.",9

This is the best episode in the second season. Malcom and Archer are the focus of the episode, as they are put into a life-threatening situation in an alien minefield and the rest of the crew risks it all to save them. The special effects were very good, and this episode had all the characteristics that made so many of the other Star Trek series so good - good writing, intelligent back-story and lots of drama. The space sequences were especially convincing.",9

An expedition that originally seems harmless enough quickly sours as the crew finds themselves in the middle of a minefield with a mine attached to the Enterprise hull ready to blow.The premise for the beginning of this episode was pretty neat. I'm always down for a good suspense-filled bomb-defusal; putting one in space just adds another dimension to the plot. As far as dialogue and directing goes, this episode is also pretty solid. A few questions did arise in my mind however as the episode goes along and we find out that this system is Romulan territory.Why does T'Pol not know about the Romulans or their language? Why is this system uncharted on the Vulcan database? At least mark it as ""Do Not Disturb"" or something to that effect so the Enterprise doesn't go bumbling in there. Seems kind of silly. I guess it's privileged information?The one fault of this one (besides the whole Romulan thing) is the ending. The way they get out of this sticky situation is a bit far-fetched. You think Captain Archer could have figured out a better shield to use for this, maybe land a shuttle on the hull-plating and fly away as soon as Reed was freed. I did appreciate getting some actual Reed backstory besides him being a picky eater that doesn't watch sports or have hobbies. In Season 1, he was the least three dimensional character of the main cast so it's nice to see him getting some screen time. All in all, an above average episode with a bad ending, this seems to be the Season 2 theme so far.Side Note: Reed seems like he wants to die a martyr's death. In Season 1's ""Shuttlepod One"", Reed acts similarly when him and Trip are stranded and Reed practically gives up.",7

So it is Archer's turn with Malcolm.Anyone who has watched endless assortments of Star Trek shows has seen episodes where a handful of crew members are given focus like this (a fave of mine from TOS, tho it did fall short, was when Kirk, Uhura and Chekov were abducted for alien wargames), yet Archer and Mal were hardly spell-binding.What seemed to be missing was something of the Enterprise itself tearing up, with Trip declaring they can't stay much longer or the warp thrusters or the anti-matter drive will explode if they continue to linger.With only Malcolm wounded outside the Enterprise and unseen Romulans the threat, the episode wasn't that suspenseful, as have endless ST shows in the past been.This far into Voyager, when I first watched it, I had favorite episodes.Hasn't happened here with Enterprise.",2

If this isn't bad enough, when the lieutenant tries to detach a mine which has attached itself to the ship, it also attached to him! The Captain (inexplicably) goes out himself to try to help--and the two finally get a chance to talk and get to know each other better. But it's not all fun and games, as the mine is still ready to explode AND several Romulan ships have appeared and are ready to blow up these 'spies'.This isn't a bad episode...until the end when the mine explodes.

The addition of this type of genre only helps. It gives the show's regulars a lot more emotional space to act, and brings some believability to the performances. You could see from the whole that this was a professional cast dying for some meaty scripts.Although the story - which seems to have borrowed heavily from another source - is stronger than many in the first two years; other elements lagged. The soundtrack is tame, not highlighting many of the creepy scenes. And the director, Roxanne Dawson, also needed to stretch some of the scenes out to bring some tension - which seemed unreasonably low throughout the episode. As a whole there seems to be a factory quality to many of the stories coming from these first fifty episodes. It was probably why very few of these shows connected.

0,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" A Night in Sickbay (TV Episode 2002)","The good, the bad and the funny.","I confess, I really like this goofy episode. I read over all of the reviews here, and, in many ways, the reviewers managed to point out aspects of this odd little episode that fly in the face of what Trek is all about -- duty, responsibility, open-mindedness to alien civilizations, etc.Obviously, why Archer chooses to bring his dog to the planet is a head scratcher. He explains that even Porthos deserves a little fresh air sometimes, but, given the importance of the visit -- to acquire some much needed hardware for the ship -- it is ill-conceive to risk offending the natives of this planet who we know to be a sensitive lot based on the last time the crew of Enterprise met them.Nevertheless, I think the other reviewers are being a little bit slavish in their commitment to ""Trek-canonical continuity"", or whatever you want to call it, and would be well disposed to suspend their religious-like devotion to the tenets of Starfleet, and enjoy the goofiness of this very good-natured episode.From the suggestion that Archer subconsciously lusts after SubCommander T'Pol -- and his amusing Freudian slips in support thereof -- to the sappy-but-compelling story of a grown man's genuine affection for his quadraped, and, well, the ""heart"" of this episode defeats the logic of it, handily.If you are willing to enjoy it as an intergalactic drawing room comedy, and not an ""affront"" to all that is sacred Trek-wise**, it's an amusing and, at times, touching episode.** As much as I love Trek in all its incarnations, I certainly do not share the absurd conviction of those humourless drones who seem to view the show as sacred text, and Gene Roddenberry as their saint. If every episode involved a serious inquiry into the manifold issues of intergalactic travel, the prime directive, and the philosophical implications of exploring the galaxy...well, then the various series would be crushed under their own self-important weight, and the concepts themselves would implode, pulling the entire series into a dull, lifeless black hole of preachy sanctimony. The series needs -- nay, demands episodes like this one, if for no other reason than to remind the viewers that, particularly in the early years of warp-speed space exploration, mistakes and folly were as much a part of the growth process as revelation and enlightenment.In short to the naysayers: lighten up.

Unlike most episodes of this series, the action focuses on character development. If you were to watch the series episode by episode, this one would likely increase your understanding of Captain Jonathan Archer tenfold, your understanding of Doctor Flox by about double, and would also provide nice insights into the character of T'pol.Archer's achilles heal turns out to be his beagle Porthos. Porthos is sick with a life threatening illness, and Scott Bakula does a great job of acting out a manic, somewhat deranged Captain Archer as he crumbles under the stress of the possible loss of his best friend. For once, we are presented with a Captain Archer who is not guided by his best lights of professionalism. Stress also affects his job performance, as he can not concentrate on an important diplomatic mission, and repeatedly offends those who he is negotiating with.In the end, the story offers a nice take on a Star Trek theme which can be traced back to the first series - how even the most powerful members of a team need every member of that team to get them where they need to go.",6

The unbalanced attitude of Archer, prioritizing his dog over the needs of the Enterprise, is weird and unexplainable, disclosing a total level of lack of professionalism and childish behavior.

It's another example of how the show-runners seem to think that sex jokes will sell--just like that pointless scene in season 1 where they had Hoshi's shirt come off as a ""joke."" I knew going into Enterprise that the show-runners tried to over- sexualize T'pol to boost ratings but i'd hoped since she was done so well in so many episodes that the creepy treatment of her didn't exceed more than a few nudge-nudge comments and her impractical bodysuits. The voyeuristic way this episode is shot, too, makes you just want to cringe watching it.

I don't get to chase bats, take a stroll in the local gym, or dream about sexy aliens. I do have a sick pet to worry about though so that's another realistic touch to this episode.One other interesting element is the music which accompanies this episode.

Porthos the dog evidently tinkled on some sacred tree--though WHY Archer brought his dog on a diplomatic visit makes little sense. Regardless, back on the ship Dr. Phlox detects that Porthos somehow got infected by something on the planet. Most of the episode consists of Archer hanging about sickbay and mostly appearing to be in a very grumpy mood. Archer steadfastly refuses to apologize and the Doc thinks all this anger and grumpiness is because the Captain needs to get laid. Worst of all--the Captain seems to have little regard for his ship, his mission or being a professional. To him, it's all about his dog.This seems like a poorly written episode to me. Archer's behaviors often seemed illogical and mostly he just seemed like a real grouch.

As an animal lover myself, I would have never taken one of my pets into an environment that had proved in the past to be tense.But what made this episode even more ridiculous was the endless problem with all of these ST shows, constantly depicting things that are sacred and insulting to other cultures, as tho they are offering some insight into American religious zealots.The aliens were now offended when the dog urinated on a sacred tree, yet the aliens were quite capable of taking the dog urinating as an insult.Strange how the dog's urinating wasn't regarded as some form of worship. I wonder how that one got by the show's writers.From there, we are subjected to a captain who was misguided by his duties. In watching the episode, I found it very easy to forget that Bakula was supposed to be the ship's captain.He chose to sleep in sickbay and from there we are given more inanities of behavior (sigh) that we aren't supposed to understand and that causes us to furrow brows.The doctor non-chalantly clips long, hairy toenails and feeds them to hungry caged animals. Ewwwwww! Then a white bat creature escapes.Oh, how is anyone supposed to sleep with all of this going on! Toenail clipping, for crying out loud! I was waiting for something that feeds on vomit to be presented.Then we were inexplicably given some idea that the captain was in love with T'pol, and that perhaps he was masking those feelings with his concern over the dog.Endless amounts of rubbish.""your dog is ill, so go have sex. You'll feel better."" And of course, the captain had to apologize and we humans had to regard his apology as completely ridiculous, because we are so (everyone smile very sarcastically) narrow-minded! Saw depictions such as this endlessly droned out on TNG.Oddly enough, the only thing missing from this awful episode was that Trip person offering his smirks and downhome boyisms, tho Bakula seemed to be covering all of that with the silly dog.Oh, the dog survived, so now go play fetch.",2

It seems that Archer brought his dog with him when negotiating, and the dog peed on their trees. Porthoes comes back to the ship with an inflicted immune system and may die. Archer becomes enraged, ignoring the fact that he is putting the whole crew in jeopardy. He and T'Pol are in a very adversarial position. Dr. Phlox is the central figure here and we get to know a lot more about him. We also get to see some outrageous demands made by the Kreetessians.

Do not bring your dog to their home world, especially when you need something important from them!To make matters worse, he puts all the blame on them and is super testy to everyone the entire episode. The reason? Sexual tension with T'Pol. Where did this come from? We've seen no evidence of this ever and it is extremely out of character and unprofessional from Archer's standpoint. He's a very prim and proper captain that would not entertain these emotions with T'Pol. If anything the sexual tension has been between Trip and T'Pol, not Archer.This entire plot and episode are silly and I don't even want to waste anymore time on it.

The characters do nothing surprising - sticking within their predefined limits (and therefore failing to develop) and the story, though entirely coherent, doesn't really grab its audience.Klingons play the role of the heavy in this. The Klingons depicted here are one-dimensional creatures with much less intelligence than those depicted in TOS, TNG and DS9, and are somehow much better understood than they were in the first contact made earlier in the Enterprise series. Another remarkable inconsistency in this episode is the fact that the universal translator appears to be functioning at 100% efficiency and 100% of the time. In fact, it has apparently disappeared - unless the federation has borrowed translator microbes from the crew of Moya on Farscape.A mining colony populated by undefined aliens - with the sort of minor forehead cosmetics that usually indicates that they are very much like us and also the good guys - is being raided by Klingon marauders and can not fight back.

However, they were 100% right about this basically being a rehash of ""The Seven Samurai"" (later, ""The Magnificent Seven"") and shows poor writing. I also think ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" was not a bad series at all--but because there'd already been a HUGE number of Trek shows*, it isn't surprising that there would be a few klunkers because the idea well started drying up.The show is pretty much what you'd expect with such a derivative plot. A mining camp is being attacked and mistreated by some nasty Klingons. In the past, the Klingons even killed a few of these folks just to teach them their place! Archer and company naturally don't like this and stick around to show these folks how to fight for themselves. Unfortunately, the ending makes no sense, as they capture the Klingons and then just let them and their ship go. If there is any consistency at all in the series, Klingons won't just disappear and most likely came back and murdered everyone or simply blew up the camp from space. Duh.By the way, in this and other shows the crew talk about needing Deuterium for its engines. While they make it sound like a mineral, it's actually a liquid--often nicknamed heavy water or heavy hydrogen. And, it's NOT mined but separated from water.*Think about this. The original ""Star Trek"" lasted three seasons. ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" and ""Star Trek: Voyager"" all lasted seven seasons. So, before ""Star Trek: Enterprise"", you've already had about 24 seasons of Trek shows! No wonder the ideas sometimes seemed recycled or borrowed.",3

Archer decides to help the colonist to defend the refinery with tactical training and courage.I liked ""Marauders"" a lot.

Klingons had teleportation on their side, and they are supposed to be ruthless but well trained tacticians in that face to face field battle. Instead wee see klingons behave like mindless barbarians, charging in a group formation against well placed dispersed hidden opponents with the higher ground. Its a no brainer. They could lock on their opponents with the transport and disable them. Or at least pinpoint from space their location (no scanners?). Or at least transport themselves to a better location.

I'll admit I rarely watched Voyager because when your first enemy has interstellar space travel but can't make water? Need I say more. I think ""Marauders"" epitomizes why Enterprise was canceled and I started to tune out. The writers and people in control of the show didn't care. As proof look at Battlestar Galactica it didn't need a couple seasons to find it's legs and it's written from a former Star Trek:TNG writer.

I initially thought the episode might be a good one. The setting is nice and the the acting is passable, the Klingons looks fearsome. However this all quickly falls apart as the plot line gets littered with clichés. The Klingons turn into a bunch of bumbling buffoons who get out-maneuvered by a ragtag group of miners and turn into a mob instead of the tactical warriors they're know for.I have to assume that they return after the Enterprise leaves. It'd be uncharacteristic of them to just drop this battle and walk away with their tails between their legs. This mining camp most likely got massacred, I'm sorry to say. There's no way they could compete with Klingons. Archer has doomed these people via his intervention.Not a very strong episode but not as bad as some of these reviews are making it out to be.

What secrets is she hiding? T'Pol is really one of the only characters from the crew that I'm attached to at this point so anytime we get a T'Pol-centric episode I perk up a little. This episode is actually not too bad. It shows us the struggles that Vulcans can have subduing their emotions in high stress situations. T'Pol is forced to think about her blocked memories and relive the decisions of her past. There are actually some stakes to this episode and it builds trust between the captain and T'Pol.Now, for the bad parts. I couldn't care less about Trip's subplot of his duties as Captain. I know we're suppose to find this amusing but it's really just a boring time-filler and destroys all the impetus being created from the main story line.I also wasn't a huge fan of the ending. I would have like to have seen an ambiguous ending where we are unaware of whether Menos is a good guy or a villain.

Meanwhile, Trip and Travis try to find the means to activate the cloak of a Suliban ship to rescue their friends in the hostile planet.I did not like the predictable ""The Communicator"" episode. The story is silly and the preoccupation of the contamination of a pre-warp culture is not applied when the rescue team fights against the militaries. Further, the capture of Reed with a weapon is worse than lost of a simple communication apparatus. In my point of view, this episode is not well resolved in spite of the explanation of T'Pol in the end. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Comunicador"" (""The Communicator"")",6

Trip attempts to fix the cloaking on the Suliban cell ship in order to save his comrades. (Side note: Not once since that episode have we mentioned that we still have this ship.) His invisible hand gives the episode a little but of humor actually kind of enjoyed it.Overall, the premise that Reed and Archer are willing to sacrifice their lives in the name of non-contamination, even though they've already contaminated it, is ludicrous.Conclusion: Fast-paced and full of action, but with little quality to speak of.",6

It seems that security folks on the planet found the communicator and now they want to cross-examine these two 'spies' that they captured. This involves a bit of torture as well as possible execution.

In flashback, the crew is on its way to get some pictures and do some research on a black hole. Unfortunately, a form is space sickness occurs as the crew begins to obsess on trivial things to a dangerous degree. Reed becomes a militant nut. Tripp needs to fix the Captain's chair, and goes beyond the bounds of a simple task. The Captain is writing a one page preface to a book about his father (which reaches 16 pages).

At first the crew's behavior is hardly odd, a few quirks, a little tightly focused, but gradually they become more and more obsessed by minor matters to the exclusion of all other things. This is particularly creepy as even the Denobian doctor is affected and seems about to go way overboard in his search for the cause of a crewman's headache.The ending is a tense run on a debris strewn course with a groggy captain trying to pilot the ship to safety.Not a stellar episode, but satisfying nevertheless.",7

Folks becomes SO fixated that doing their jobs is impossible. Worst of all is Dr. Phlox who is about to commit horrific acts because of this compulsion.

T'Pol's introduction of the log and our view of the crew passed out around the ship made this even more intriguing.

Why doesn't it have a seat belt or something . . . Trip suggest inertial dampers so that no matter what the ship experiences . . .

One of the reviewers seems to think that every person is supposed to be a type and he apparently has decided that in this case she should be a feminist with an iron will. Fear of technology has nothing to do with a person's character. Hoshi was put into a totally confusing situation and did everything she could to be noticed as she began to fade. She was in a kind of netherworld of her dreams and the realities of her intense situation. If there were such a thing as a transporter, it would be incredibly frightening, even to the strongest member of a crew. As for the conclusion, I believe it was perfectly logical.",8

Here in ""Vanishing Point"", unfortunately, Hoshi is even MORE annoying than usual...if it's possible. The show begins with Hoshi being nervous and worrying about having to use the transporter. When she arrives on the ship, she claims to feel 'odd' and it's only a vague feeling at first. However, as time passes, her whining manages to be more reasonable as she does start to disappear...which, considering what I think of her character, is a very good thing. After a bit, she is surprised to see some other creatures who are out of phase--and they mean to do bad stuff to Enterprise. Sadly, however, the show concludes with her return to normal space and time.

When a storm hits and returning to Enterprise via shuttlepod is no longer feasible, both Trip and Hoshi must take a maiden voyage on the transporter. Upon their return, Hoshi begins to feel unwell.This episode is less about Hoshi's fear of the transporter and more about Hoshi's inner psyche and insecurities. Hoshi, at least up to this point, is the most trepidatious character we have on ST:E. She has voiced her concerns and uneasiness in the past (See Season 1's ""Fight or Flight"") and this is no different. Hoshi's fear of being unheard and unneeded has caused her mind to envision a world in which she's disappeared completely from the Enterprise. She often feels invisible so her mind enacts a scenario where she becomes just that.The ending where the aliens come aboard and secretly plant bombs on the Enterprise is an opportunity for Hoshi to save the day. She conquers her fear of the transporter by using the alien's version of a transporter, risking her livelihood to save those on the Enterprise.The fact that Hoshi's mind requires this self-motivation to boost her confidence shows how far out of her element Hoshi can be at times on the Enterprise. While some reviewers have criticized Hoshi, it is important to remember that not every crewman can have nerves of steel, many must have degrees of self-doubt. While I don't think Hoshi is a great character on this show, she maybe a necessary one to show viewers that not all crewman are action heroes.Conclusion: A fairly pointless and boring episode unless you're a big fan of Hoshi.

However, from the very beginning episode it became clear that the series was simply going to pander to the sexual frustrations/dysfunctions of the more die hard fans by showing a lot of skin and sexual tension (i.e. T'pol and Trip changing in front of each other, Captain Archer in the shower, male and female crew giving each other the up-and-down glances to foreshadow future ""hook ups"" written into the story etc). In this extremely bad episode, Trip is forced to rescue a Paris Hilton styled princess, with an excruciatingly horrible ""performance"" from Padma Lakshmi (she has got to be the worst walk-on actress ever) from some ""bad guys"". Of course there is the same basic sexual tensions, skin (she rips the bottom of her dress off during the escape) and wafer-thin dialogue. Poorly written, acted and cast. Truly the low-point all around.",

Soon enough, aliens from the same species infiltrate the radiation-exposed portions of the ship.Bottom-line: Archer and the crew must figure out a way to regain control of their ship.Essentially, this is a subtle recycle of one of TOS' best episodes and a plot that was used in Voyager at least twice. Could have been much more interesting as a two-part arc. Why the first crew of aliens would be seeking protection from a storm which poses no threat to them is not examined, and it is not explained why Archer remains so trusting after having had problems with virtually every alien species he has encountered thus far (are we supposed to simply believe that the entire federation was completely naive before Kirk and Spock?)",6

It would have been nice if the plot was a more original one but as a stand-alone filler episode, it was one of the better ones.The struggle between Trip and Zho'Kaan is exciting and interesting. The majority of the episode focuses on them and their back and forth interactions of control. The Vulcans' previous hostile interplay with the Arkonians is a nice added wrinkle to the plot to up the stakes a little a bit.

7,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Dawn (TV Episode 2003)","""Enemy Mine"" Regurgitated","This is, as other reviewers have mentioned, another variation of ""Enemy Mine"", a moderately effective classic of SF. The reason for the low rating is not the mildly derivative nature of the episode, but because it displays all the subtle flaws of the first two seasons of all the revival Star Treks, most notably execrable writing and excessive misuse of ""Duh!?!? Why not...?"" dramatic points demonstrating an almost complete lack of really obvious escapes not made to enhance so-called ""drama"", which is why this is *melodrama*, not *drama*.... For this one, we've got several melodramatic macguffins -- things placed there specifically to create drama, which rationally are unlikely. One of them is perhaps vaguely explicable but the others are inexcusable. The first is that the shuttle is out with neither a translator nor, apparently, a hand phaser, which, sorry, ought to be **standard equipment** on ANY shuttle when leaving the confines of the ship -- that this is kind of DUH would be obvious to the Malcolm Reed character even if no one else. After all, it's his job to be slightly paranoid and to expect problems and prepare the ship and its crew to meet them. That's the excusable problem. The inexcusable ones include the lack of proper survival gear as well as the fact that ""we can beam you out, but we can't figure out that we can beam DOWN that survival gear -- including, say, a **environmentally controlled tent** -- which we rather stupidly forgot to include on the shuttle."" Another is the factoid that the alien can't be beamed out. THIS species is too sensitive, apparently. Just a bit conveeeeenyent, if you think about it. So the episode goes on for five more ""dramatic"" minutes while you're busy looking for something to throw at the screen as a proxy for idiotically incompetent writers and directors.The first two seasons of all the Star Treks after the original series really, really blow, big time, with regurgitated, hackneyed, and recycled plots and BAD, uber-melodramatic stories.

This disease is stigmatized since only those who mind-meld can contract it.

They simply find the Earthlings lesser beings, barely capable of taking care of themselves. There is prejudice and there is certainty of one's essential superiority.

Its something inherantly volcan but in ENT it has been used as a form of mind expansion, rape, and the basis of extreme prejudice. it took another 100+ yrs for the mind meld to be accepted practice for volcans. this series does a good job at showing not only how humans grew from volcan contact but how volcans learmed tolerance from humans... something they never expected to do.",8

First, Phlox is reunited with one of his wives--and the wife is VERY friendly towards Trip and seems to want to initiate a booty call with him. Second, T'Pol is apparently struggling from an illness (which was alluded to in an earlier show). But, the VERY prejudiced Vulcans hate anyone with the disease and the prevailing attitude is that the folks deserve the illness and their deaths is NOT such a bad thing (an obvious parallel to AIDS). Can Phlox and Archer somehow get these jerk-faces to somehow provide them with information as to how to cure the illness AND still manage to salvage T'Pol's career?This is a good episode.

Spock was dryly witty, Tuvok prudish and irritable.So leave it to Berman and Braga, the idiots behind much of Voyager, Insurrection, Nemesis, and Generations, to make the Enterprise-era Vulcans into the total OPPOSITE of logical, while still retaining a seeming emotionlessness.This episode does to the Vulcans what Voyager's ""Threshold"" and Enterprise's ""Dear Doctor"" did to evolution, rendering them into pale reflections of their species archetype, all but crossing into bad parody. Here, they are not the wise, intelligent, logical beings with awkward social skills, but intolerant, smug, prejudiced pseudo-""aristocrats"".They've been like that virtually the entire series of Enterprise, but this episode in particular demonstrates the incredible ability of Berman and Braga to destroy all the little things that make Star Trek what it is.T'Pol has a fatal disease she contracted when she was forcibly mind-melded by a pack of emotional Vulcans, and she's told no one because apparently the Vulcans oppress anyone with this disease, and consider ANYONE with the disease to be part of a minority that can initiate mind-melds, or else someone who has been given a mind-meld.Replace ""can initiate mind-meld"" with ""black"" and ""Vulcan"" with ""(human) person"" and you pretty much have the ""Enterprise"" Vulcans in a nutshell.It's utterly astonishing, shocking, and infuriating the way the Vulcans are portrayed as BIGOTS, OUTRIGHT BIGOTS with regards to this minority. It's shocking that Captain Archer, deranged moron, is THE ONLY SANE PERSON IN THE ROOM in a scene where he and T'Pol confront a group of three Vulcans towards the end, and Archer lashes out that for years the Vulcans have said the Humans are too irrational, too narrow-minded, etcetera to be allowed all the technological advances the Vulcans have, and THEY PROVE THEMSELVES TO BE THE HYPOCRITES in their Medieval-esquire approach to T'Pol and her illness; she'd be recalled from her place as Subcommander, and never allowed to be a part of ANY starship crew for the rest of her shortened life.The movie ""Philadelphia"" covered this topic beautifully. This episode handles it ass-backwards, with the enlightened, sophisticated, LOGICAL group of people being the racist, prejudiced bigots. In any other story, this would be a genuine story. But due to the DECADES of established Star Trek canon, it's just bad writing.",1
7,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Stigma (TV Episode 2003)",SOMEONE WENT TOO FAR...,"I don't usually watch ""Enterprise"", but I happened to catch the series one night, and they showed an episode called ""Fusion"", which dealt with a splinter group of Vulcans known as ""V'tosh ka'tur"" (Vulcans without logic""). These are the ones who, while they don't reject the teachings of Surak outright, disagree as to how these teachings should be interpreted. They believe in embracing emotions rather than suppressing them, in trying to find a balance between logic and emotion (sounds very human, doesn't it?)---and one of them, a character named Tolaris who apparently had an ulterior motive, persuaded the very logical and dispassionate T'Pol to join him in a mind-meld. But he went too far, and when she resisted and pushed him away he lost his cool, I mean really flew off the handle, and he assaulted her with the result that she ended up in sickbay, in bad shape. She finally recovered, but as a consequence she developed Pa'nar syndrome. It took T'Pau---a familiar figure in Star Trek's ""Amok Time"" and an expert melder---to remedy the situation and get T'Pol back to normal. Now, it seems that in ""Stigma"" she did not want to talk about her ordeal. I can understand how she must have felt at being thus violated, and how relieved she had been when those V'tosh ka'tur finally left the Enterprise---no doubt she never wanted to see the likes of them again.",9
8,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Stigma (TV Episode 2003)","Clumsy at times, but still enjoyable","So this is it: Star Trek's gay-episode. While I'm not a huge Trek-nerd, I've come to appreciate the franchise (minus most of the TNG-films) over the past few years. I'm also aware that they always wanted to do a ""gay"" episode but ""never got around to it"" until Enterprise. That in itself is fine by me, since making comments on current issues in a sci-fi-setting is one thing Trek has been known to do since TOS. However: Making a statement about gay people/AIDS in 2003 is hardly what I'd call ""being topical"". It would've been a lot more appropriate or even daring in the 80s or 90s. Still: I didn't mind the subject matter. What I did mind were some minor points with the plot.Phlox setting the plot in motion almost makes him look stupid. Using the age-old ""a *friend* of mine (who is totally not me) has this problem"" request is bad enough. But he also doesn't address the fact that he's asking for data on a Vulcan disease while he has a Vulcan science officer on his ship. He should've just told the doctors beforehand ""I have discussed this with T'Pol but her medical expertise is extremely limited ... that's why I'm asking you guys for help."". Also: His decision to not inform Archer before making his request is also kinda odd. Yes, there's doctor/patient confidentiality, but he should know by now that he can trust Archer *and* that this guy has a right to know about T'Pol's condition. Seems odd to me that he didn't try harder to convince T'Pol that Archer knowing would be in her best interest. Anyhow: The whole analogy of ""Stigma"" couldn't be more obvious if the writers had called the disease ""T'aids"". Still: They make some valid points. The tone of the episode can be rather preachy at times, but when you're dealing with the discrimination of minorities and stigmatized diseases, it's kinda hard to not get preachy. Plus: The B-story of Phlox' horny wife trying to access Trip's matter-injector works pretty well as counter-balance.Now, since a lot of people seem to hate ENT's Vulcans, and this is a very Vulcan-centric episode, here are my thoughts on them: I don't mind the Vulcans being different from the ones in earlier ST-series. I think it's actually pretty cool that the creators of ENT decided to make the Vulcans intolerant and somewhat hypocritical pricks. After all: This is 100 years prior to Spock et all, so why *shouldn't* those earlier Vulcans be different? It gives them a pretty cool arc, albeit a retrofitted one. It would've been a lot more boring to have them behave exactly like Spock and it would've made the Vulcans less versatile as characters. In fact: The characters themselves would've been a lot more boring. How interesting can you make people who'll always do what's logical, don't lie and never seem to have any egotistical motivations?Vulcan behavior in this episode is a lot more varied than what we're used to seeing from the older shows: You have the intolerant doctors, the one doctor who secretly isn't so intolerant (and whose behavior foreshadows what the Vulcans of TOS will be like) and, of course T'Pol. Her decision to do what she thinks is right, even if it means losing her job, not only makes for the drama in the story, but advances the character and gains her respect from both the audience and her colleagues. I also enjoyed watching Archer standing up for T'Pol - probably marking his final acceptance of her as both his first officer and a person. Also good: Trip's uneasiness and Phlox' ""tolerance"" regarding Mrs. Phlox' not-so-subtle advances provided some much needed levity. Overall, Stigma is a pretty solid effort in my book.7/10",7

However, the Andorian leader, Shran, has asked that Captain Archer come to the planet with the annoying Vulcan, Soval, so that they can negotiate a peaceful settlement. While this idea is laudable, Shran doesn't realize that many of his troops don't want peace and will do anything to guarantee war! So, as Archer, Soval and T'Pol near the planet, a nasty surprise is waiting for them.This is a neat episode as it brings back the loathsome Soval and softens him a bit. Likewise, the show has seen Shran evolve from an angry jerk to a reasonable friend.

The feud between the two is one of the more interesting parts of ST:E.This episode has everything you could want from a Star Trek episode: planetary feuds, science jargon, and a little bit of action. It also does a great job of furthering the plot regarding the relationship between the Vulcans, Andorians, and humans.

The Tholians' interest in the unidentified space craft adds a new subplot to follow in the upcoming Temporal Cold War. They appear to be extremely hostile and even more powerful than the Sulibans, not to mention their voices are disconcerting. What is their involvement in all of this?This episode did a good job of furthering this season's over-arching plot but also gave us many new questions to consider: Who are these Tholians?

That being said... I didn't mind it too much. The episode goes along at a good clip and (mostly) has a good batch of new alien races to explore. There's a certain tenseness to this episode because of the close quarters of the ship. We get to learn a bit about the Enolians and the out of control smuggling occurring in their system. If there's one theme to learn from this episode, it's probably the issue of false imprisonment on crimes not committed. I like that we spend the majority of our time on the prison ship and don't cut back to Enterprise too much. My main issue with this episode is the extremely annoying character of Zoumas. He's unnecessary, unwanted, and unfunny. He added nothing to the plot and was really did nothing but eat up screen time as we approached the episodes climax. This would have been a lot better without his inclusion.Besides this though, an average episode with some good action, more action than you see in most ST:E episodes.Side Note: After Trip knocked out the Nausicaan prisoner with a wrench but was then recaptured after the failed coup, it seems likely (knowing Nausicaan behavior) that he would have taken his wrath out on Trip and at least beaten him unconscious or injured him in some way.

While they are possessed, they dream vividly about their homes and other fantasies, leading members of the Enterprise crew to wonder what these creatures really want.

2,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" The Crossing (TV Episode 2003)","Predictable episode, boring conclusion","As the other reviewers said, it was a predictable episode. It's not unlike the episode of TNG where Troi, Data and O'Brien are possessed by ghostlike beings trapped on a planet. Here it's ghosts in a ship trying to take over all the bodies on Enterprise.The first plot hole is when they decide they can defeat the non- corporeal beings by killing the host body. T'Pol says it will be like they are in space, they will die. We have already seen the beings travel through space from their ship to Enterprise and it doesn't kill them, so the explanation doesn't make sense. Secondly, the crew members in the catwalk are shielded from possession but Trip is possessed anyway. Did the beings find a way through? Or was he simply still possessed from earlier in the episode and had been pretending to be okay for the middle of the episode? Never explained.Third, when the beings take over the crew members, we see the crew members' ""soul"" or whatever leave the body and take flight, becoming non-corporeal as well. So if Archer's final plan involves killing the host body and driving out the evil beings, how can he be sure that the crew members' soul will come back to its body once the body is revived? How can he be sure that the evil being won't hang around and come back to the body once it's revived? Especially since the being inside Trip knew what the plan was; kill the host, drive out the possessing spirit, then revive the body for the crew member to return. What's to keep the evil spirit from returning first?The ending was all very rushed. I also wondered why Phlox was acting so strange towards the end of the episode. Counting out loud as if he's never read English before, asking how to open a hatch and how to turn a handle and what to with the hatch once it's released, to which Archer says ""I don't know, set it on the ground or something."" Phlox seems to lack basic life skills which is exactly how the aliens act. Were we supposed to suspect he might be possessed? Not answered.",4
3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" The Crossing (TV Episode 2003)",Wrong story path,"I was excited at first when they met these new aliens. I did not like the way the story unfolded. I think it would have been much better if they were not a hostile species. The story should have allowed the crossing of all members into various forms so they could indeed experience what it was like to be female if they were male and vice versa. Plus being able to see what it was like to be Vulcan/human and alien. They missed an awesome opportunity. Had they written it so that everyone could have gone through that experience, I believe it would have made all the crew members a great deal closer to one another. The aliens needed their vessel to be repaired. They should have written it so that Enterprise helped the aliens make the repairs. They would have made friends with a very unique species. The writers screwed up in my opinion.",4

But then the plot of most dramatic stories involves an adversary. The creatures that inhabit the ship at first seem to be friendly, giving people euphoria, living in a sentimental realm. As time goes by, however, they begin to want the crew. It's the typical Star Trek plot where someone has to gain a sense of sanity for a while and take charge.

The confusing danger feeling was a nice touch.Enterprise comes along a flying haunted house filled with ghosts. To this episode the crew of Enterprise seemed to never even heard of ghosts (or any other paranormal activity) and ghost abilities like possession and walking through walls, even though they talked about it more than once before. But it turned out the haunted house was degrading, and the ghost would not survive in open space for long. So the obvious ""take over ship and/or crew"" happened again. You'd think the ship would have been upgraded from that by now.Archer was proud, arrogant, narrow minded and paranoid, and tends to demonstrate loathing to all unnatural intelligence. Instead of exploring the immense possibilities of an alliance, he went on about ""the mind is personal space"", and in the end blew up the flying haunted house with two torpedoes. The problem with exorcism, instead of fixing/extending the flying ghost house or aiding to a nearby ghost habitable planet, is that same fear new science fought for millennia.In the end it was obvious that nothing was to come of this, because nothing of the sort corresponds with the rest of Star Trek. Just think of the tech potential: study of nonphysical existence, better understanding of subspace, faster flight with no warp signature, enemy ship paralysis, REINCARNATION. What is the point of exploration, if there is nothing to be gained from it?!.Would the haunted house last a flight back to Earth or its colony where this could have been explored more, we will never know.",3

Archer was close minded, arrogant and simply stupid at times. So wore the writers as it doesn't make any sense that these non-corporeal been didn't take over the captain first. Anyway at the end Archer didn't care to communicate or negotiate with these creatures. He hide like a rat and instead of proposing to those beings to work together and share their knowledge and fix their ship (a humongous ship who can fly way faster than Enterprise) he decide just to run fast and destroy them all (the last of their kind in the universe).

But when these beings begin to possess the bodies of the crew, Archer decides these space ghosts might have ulterior motives.This episode is riddled with plot holes (summed up nicely by other reviews, so I won't get into it). The premise itself, while not the most original, held my attention for the majority of the episode but it all unraveled at the end. It felt as if they cut out some of the climax because it all seemed very rushed to me. The tension that had been building all episode lost all its momentum due to the truncated conclusion.We didn't even have time for a typical post-climax where we explain away the plot holes: Why did Trip get possessed in the catwalk? Again, it was all cut off prematurely.The writers need to make up their mind about Captain Archer and his relationship with unknown alien lifeforms. I was shocked when he decided to destroy this ghost ship at the end and leave these things to die. I figured he would feel pity on them since their ship was being destroyed (no explanation on why it was, by the way) and try to help them fix it or find permanent bodies for them to relocate to. It was all very oddly handled.Up until halfway through this episode, I thought the whole thing might be an allegory on the Red Scare and how we can't be paranoid about people different than us and lock them up. Instead, Archer ends up killing these people.You could argue that these people aren't even nefarious but just desperate, knowing that they will soon die if they don't do something. Archer helps speed the process along a little bit.Conclusion: A solid first half but the conclusion feels rushed and clichéd. Definitely skippable in the grand scheme of things.",4

They just wanted to survive. this could have been done by the crew helping them fix the failing alien ship from crew members willing to help while the entities had control of their bodies and abilities.the writers could have taken the opportunity to allow the crew to experience the lives of subspace beings in a way that they would never find again. instead, the normally trusting archer was not himself. tpal was also not her normal self... almost like they switched personalities just for this episode.the writers started out having them be sentient subspace beings but they turned out to essentially be ghosts. either way, how could they travel through space to get to the enterprise once its released but then wont survive in space. if they are subspace beings, why couldnt they just go back into subspace. was the ship the one thing that allowed them to travel into ENTs space? things just didnt match up and the writers couldnt decide which they wanted.all in all, just an ok ep. i really expected a different ending. i sure didnt expect archer to blow the ship up and kill every living entity on board. what if they were they only beings of their kind. archer had no way of knowing and instead of finding a way to help them, he killed an entire race.",5

However, inexplicably, Archer just somehow knows that these beings are bad--something that NOTHING in the show so far supports. This is a huge weakness of the show. Fortunately, what follows is pretty exciting and the show quite memorable. Not a great episode due to how Archer is written in this one but it is a novel sort of episode in many ways.

It's an obvious set-up, though I must say that Archer did apparently put himself in this situation by being the intergalactic nice guy and helping the wrong people.

I can honestly see no strong flaws, save that it grows tiresome and predictable the more you watch it. Actually there is one negitive: when Archer tells his side of the story. He should know klingons better than to tell it like that, or taken that long.

Sadly, however, his father recently died and difficulties with him and his family adjusting to this and his being in Starfleet make up the episode. The biggest of these adjustments is Mayweather's younger brother taking command of the freighter. Can the family work out their issues?The best thing about this show, by far, is a casual reference to the original ""Star Trek"" episode ""A Piece of the Action"". On the bookshelf in Mayweather's room is a white book entitled ""Chicago Gangs of the Twentieth Century""--and it's the same book and same ship (the Horizon) that led to a planet being contaminated and becoming a planet that emulated the gangsters!! A clever reference an an otherwise enjoyable show.",7

With the recent passing of his father, Travis' brother Paul is struggling with his new Captain's duties. Meanwhile the Enterprise goes to check out some volcanoes explode and Travis and Archer convince T'Pol to watch Frankenstein.Okay, the plot involving Travis and the tense relationship he has with his brother over ""abandoning"" his family makes for good drama and are the best scenes of the episode. Besides these, this episode is a complete bore.The subplot involving T'Pol and Frankenstein is pointless and dull. Who could care about this? Also why do all these crew members love these old movies? Don't get me wrong, I love the classics like Frankenstein but the majority of people today won't watch them, citing them as ""too old"". Do you think they will become more popular a few centuries from now? I highly doubt it. I don't understand these screenwriters fascination with old movies.Thankfully, the scenes on the Horizon salvage this episode to a degree. The two brothers have good chemistry as actors and made this watchable.Conclusion: An okay plot with a terrible subplot that goes nowhere. Skippable.",4
6,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Horizon (TV Episode 2003)",Not important so give it a 'Miss',"No Spoilers. Probably best to just skip this episode as it adds nearly nothing to the overall plot or development of characters. The basic plot sees Travis Mayweather spending several days visiting the freighter he grew up on and encountering various levels of discontent with his having left for Starfleet. We also see T'pol complaining extra hard for most of the episode about being coerced into fraternizing with the crew for 'Movie Night'.The main flaws are that the episode is corny, poorly acted, badly written and under-dramatic. What could have been a powerful homecoming with a complex emotional landscape falls flat, at best, and is cringe-worthy at worst. The freighter, Horizon, is populated by less-than-believable family members who treat Travis with a coolness that conveys less that they are shunning him and more that they have simply never seen him before and are forced at gunpoint to pretend they have. The acting is terrible on every level with only Billingsley and Trineer coming out unscathed.Much of the dramatic plot movements happen off-screen which is bad enough but, worse so does the emotional reaction. When we do see an emotional scene it feels forced and stilted with little warmth or realism. The episode is much like a high school play written by an eighth grader. It references the human condition without having long personal experience with it, leaving the viewer bored and incensed with the waste of their time.",3

Meanwhile, the Enterprise helps a ship with a breach in her reactor, and Dr. Phlox faces an ethical dilemma when an Antaran patient, a race enemy of the Denobulan, does not accept his treatment.""The Breach"" is an episode divided in drama of intolerance, ethics and action. Dr. Phlox faces the order of Captain Archer, based on the human Aristotelian ethics code, and his beliefs on the Denobulan ethics code, based on the will of the patient. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Ruptura"" (""The Breach"")",8
1,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" The Breach (TV Episode 2003)",The Antaran plot is the best part of this show.,"Planet Xantoras is undergoing yet another regime change--and a violent one as usual.

However, when the mission begins, they also discover folks who are the dreaded enemies of the Denobulans and there is a bit crisis because an injured Antaran refuses to let Dr. Phlox help heal him because he is a Denobulan.This is a decent episode. The problems between the Doctor and the Antaran are quite interesting--sort of like between Jews and Germans or Japanese and Chinese folks. But the other plot about the three scientists is actually pretty dull. Overall, watchable but not great.",7

Meanwhile a ship leaving the planet is damaged and contains injured men. Dr. Phlox is faced with the atrocities of his people's past when its discovered one of the injured is a member of the race victimized by Denobulan genocide.I was a little surprised to see that the rating of this episode was a bit low, I thought this episode was particularly good. We get to learn more about the Denobulan's history, Dr. Phlox's personal life, and its all done very dramatically with good acting. John Billingsley is a fantastic actor and has quickly become one of my favorite crew members on ST:E. His rapport with the Henry Stram in this episode is great.The other plot involving the extraction of the Denobulans was less interesting to watch but was a bit more action-packed. Travis breaking his leg again was a nice touch but the bickering between Trip and the scientists was a bit much. Also, Captain Archer told them to turn around at the midway point of the deadline if they couldn't find the scientists. Wouldn't it take longer to climb back out than rappel down? Conclusion: A good episode that gives us a better idea of Denobulan culture.",8

0,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Cogenitor (TV Episode 2003)",Archer is sanctimonious,"It took me awhile, but I finally warmed up to Enterprise. My least favorite character was Capt. Archer. He struck me as exceedingly arrogant and narcissistic. This episode epitomizes that perception. At the end of the episode when Captain Archer is berating Commander Tucker, Tucker tells the Capt that he was just doing what the Captain would have done, and that is absolutely true. The Captain replies ""If that's true, then I've done a pretty lousy job setting an example around here"", also absolutely true.Let's recount some examples of Archer's escapades:Archer get's involved in ""championing"" the rights of the downtrodden in ""Detained"" (Season 1 Episode 20). He decides he ""must"" free the captive Suliban, even though he and Mayweather were going to be released.Season 1 Episode 6, The Andorian Incident, he decides to go against the wishes of the Vulcans at the P'Jem sanctuary. Why? It is their facility; they have been through raids by the Andorians before; the Vulcans want to let the Andorians look until they're satisfied and leave. Archer won't respect the wishes of the Vulcans and his interference results in the destruction of the sanctuary.Season 1 Episode 16, Fusion, Archer ""orders""/strongly ""suggests"" T'Pol to spend time with the visiting Vulcans, even though she is clearly uneasy at the thought. The result, she is assaulted by one of the Vulcans and develops Pinar Syndrome.Season 1, Episode 17, Rogue Planet, Archer interferes on behalf of the downtrodden creatures that are being hunted. He interferes in the culture, on a ""first contact"" mission, by providing a masking agent so the creatures can evade the hunters.Season 2, Episode 6, Marauders, Archer interferes on behalf of the downtrodden because he's never liked ""bullies"".Season 2, Episode 21, Breach, Archer orders Doctor Phlox to perform medical treatment on a patient, against the patient's wishes. He says ""On Earth, we don't let people die when we could save them."" Really? I thought, even on Earth, a doctor must receive patient consent.I'm not saying I agree or disagree with the actions taken by Archer or Tucker, just that, throughout this series, Archer will take certain actions, the consequences be damned, but chastise others for doing the same type thing. Like I said, overall I like the series, but I never learned to like Captain Archer.",3
1,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Cogenitor (TV Episode 2003)",This Star Trek series has some serious moral issues,"Wow. Just, wow. The Enterprise encounters a new species, the Vissians, who have 3 sexes - male, female, cogenitor. Cogenitors are needed for procreation, but nothing else. They consist of only 3% of the population, so they are passed around from couple to couple as needed. They are not educated, they have no names, and to call them third class citizens would be overly generous.Trip becomes fascinated with the cogenitor on board the Vissian ship, and discovers that it is every bit as intelligent as the male and female members of the species. He secretly interacts with the cogenitor, teaches it (later referred to as she, as she appears rather feminine) to read, shows her a movie, and generally shows her what it's like to be treated as a person, not just a fertility aid. When the Vissians are ready to go on their way, the cogenitor request asylum from the humans, understandably reluctant to return to her restricted life with no rights. Archer denies her request, and berates Trip for ""interfering"" with another culture. Archer is indignant when Trip says he was just doing as Archer would have done (which is very true). And when the cogenitor commits suicide, Archer blames Trip for interfering in the first place, rather than Archer's own decision to force her to return to her life of slavery. So in ""Doctor, Doctor"" we have Archer and Co. willing to allow an entire species to become extinct rather than providing them with a cure for a disease which is wiping out the entire population, because their continued existence might interfere with the evolution of a second species which lives on the same planet. But apparently repressing a race (or one sex of a race) that is already at a high level of evolution is OK. Yay for genocide, yay for sexual slavery - at least for the Enterprise. I find the entire premise implausible. The Vissians are way ahead of the humans on an evolutionary scale. Trip's cogenitor friend learned to read and made huge emotional/social changes within a day. I find it unlikely that people (of whatever species)with so much potential living within an advanced culture would not have picked up a certain amount of knowledge, and developed socially in spite of the restrictions within the culture. And if a day or two of being treated decently would lead to an individual preferring suicide to returning to her previous restricted life, it is highly unlikely that as a group the cogenitors would have accepted their slave status for so long. But my biggest issue is with the idea that ""it's their culture"" is treated as an excuse for any kind of atrocity (except when Archer makes a personal connection with the victims). The Enterprise is roaming the galaxy, but historically Star Trek has always been allegorical. The humans meet new species during their travels, and the issues that develop are usually problems common to humanity in all its social and cultural variations here on Earth. There are certain things that present day humans are willing to accept as ""that's their culture"", but there are also things that are considered utterly unacceptable; although of course there are limits to how far nations are willing to go to address ""unacceptable"" events in other nations.Going to war with the Vissians to ""liberate"" the cogenitors would have been excessive, but granting asylum to the cogenitor from the Vissian vessel would have absolutely been appropriate, and the ""right"" thing to do morally. Not to mention far more consistent with Archer's character.",1
2,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Cogenitor (TV Episode 2003)",A highly intriguing episode ... but ruined by the end sequence!,"I feel compelled to write a review for this one because the end really irritated me! Essentially speaking, Captain Archer was the direct contributor to the death of the titled character. He then goes into a rant with Trip suggesting that it was in fact Trip's fault!! Trip then puts his tail between his legs and acts as if it really was his fault and that he should not have ""interfered""...All the way through the episode we see a very pertinent side of Trip's character. It can be seen that he sees value in people and believes in peoples rights. He works hard at helping a very vulnerable but potentially very interesting character. To see him tuck his tail between his legs at the end like that makes for a very poor chain of events. I have given this a fairly high score but that is purely because it was mostly well done. It was the end that ruined it severely for me. Maybe it is because there is an element of reality about the situation that I became so irritated. It does however soil my (already shaky) opinion of Captain Archer. I would have liked to have seen Trip show more spirit though... it would have been more consistent. After this episode I really do see Captain Archer as a very nasty piece of work.",7
3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Cogenitor (TV Episode 2003)",An Episode that Talks Down to the Fans,"I think Enterprise had a lot of potential. I have been told that the episodes after this one were good. But this is the episode that caused me to stop watching the series. With Cogenitor, Enterprise became uncomfortably preachy. Yes, I know ST has always been preachy but in the past they made it work.As a female fan I was disgusted by an episode that I took to be a thinly veiled commentary on how we shouldn't expect foreign cultures to allow women to have full rights. If the Captain felt that the Cogenitor should be denied basic human rights then that is fine but to see the second officer, who had fought for the Cogenitor and watched the Captain pretty much cause her suicide, agree with him and act like a bad puppy at the end of the episode was insulting. It seemed false and badly written",1
4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Cogenitor (TV Episode 2003)",Intensely Dramatic - Possibly the best of Season 2,"LeVar Burton's directing and J. P Farrell's writing help to give this excellent example of Enterprise an edge which was lacking in most of the series' episodes. The Enterprise is involved in a first contact with some kindred spirits - explorers whose technology is about a thousand years ahead of Star Fleet's. Everything is going along fine as earth culture and Vissian culture begin to interact. The Vissian's share technology and more with the Enterprise crew.This episode's theme is, once again, the prime directive. Since Star Fleet's prime directive did not exist in Archer and company's time, we are seeing one of what must have been dozens of first contact incidents which went wrong. I was only a little annoyed by the Vissians' willingness to share their advanced warp drive technology but rather strident insistence that earthlings not be permitted to interfere with their culture.Eventually, it is revealed that the Vissians have three sexes - male female and cogenitor. All three are required for sexual reproduction, and the cogenitor sex is very rare and - therefore somewhat oppressed, valuable and treated as a commodity. Unfortunately, the writers use the word ""gender"" to describe this, as opposed to sex. Since gender is a social construct and social/sexual identity, connected to, but not defined by sexual reproductive organs, this is a systematic error.Trip befriends the cogenitor and decides to clandestinely educate it in order to help it liberate itself from its bondage. This backfires when the cogenitor asks for asylum on the Enterprise. To this point, only the directing and the originality of the alien species set this episode apart from the typical Enterprise episode, however, the drama steadily mounts toward the end as the series does something with this conclusion which it had never attempted before.",9
5,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Cogenitor (TV Episode 2003)",Dead poets society where Robin Williams kills Neil,"In a total role-reversal, Archer prioritizes gallivanting around a big glowy space ball with his long lost father figure who teaches him to drive his sick space ship over the rights of the disenfranchised. Though the writers try to make Archer look like a man who is torn between two tough decisions with equally reprehensible outcomes, Archer just comes off as a bad guy. Not only was Archer poorly written as a bad guy trying to come off as a man tortured by the moral decisions he must struggle with, the writers copped out on this one and decided to go ahead and write ANOTHER story about star trek life before the prime directiveLike Robin Williams introduced repressed teenagers to literature is ""Dead Poet's Society"", Trip teaches a non-binary alien baby factory to read. Unfortunately, the creatures that inseminated their baby batter into this poor creature think reading is uncouth for a young sex slave and disapprove. The congenitor asks for asylum but Captain Archer declines. Later, they receive word that the congenitor killed itself.Now does archer comfort Trip? Does he say ""Trip you did what you thought was best?"" No. He flat out says that it is Trips fault that the congenitor is dead. This is as good as ending ""Dead Poet Society"" with each student standing on their desk and saying ""Thanks a lot Mr. Keating you killed Neil you jerk"".What are the moral arguments to be made here? Star Trek is really just thinly veiled criticism of today's society through the lens of ""What will our trivial and petty squabbles look like 1000 years from now?"" Are we to say ""Oh we can sit here in our armchairs in the west and criticize Nigeria for the forceful removal of women's clitoris', but just don't understand their culture"". Is this multicultural propaganda supposed to say ""We don't know the harm we can cause in middle east countries by preventing them from stoning women to death when they drive cars, so we ought to just watch from the sidelines""? It's crap; there's no universe in which we're supposed to accept that other cultures aren't better or worse than ours because they allows 50 year old men to marry and rape several 8 year old wives; they're just DIFFERENT.Also what happened with Malcolm and the nymph?

Trip is intrigued about the third gender of the Vissians, necessary for their reproductive process, and Dr. Phlox explains that there are many races with more than two genders and T'Pol asks him to not interfere with the Vissian culture. When Trip finds that the Cogenitor, who does not have a name, is illiterate and treated like and object, has the same level of intelligence of the males and females of its race, he decides to secretly encourage it to learn how to read and expand its culture, tragically affecting the relationship between humans and Vissians.""Cogenitor"" is original, dramatic and tragic, and certainly the best episode of the Second Season up to now. The story is important to show that there are different cultures where the concepts of what seems to be right or wrong are different from the standards of others and must be respected, no matter in deep space or on Earth. In Brazil we have a saying that could be translated as follows: ""the hell is full of people with good intentions"".

7,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Cogenitor (TV Episode 2003)",Boy! People Are Really Emotional About This,"I thought this was quite a provocative episode. Archer is being seen by some as lacking in concern for human rights and almost Hitler like. Unfortunately, he is between a rock and a hard place here. He is thrilled that a friendly species has hooked up with Enterprise and is interested in sharing what they have. The problem is that while he is having a great time, Trip is back at the ship, trying to teach a creature whose sole purpose in life is to aid in reproduction. When he realizes that she/he/it has potential to be more than a facilitator of producing children, he disobeys his captain. The problem is that many see Archer as a sellout because he has been rebellious in the past. I think the problem here is the speed with which everything happens. No study of the culture. No more deliberation before entering on disruption. Archer is on a short leash. One thing no one mentions is that without the cogenitor, this race dies. Another question is, give a little negotiating time, perhaps there could be a cogenitor that has other possibilities other than the primary role. Just food for thought.",8
8,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Cogenitor (TV Episode 2003)",The contest for worst Trek episode of all-time has a new front-runner,"Captain Archer decides to be someone else for this episode, where joyriding with a high technology pal comes before protecting someone from enslavement, someone who requested asylum.Archer completely lost whatever moral credibility the series tried to build up in this episode, one that utterly refused to even mention slavery which is exactly what it was about. The implied misogyny (women don't need equal rights) and heterosexism (gay people are just a small percentage of the population so they don't need equal rights either) are just added bonuses.I never thought I'd see the day when Star Trek demanded that viewers think slavery is OK, using ""different culture in deep space"" as an excuse!I am forcing myself to watch this series, but I am not enjoying seeing what little is left of Trek. The one very good episode so far was the one with the Vulcan diplomat who was rescued after being falsely implicated. It's a shame the series couldn't manage to make more decent episodes like that one. (It was rather contrived in some aspects, such as the inclusion of the mandatory battling, but the character of the Vulcan ambassador and the obvious talent of the actress made it a welcome change from the usual highly mundane and sometimes egregious Enterprise fare.)This also isn't the first time the series has completely botched its take on morality (e.g. Fortunate Son).Watching T'Pau and Archer in this episode, their callous self-serving attitudes made me wonder if the writing staff was replaced by people who knew nothing about them. I can't imagine why the actors agreed to say those lines.The only highlight of this one, in terms of series continuity, is just how human and moral Tucker showed himself to be, even though he completely failed to defend himself, and more importantly — humanity, justice, and liberty, at the end — acting as if he actually was the one who was limited in terms of mental capacity. Also, the episode had promise. There was ample opportunity for making the cogenitor quandary fertile fare. Instead, the writers botched it, and greatly disrespected the foundational morality of Trek. I guess Archer didn't want to come to the aid of someone without there being the promise of yet another firefight or various tepidly predictable beatings, and certainly not a ""transgendered"" person!Next Generation's The Outcast did a far better job at dealing with gender issues and freedom. It was clear enough at the end that the ""psychotectic treatments"" changed Soren into a totally different person (brainwashing) — not the outcome that an enlightened audience would approve of as murdering someone is not typically considered a credible solution for dealing with diversity.* Voyager failed tremendously in exactly that manner, though, with Tuvix, one of the darkest, most embarrassing moments in all of Trek.This episode is possibly even worse than Tuvix, though. With Tuvix, the argument could be made that two lives outweigh one life, corrupt as that argument is as it requires murdering someone which is NOT acceptable. (Soren's murder was also accompanied by the creation of a new person in her body, which is still more positive than a greater loss.) Tuvix was also a one-off, the result of an infinitesimally rare occurrence. In contrast, the cogenitor was part of 3% of a large population and, unlike Archer's ridiculous attempt at logic (the baby that has been yet to be conceived and the misplacing of blame for the suicide), no one's life was at risk. Enslaving the cogenitor and all of its type, even denying them names and the most basic liberties such as the ability to read and make decisions, was shone to be an utterly arbitrary (and therefore unnecessary) thing — a fetish like foot binding. The ""you don't understand the culture"" excuse had nothing at all substantive attached to it; it was the mewling of privileged people trying to mindlessly protect their privilege, nothing more. Unlike the situation with Tuvix, no one's life was going to be restored by maintaining the enslavement. Inconveniencing a couple that wants to breed is not a justification for enslavement just as, more generally, inconveniencing privileged people is no justification for slavery.*That was the same issue that Angel One dealt with. Both The Outcast and Angel One have definite drawbacks as episodes, but neither of them sided with the inhumane appalling notion that alien cultures are exempt from our moral judgment — that it's OK to massacre minorities to maintain ""social harmony"". Humans don't cease to be human simply because they've come into contact with other species. Killing and/or enslaving people to quash diversity is not acceptable in an enlightened culture. Archer himself chided Vulcans for bigotry in a prior episode (although too ineffectually, which is typical for Enterprise writing), when they irrationally withheld medical knowledge due to their distaste for a minority. Again, it seems the writers completely forgot about who T'Pau and Archer are with this episode, or new writers were brought in who didn't bother watching the prior episodes from the very same season. What were the people making this series thinking when they made this episode? Were they thinking at all?",1
9,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Cogenitor (TV Episode 2003)",The unfathomable depths of immorality,"****Spoiler alert***** Just when a few decent episodes in season 2 were finally starting to give me some hope for this series (e3(!),7,9,10 & 15), this dreadful episode drags the entire series back into the unfathomable depths of immorality (E13 in season 1 did the same thing).None of the characters behave according to their ranking or expected personalities : 1)Trip : He should be drooling all over the advanced technologies displayed by the Vissians, instead he is fascinated to hear about their 3 genders and inexplicably decides to investigate this instead. How can this make sense? He is a senior officer on an interstellar starship whose prime mission to get in contact with new life forms, surely he must have been trained on what to expect from the aliens they will encounter prior to the departure. As Dr Flox and T'Pau inform us, this gender pattern is not uncommon so seeing him perplexed about it is unexpected. Then, he forcefully engages with the Cogenitor using unprofessional behavior traits such as deceit and lies with no thought on the consequences whatsoever (however noble his actions are). Actually this is more in line with Captain Archer's personality than Trip's. 2)Captain Archer : he displays the shallowest of personalities of a StarFleet officer ever portrayed on a ST series. First of all he rejects the asylum request from the Cogenitor on the simple basis that this might lead to problems with the Vissians (a highly intelligent and diplomatic species). Heck, what's the point of values and morality when we're making new friends? Especially if more advanced technology can be shared... Then he sermons Trip that he would have never acted against the Vissian's lifestyle contradicting many episodes where he himself displayed a complete disregard for Alien cultures and ethics in order to pursue his own morality (see Cdoctors review). Finally he puts all the responsibility of the Cogenitor's suicide on Trip! Wow I mean can it get shallower than this? Captain Archer is the one who made the final decision and should take the blame for the fatal consequence. The buck stops with him. Period. As for why he decides to spend 3 days exploring the star while he has a science officer in his team better qualified for this mission is beyond me We have proof (once again) that Captain Archer is a despicable and self-centered character.Also the love story between the tactical officers is forgotten completely half way through the episode. What's the point?? And to see that a TNG actor directed this episode, I'm even more perplexed at the poor quality of this episode. Will Enterprise ever get out of the dark abyss it now rests?? I don't really care anymore it's just an appallingly poor series.",1
10,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Cogenitor (TV Episode 2003)",The problem of ethnocentrism,"Gene Roddenberry's vision for Star Trek was for a show that dealt with real world issues through the guise of science fiction and that is exactly what this episode is. ""Cogenitor"" is a classic original series episode. Here Brannon and Rick have written us a story where we have first contact with a new and interesting society coupled with a tale of human rights that will leave some Trekkers angry and other's completely satisfied.In the first episode of Enterprise, ""Broken Bow"", T'pol tells Trip that it is easy to judge a culture you do not understand and we see that come full circle here in ""Cogenitor"". Trip's enthnocentric behavior clashes with his belief in human rights. Although this episode does not directly deal with race it is clearly an allegory for it, but with a few more complications. For us racism is based solely on a difference of skin color. For the Vissians their treatment of the cogenitors is a question of survival. Without them facilitating reproduction on a constant basis the entire species will become extinct. This creates complications when trying to impose our beliefs on a culture we have only known for a few days. A society where cogenitors can freely go about their lives however they want and choosing not to be treated as anything more than a sex slave will eventually lead to the extinction of the Vissians. Archer's decision, although wrong from our point of view, is more complicated than a simple question of human rights. His choice to return the cogenitor and its death may have ended a life, but it very well could have saved an entire race. ""Cogenitor"" is a thoughtful and intelligent story that gives us a more complex allegory for racism that poses a lot of questions, more than a few of, which do not have a right answer.",8
11,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Cogenitor (TV Episode 2003)","Good science fiction, bad Star Trek",I'd been enjoying watching 'Enterprise' right up until this episode.Star Trek has always been about morality - about doing and demonstrating the right thing.So what the actual heck was this? What message was this sending? Was this author REALLY trying to say that we should leave people oppressed if teaching them to want more will cause them to hate their life? That CULTURE is somehow more valuable than PEOPLE? I've never been so angry as I was after watching this episode. This should never have been accepted for Star Trek. This is the opposite of the values Star Trek has always promoted.,1
12,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Cogenitor (TV Episode 2003)",About as subtle as a Ferengi in a clown-suit,"Unlike some people, I do like Enterprise and I do like its first two seasons for their often slow pace and their attempt to show a Starfleet-crew doing actual exploring. With gems like ""Minefield"" or ""A Night in Sickbay"" a lot of my personal favorites come from season 2. However: ""Cogenitor"" isn't one of them ... far from it, actually.The whole point of the story is pretty obvious: It's another one of those Enterprise-episodes that are meant to explore the path(s) that lead to the creation of established Trek-lore - in this case, the Prime Directive. That's all well and good - after all: Enterprise is a prequel-show and should explore those aspects of early Starfleet-missions and how they shaped the world of TOS and TNG.The execution is clunky at best though. While exploring a star, Enterprise meets another ship on a similar mission, populated by a friendly, helpful and more advanced people. Archer and the alien captain immediately like each other and decide to go on a three-day-mission together. They *really* must like each other a lot BTW, since the small capsule they use doesn't seem to have a bathroom or even a sink on board ... yikes! Anyway: Meanwhile, Malcolm gets to establish a very close relationship with the aliens' hot (and female) security-chief (good for him) and Trip gets a free lesson in advanced warp-engine-design.It's here that the whole thing veers off course. Even though the aliens are more than willing to explain their technology to Trip (an engineer's wet dream, I suppose), he somehow seems more interested in their reproductive-process, which involves a third gender. This third gender, the titular ""Cogenitor"", is treated more like an object than a living being by the aliens: They don't have names, aren't allowed education and are simply assigned to couples who wish to have a baby. Trip switches to the mindset of a 15-year-old, declares the aliens' treatment of the Cogenitors ""inhumane"" and sets off on a personal mission to undermine their culture. Despite repeated warnings from T'Pol he keeps pursuing his mission, teaches the Cogenitor how to read (in one day!) and ends up alienating the aliens and eventually even killing the Cogenitor.Now, the message of the episode couldn't be more obvious. ""Don't judge other cultures, don't interfere with them and, for God's sake, don't show them 'The Day the Earth stood still' or they might end up killing themselves"". That's all well and good, but the way the authors hammer this message home just seems way too constructed and unnatural. At the same time, it makes one of the main characters look like a thick-headed imbecile. Trip is a Commander in Starfleet and it's not like he's out on his first First-Contact-mission. Finding the treatment of the third gender ""wrong"" is one thing, but repeatedly breaking every rule (lying, sneaking behind the aliens' backs) to act on these feelings doesn't seem right for him - even if he is a pre-Prime-Directive-character. It's more like a thing that, in TNG, Wuss-ley Crusher would've done. The only redeeming factors are T'Pol's warnings, Archer's chewing-out of his friend for his stupid actions and, of course, the ending, which actually dares to follow Trip's weird behavior to its logical conclusion.5/10",5
13,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Cogenitor (TV Episode 2003)","Way to totally screw it up, Trip!!!!","When Enterprise is up close examining some cool space phenomenon, they meet up with a new species, the Vissians. These Vissians are very friendly, more advanced and seem like neat new friends. However, one thing about them really intrigued Trip--that they have THREE genders. There are men and women but to actually reproduce, they have a third gender. This is pretty strange but Trip's interest goes much further. He notices that people talk about this third gender more like it's a pet or slave and accord it a much lesser status. These beings are not taught to read or write, have interests of their own and are more like tools than anything else. Trip ascribes human standards to this and sees the third gender as being enslaved and that it is basically unfair. On his own and with no blessing from the Captain, Trip takes it on himself to meet one of these beings and teach it to read and think for itself. Not surprisingly, this ends up causing HUGE problems.This is a very good episode, as it really pushes the idea that other cultures are not necessarily good or bad--just different and interfering could cause HUGE problems. Very interesting--one of the better episodes.By the way, my daughter is sitting next to me and going crazy because in the show, they were playing the Chinese game, GO. And, they were playing it all wrong!! She was incensed and I thought this was freaking hilarious!

There was absolutely No Evidence of the Cogeniter being treated unfairly, or hurt, or anything else we seemed to create in our minds. The fact that they talked about ""it"" made some of you uncomfortable which was what was supposed to happen, yet that language is the Main Difference used as a device to have a Trip (and the rest of us) become upset. Archer was right and Tripp was an idiot for interfering, but then there wouldn't be a good show would there?

18,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Cogenitor (TV Episode 2003)","Facinating, engaging, but frustrating episode in the end","Despite my low score, I recommend seeing this episode because it's certainly interesting and worth discussing. This is one of those Trek episodes where the crew encounters and focuses how to deal with the strange abnormalities of another alien. Something I generally like. The aliens featured in this episode have 3 sexes. Two of the sexes are similar to males and females in terms of raising children and contributing their genetic material. The 3rd sex basically carries, gives birth to and takes care of children in the initial stages for the ""real couple"" before being transferred to the next set of long term parents. The 3rd sex's category represents a very small fraction of their populations and it's essential for them to give birth to many children for the sake of the species. They're treated subserviently. They aren't given access to education or similar rights to the other members of their species. Trip is fascinated by the dynamic of the relations of these aliens and seeks to find out more about them. He scans the brain of the one 3rd sex individual of the alien's party and befriends her/him/it(for the sake of convenience, I'll use her from here on because the part was played by a woman). Trip finds that her mental capabilities are equivalent to the other members of her species, and decides to go about educating her in secret. After a few education sessions she shows a lot of promise, and starts to feel she has a right to what she has been denied. Trip tries to go about letting Enterprise hold her, but to their species, she a rare necessarily valuable commodity. Archer sides with the view of not interfering further. The aliens leave. Then the captain is informed that she killed herself. Then Archer chews out Trip calling him reckless. Trip pretty accurately calls out Archer saying that if Archer was as personally invested in the alien and not captain, he'd want the same thing as Trip. First off, the premise for this story is fabulous. I just disagree with the conclusion the episode delivers. And it really bothers me to have to disagree with the main protagonist of a star trek show. The writers are presumably hoping the audience will side with Archer because of how the specific events turned out, after the fact. I couldn't do this for a few reasons:In life people can make the best possible decision and lose or make the worst possible decision and still win. It happens in gambling all the time, not because it's likely to beat the odds, but because there's a large sample size of chances being taken. Eventually everyone will be surprised by what fate has in store. This episode did nothing to objectively demonstrate that Trip's thinking was flawed. In fact it repeatedly showed that Trip was right to think that she deserved more rights. She demonstrated she was smart. And a valued member of any society should be treated with respect, rather than be played, just because the necessary piece to the puzzle might not have as much power. I could envision these alien's still thriving if they invested more in equal rights.Star Trek has a few instances where it undermines it's mission of being relevant and smart by siding with a message it want to deliver which is overly preachy and obtuse. This is one of those instances. If the aliens weren't warp capable, the captain might have had a point to let the other species decide their own fate. But these aliens were treated as smart and technological as the members of the Enterprise Crew. Although it's easy to take the approach of ""what right does one have to judge and intervene with others?"" It's also easy to think, especially when the others are of similar intelligence, ""what right does one have to not judge or intervene in the affairs of others?"" In a lot of ways I see this episode as mirroring the situations between different cultures and religions in our societies today. We encounter many situations where we're told not to interfere because we might offend the tradition or culture of others with whom we're unfamiliar. Yes, we should understand the culture of others and show respect on first contact. This is exactly what Trip did, but the way. But it's not ideal to abandon one's own ethics or morals because something isn't supposed to make sense. Where would we be if we didn't think of things based on what was supposed to make sense? It's important to respect the culture of others within one's own intellect of what's right and wrong and what does or doesn't make sense. It's cowardice behavior to let people harm others, just because it's their thing, rather than something that can be accounted for with reason and a call for fair play. Advocating for such standoff behavior is like claiming 19th century Americans from the North who didn't have direct interactions with slaves or slave holders had no right or business to object to slavery. Where would we be today if we actually thought like that? I feel with a few tweaks this episode could have been one of the best. They could have established in the episode that the aliens had a more powerful ship or were necessary allies who weren't to be worth angering over this matter. Then Archer could have personally been sympathetic to Trip, but publicly forced to take the exact same action he took in the episode of letting the aliens do their thing. This would have left the viewer with a more interesting situations where we wonder if Trip's investment was or wasn't worth his effort. But No. They took a great episode idea and make it preachy to the wrong conclusion given the narrative they developed. A frustrating episode for this reason. I give it 6 out of 10 because I think a well done bad idea is usually worse than a poorly executed good idea, and this episode is certainly the latter. And many Enterprise episodes from around this time are the former.",6
19,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Cogenitor (TV Episode 2003)","Archer, Stop Being Such a Hypocrite","Cogenitor introduces the Enterprise to a new super-advanced species known as the Vissians. The two ships quickly become chummy as it appears to be the start of a great friendship between the two species. This race has 3 genders and Trip quickly noticed a disparity in the treatment of one of these and attempts to change this.This episode is quite controversial in the ST community. I can definitely see why. Archer's sanctimoniousness hits an all time high in this episode. He berates Trip for doing something he clearly would have done in Trip's situation.Was this inconsistent with Archer's character? Yes, but in real life people can be inconsistent. Archer was quickly becoming friends with the Vissians and Earth had a lot to gain from this new relationship. This might have been the most important contact that humans have made since the Vulcans. Trip's act of defiance has soiled the relationship. Archer lashes out in frustration. It was immature of him but also something I can comprehend him doing. I don't agree with it but I understand his decision-making process. After all the meddling Archer's done, it's strange to see him act like this. Maybe when the intervention is coming from someone else, Archer's pride takes precedent over his morality.It does seem odd though that such an advanced race of people would have these second-class citizens. You would think that they would be intelligent enough to treat everyone with dignity and respect. I just don't buy it.Side note: We never see the end of Reed's subplot with the Vissian he is courting. We just kind of drop it, very odd.The ending to this one is saddening. Archer's decision not to grant asylum causes Charles' suicide, weighing heavily on both Trip & Archer. Archer's reasoning that he can't interfere and judge another culture's customs is both hypocritical and sending a bad message from the Enterprise. I don't expect Star Fleet to make the right decision every time something comes up but you'd hope for them to at least be consistent.",5

Archer actively disses his commander with basically no sympathy whatsover.The episode wasn't bad as much as just wildly uneven. It is very strange watching cpt. Archer go so tough on Trip. Yes, it is certainly understandable that the captain took issue with John's behavior, but to actually scold Trip and blame the suicide on him alone? That's really strong stuff to write for a captain like Archer who usually seeks out the best in his officers.This is I think one of the few episodes of ENT so far where behvarior of an officer is outright dismissed as so far as to almost personally berate him. It is a gutsy choice but ultimately I wonder if the severity of Trip's actions really warranted that final speech.Not a bad episode, but uneven.",6

They bring the bodies back to their base which turns out to be a bad idea as the Borg regenerates after thawing out. It assimilates the research team and returns to space on a stolen cargo ship. It's up to the Enterprise to retrieve the humans and stop the evolving ship.This episode is definitely ""polarizing"" within the Star Trek community (see what I did there?). I'm a big fan of the Borg and anytime it makes an appearance I get a little giddy about seeing it return to screen. I've put a lot of thought into how I feel about ST:E's pseudo-revisionist history. While some of it does change how I look at some of the other show's episodes, I think it's important to release that all of this canonical. Instead of casting it aside, I'm trying to embrace these new story lines and integrate them into the ST universe.Maybe Star Fleet made this report extremely classified and it never saw the light of day again? Maybe since they never found out its name, they never were able to put two and two together? Whatever the case, I did in fact enjoy this episode. It had a lot of horror elements to it which is a nice change of pace from what we normally get out of ST:E. All the acting was good and I enjoyed seeing what was going on back on Earth for a change.This is also one of the few times (maybe the only time?) up to this point that we've seen Archer give the command to kill an alien lifeform. He orders the ship destroyed as he realizes just how dangerous this thing can become.Conclusion: While controversial, I think they do enough not to change future story lines of ST and they make an all around good episode.",9

A crashed borg ship found frozen for 100 yrs. The crew regenerating (as we knew they would... seriously?! put them BACK in deepfreeze), assimilating the arctic crew, and heading to delta quad, gaining as many humanoids as possible along the way. ENT crew not only has to stop the ship and hopefully try to get the crew back but they find out just how resilient the aliens can be... stonger, more intelligent and goal oriented, able to adapt to phaser frequencies.... deja vue but also new.

Yes: there are some things that don't add up with the wider Star Trek Universe; but if your day is going to be ruined by different accounts of how long it takes for a message to get somewhere in a fictional universe then it might be time to open a window and pop the kettle on. There are also couple of lines which feel awkward and redundant, but watching it over they're for the benefit of people who may not be obsessively familiar with the speed a message sent by subspace takes to reach some place that doesn't exist. Now the good: this is a blooming good episode. Awkward lines not withstanding, its well written episode and weaves into many different episodes and films really well. There are some great little nods to other episodes and films too which, as a Trekkie, I always enjoy. The plot though is great, and really plays on what I tend to do when a film ends: ""Well... what happened to...?"". Borg rising from the frozen wastes, trying to get back to the Delta Quadrant, classic Borg mood-lighting and the tingle up your spine when you see them lumbering around. It plays well on what many Trekkies love, and that is the Borg.Also, not mentioned in other reviews: the musical score for this episode is a gem for setting the tone and feel of the narrative and really compliments the pace and ominous and unrelenting ambient behind it all.As far as Enterprise episodes go this is by far one of the best, if not THE best.

There are no continuity errors as some fans, who clearly don't pay attention to the shows, would like to say.The writing staff took a great amount of effort to ensure there were no continuity errors, if the errors exist, they aren't from Star Trek: Enterprise, instead they would arise from Star Trek: First Contact.Let me explain. In First Contact, they leave a vessel with borg in it on a past earth crashed in the Arctic. They just leave it there! No cares to whether the borg in the ship could later on cause problems! In Star Trek: Enterprise, this vessel is found. At the end of Regeneration they find out the Borg sent a subspace transmission to the Delta Quadrant and it'd take 200 years to get there, placing that transmission roughly around the TNG period. It literally effects nothing about the timeline of the borg invasion.That means Star Trek: Enterprise takes place after First Contact, which makes perfect sense, since the TNG crew went back to the time of Zephram Cochrane and fought the borg, Cochrane being pre- Enterprise.In TNG the borg never say ""We are the borg"", yet in ENT they do, meaning that in TNG, they did not know they were making their first contact with the borg till much later.Anyway, phenomenal acting, and definitely not when this series jumped the shark.

Not knowing what kind of aliens they are the explorers dig the Borg out of the ice and bring them to their camp. There the Borg suddenly awake and assimilate the exploration team. They go into the explorers' vessel and attack a transporter vessel. The Enterprise picks up the transporter's emergency call and beams two survivors aboard the Enterprise. But the survivors have already been assimilated and suddenly assimilate Dr. Phlox. Finally Captain Archer manages to get rid of the two Borg while the Borg nano probes attack Dr. Phlox's immune system. The Enterprise follows the explorers' vessel which has been altered by the Borg and now can fly much faster and also has an improved defense system.

The doctor gets infected with nanoprobes but the result is pretty much a joke. It took Data in the episode Best of both worlds all his knowledge and effort to bring Loqutus (picard) back human and it ONLY worked cause he wasn't fully assimilated.

Up until then, this awful group of assimilators were never seen on the show before and they were a complete surprise to the crew. They also soon became huge and exciting enemies on the various other Trek shows. However, ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" is set something like 200 years BEFORE all this. So how can the crew have an encounter with the Borg in the 22nd century and yet no one in the 24th century knew about them?! Huh?! This just doesn't make any sense--especially since with computers and so much data on the Borg you wonder HOW this could be.When the show begins, some frozen Borg are discovered by scientists. Amazingly, although they were frozen for a very, very long time, one of the seemingly dead Borg revives and begins doing what Borg do best--assimilating the crap out of everything. Soon these scientists are all Borg and when Enterprise comes to help, it is nearly destroyed by these jerks.In addition to the inconsistency of even having the Borg in the show, it's very inconsistent how Dr. Phlox is assimilated. Normally, within seconds a being becomes a full-fledge Borg drone. Yet, inexplicably, his transformation is VERY slow and is later easily reversed! Again, the correct response is...huh?!Despite all these annoying errors that violate canon, the show is reasonably exciting. For folks who don't care about these problems, I'd give this one a 7.

Apparently he gets hoisted on his own Picard. Oh, wait, the chronology is so confusing. Hey, I'm just having a little fun. I love you guys who are so involved in these shows that you will give an episode a one because it doesn't fit in with the world you have studied to the exclusion of the real world you live in. I thought this was very exciting. I was surprised to see the Borg show up. If those other shows make your findings factual, why can't this one? I mean, it is a part of the Star Trek canon now that it's been put on television. You need to fill in your time lines with some new stuff.

Berman, who can almost single-handedly be blamed for destroying the Star Trek franchise has no business being in charge of anything. He needs to pursue a more suitable career, perhaps as a garbage man or Walmart greeter, something more akin to his (non)abilities.This episode is a grand example of Berman's pitiful skills. He has no respect for canon. And when the series is failing miserably, he resorts to his ace in the hole, desperation slight of hand - the Borg. It didn't work on Voyager and sure as heck did not work on Enterprise! It requires a complete shelving of any logic to think that Janeway and Voyager could hold the Borg at bay, especially considering the thorough beating one Borg cube did to a large part of Starfleet at Wolf 359. And Archer and his Tonka Toy star ship and pathetic weaponry are going to fare well against the Borg? Puh-leaze! Gimme a break! Let's see...sometimes the Borg adapted themselves to the Starfleet weapons and were able to repel them and then in the next scene, other Borg were getting killed? Who wrote this krap??? And amazingly, Phlox was able to cure himself of Borgification?? And oh, by the way...did Archer's logs get lost at some point so that Picard and Enterprise D were completely clueless about the Borg??",2
11,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Regeneration (TV Episode 2003)",What about Q introducing the Borg?!,"Okay, I rarely give out reviews, but this one irked me so much I have to. First off, if you are any sort of Star Trek fan, from The Next Generation to Voyager, or The Original Series to Deep Space 9, and you see this episode, all you can really think is wtf is this crap.First, the Borg have NO business being in any series that takes place prior to the timeline that exists with The Next Generation. If you've ever seen that series, you would know that Q from the Q Continuum, who both started the series up and ended the series with a bang, was the one who introduced the Enterprise - D to the Borg.Now, some may say ""well they didn't introduce themselves as the Borg."" I call bull. Basically in this episode, you have researchers on a frozen planet find some frozen bodies of a cybernetic race and the nanos in their bodies regenerate them and yada yada. Then they escape the planet and attack a vessel - same thing there.Enterprise finds the vessel, gets two people who were infected with the nanos, and they attack Phlox - injecting him with their tubules. Archer is eventually forced to shoot them out of an airlock and help Phlox with omicron radiation to rid his body of the nanos.Other crap happens which I just stopped paying attention to because I thought the episode was utter crap, and a message with Earth's coordinates was sent out to the Delta quadrant which Archer says will take about 200 years.Down to the nitty gritty. The Borg technology is basically as advanced as it is in say TNG or VOY. Why? I mean, if it is that advanced now, and there is a 200 year gap between now and then, and other species will have been assimilated, then how the bleep can this technology not be even more advanced 200 years from this episode? Then, they say that Zefram Cochrane said in a speech there was a cybernetic race that wanted to enslave humanity and because he wasn't taken seriously he recanted it later on. Okay soooo Enterprise would have to report this incident and recite his speech, saying that he may have potentially been serious and only recanted so as not to seem crazy. Which would have put this in the history books as first contact with the cybernetic race. There was no mention of anything like this when Q introduced them to Jean-Luc Picard. Nor was any mention made in the movie Star Trek: First Contact of Cochrane wanting to give a speech regarding the cybernetic life.Just so many points of this episode make no sense when it comes to the facts of the Star Trek Universe. It is completely non-canon because there is no way that this report wouldn't have made it into Starfleet and no way that it wouldn't be taught to future cadets that there was some cybernetic race lurking out there waiting to attack Earth.",1

And that's why star trek is so great and why we all love it, because it evokes debate and discussion about our beloved franchise.Personally I think this is a solid Borg episode! And actually up there with one of the strongest in Season 2 of Enterprise. Really exciting, the nods to First contact are nicely done, subtle but apparent.

13,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Regeneration (TV Episode 2003)","A perfect example of ""Enterprise""","When this ""Star Trek"" prequel series debuted we wondered if it would attempt to fit into the established history leading up to TOS or if it would rewrite history. I think they tried to hint at both to please old and new fans alike, but the latter is obviously where they were going. In the movie ""First Contact"" we saw Picard's TNG crew go back in time and alter first contact between humans and Vulcans, which was the entire basis for the formation of Starfleet and the Federation, so it stands to reason that everything that follows would be altered, sometimes in subtle ways and sometimes not so subtle. How many of Cochrane's crew were killed, what role would they have played in the creation of the Phoenix or relations with the Vulcans? How were Cochrane's attitudes and actions altered by his encounter with Picard's crew? Cochrane appeared on the pilot episode of ""Enterprise"" showing that this new timeline would follow on from that movie. Now in season 2's ""Regeneration"" we did up some leftover Borg from the movie just to hammer home the point that this is a continuation of that movie. Even though Archer remembers some random bit of nonsense Cochrane had muttered 100 years earlier that everyone else wrote off as a drunken yarn, apparently his encounter with the Borg will not be remembered 200 years later when Shelby is researching the Borg in preparation for their invasion of the Alpha Quadrant. Or will it be, in this timeline? If Archer had gone 200 years into the future perhaps he would have encountered a very different TNG than the one we watched on our TVs.Yet the episode ends with a warning that the Borg contacted their friends in the Delta Quadrant and they should get the signal right around the time Picard is captaining his Enterprise. So the writers choose to rewrite history but not too much, leaving the appearance of perhaps fitting with the old history. It's a bit of having your cake and eating it too. Or perhaps more a case of rewriting continuity but not having the guts to actually do it in any meaningful way. I find this kind of thing unappealing to the old-school fan but too business- as-usual to please a newcomer.As for the actual plot, the Borg continue their magical evolution into indestructibility. We saw on Voyager that they could revive a drone that had been dead for several days. Now they can revive drones that have been dead 100 years or more! Not just frozen in ice for 100 years, but who have also survived the destruction of their ship by photon torpedoes, survived the heat of entry into Earth's atmosphere and a rather harsh impact onto the ground from orbit. Those magical Borg.The action plays more like a horror movie with a bunch of zombies infecting humans and multiplying possibly without end unless they can be stopped. It's a serviceable but predictable action episode that has been seen many times before. Where is the promise of this first encounter with an entirely different culture, not just a hive mind but now an enemy who absorbs everything it touches? Not unlike the one Enterprise encountered in ""Vox Sola."" This time however there's no emotion, no surprise, just action. I guess if they found out too much about the Borg it might just finally break the canon irreversibly so they couldn't go there. Couldn't have Phlox learn the species' name while he was mind linked with them, for instance. Just like they never learned the Ferengi's name because that would wreck Picard's first contact with them 200 years down the road.This is all the same road JJ Abrams took with the 2009 ""Star Trek"" movie. Not surprising that would name-check Archer as his movie is a continuation of ""Enterprise's"" altered timeline and alters it further. Another remake that tries to change things but keep enough the same that it could still kinda-sorta fit with the old stories, but really can't, not at all. In the attempt to offend no one they created a product that I don't see how it can please anyone. It's very boxed into an old product which limits where it can go, while it really doesn't fit into the box either. This episode shows exactly what's wrong with ""Enterprise"" and Abrams' Trek.",3

First of a lot of people hate it, because they forget or don't reanalyze that the episode is a continuation of the movie Star Trek: First Contact, so as always when time-travel is involved there will be discussions about how it changes/effects the canon we know and love where Q shows TNG the Borg. But the episode also has some really big mistakes, 1. In one scene the Borg adapted themselves to the Starfleet phasers, and then in the next scene other Borgs are killed when shot with phasers. 2. Phlox was able to cure himself of the Borg infection. There for 4/10 from me, because while I like the salute to Star Trek: First Contact, there are too many mistakes in the canon toward the Borg.",4

Picard killed them with Quantum Torpedoes (X4) and that Borg Sphere was utterly destroyed...but let us put that to one side for now and talk about what happens in the actual episode.So, apparently some Borg survive and crash/land in the arctic circle, freezing them until awoken, which when happens they leave Earth and try to get to Borg Space.This simply does not make any sense...their mission was to stop 'First Contact' and assimilate Earth...so why travel back to Borg Space? Why not, send a message to Borg space from Earth, but continue to Assimilate Earth? One on each continent? Multiply and slowly take over Earth? And, if you are going to change cannon, then Q would not have 'flung' Enterprise D into the borders of Guinan's home in the El-Aurian system as a lesson, as the lesson would not have made a point, because Humans would have already had 'a taste of their future'.So yeah, dumb episode and is basically what happens when you are Rick Berman and you run out of ideas, and want to try and get your viewer figures up: You create an anachronistic nightmare, alienate the fans and ruin Star Trek, again.His logic undoes his logic.",1

As T'Pol and Archer are on some mundane (but pretty) mission, Archer talks about his old friend, A.G. Robinson (Keith Carradine)--as he's just received word that the guy died. The story goes back about a decade before Enterprise is launched. At that time, Archer and Robinson are test pilots and they're working on a warp engine program. At first the pair are rivals and go through a stupid macho fist fight (the low point of the show) but later team up to work on the project--which is a problem as the Vulcans have convinced the humans to put this warp project on hold.This is a decent but not great episode of the show. However, while I complained about the fight, I did really like the very final line by T'Pol--it was actually rather sweet.",7
3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" First Flight (TV Episode 2003)",The Prequel To The Prequel,"Enterprise, as it was known without the Star Trek prefix for its first couple of years, was promoted as being a prequel series to the original Star Trek TV series. Yet for much of that same time frame, it could easily have been just another Star Trek show as the crew seemed to wander the galaxy far from home and often out of contact with Starfleet. Indeed the only way to know it was a prequel series was the less than advanced technology and the occasional first contact with one of the better known alien races of the series. Occasionally through, it would be what it was meant to be. First Flight, airing late in the show's second season, was just such an episode.When initially pitched, Enterprise was intended to be far more a prequel series than it eventually became. One of the earliest notions for the series was the idea of exploring the early days of Starfleet and the leading up to the building of the first star ship. While the idea was eventually all but scrapped, this is the closest fans would get to the original notion behind the series. Pulling inspiration from the Tom Wolffe book and 1983 film The Right Stuff, First Flight takes viewers into the early days of the NX program as Archer remembers his recently deceased friend Robinson played by actor Keith Carradine. With big changes coming to Enterprise just two episodes later in the season finale The Expanse, this might well have been the show's last (if somewhat belated) chance to tell this story.Drawing inspiration as it does from The Right Stuff, the episode works very well indeed. There's references and indeed nostalgia for those early days of space flight with scenes of Archer, Robinson and members of Starfleet sharing drinks in a bar that echo the real-life Poncho's Happy Bottom Riding Club that existed at Edwards Air Force Base during the 1940s and 1950s. The cockpit of the NX prototypes, NX Alpha and NX Beta, along with the flight suits worn by the Starfleet pilots also call to mind the early days of the space program as astronauts sat in cramped space capsules, wearing pressure suits and wondering if they might not live through the flight. Though obstinately set in the future, First Flight is full of earning to those heady days, the excitement and the danger that went along with them.It's in the flashback sequences that the episode is at its best. It's fun to watch Scott Bakula playing a younger, even reckless version of Archer who yearns to get out there and enters into a not so friendly rivalry at times with Keith Carradine's Robinson. Carradine's Robinson makes for an interesting foil for Bakula's Archer as the man are quite alike though whereas Archer is trying to live up to his father's legacy, Robinson seems most keen on just flying. Robinson comes across as a proto-Kirk in that respect, much more so than Archer ever does across four seasons of Enterprise. Also, their rivalry calls to mind that of aviators Chuck Yeager (the US pilot who became the first to break the sound barrier) and Scott Crossfield which is portrayed in the book of The Right Stuff. The episode also shows us the beginning of the friendship between Archer and Trip Tucker, something that both Bakula and Conner Trinneer play nicely. From an acting point of view, First Flight is a solid episode especially for Bakula.Where the episode is at some fault is in its structure. The episode is largely told in flashbacks, something that Enterprise had done before with its 1950s set episode Carbon Creek. Yet whereas the nature of that episode meant that interrupting the flashbacks not only worked but was necessary, here it is considerably less successful. It might be in part because the framing story, which features Archer telling T'Pol about the events while they're in a shuttlepod while investigating a dark matter nebula, might be the cause of that as the dialogue is at best functional and laughable at its worst (it might also be worth mentioning that dark matter had already been investigated in the earlier Enterprise episode Breaking The Ice but never mind). The flashback nature also undermines some of the episode's mini-cliffhangers at the commercial breaks, especially one early in the episode that is set around the apparent death of a character whom we know isn't dead that leads to an immensely melodramatic moment. The flashback structure isn't perfect but it gets the job done, even if the results are less than satisfactory at times.Despite issues with its structure, First Flight is still largely a success. The performances and the flashbacks are all solid, allowing Enterprise to tell a story quite unlike any other in its run. It's also a chance to view the series that Enterprise might have been had things gone differently, if it hadn't effectively spent years sitting on its laurels repeating the show's clichés or telling the ill-defined Temporal Cold War story before a mid-course correction that came too little too late. Instead this is a story of humanity reaching out for the stars with hope and perseverance, always at the brink of the known. It's what Star Trek, and Enterprise especially, is at its best though I can only wish we had gotten more episodes like this.",7
4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" First Flight (TV Episode 2003)",Good Back History,"Captain Archer gets news that a man named Robinson has died in a mountain climbing accident. It turns out this man was really important to him, and he is very emotional about the death. Archer decides to explore a nebula and T'Pol insists on joining him. On the way, Archer tells her who Robinson was and why he was so important. It turns out that Archer and Robinson were both hotshot pilots and when Archer's dad built the first warp engine for the earth travelers, Robinson was chosen to take the first test flight. He's a hard head and causes the ship to fall apart, barely escaping with his life. This leads to the Vulcans wanting to put the kabosh on the earth's space program. Most of the episode is about what the two of them do when they hear the program has been postponed indefinitely. It's a nice change of pace episode.",7
5,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" First Flight (TV Episode 2003)",Archer's First Flight,"""First Flight"" is a flashback episode, taking us back to the earlier years of Star Fleet when Earth was still trying to build up its warp program. This flashback is given to us in the form of a story by Captain Archer to T'Pol when he learns of the death of his old friend/rival. We get a little bit of insight into how the program started, Archer's back story, and why he is the captain of the Enterprise today. This is the type of episode I'd like to see more of in the next two seasons of ST:E. We get a closer look at the program and even get to see how Archer and Trip meet which is nice. I wasn't a huge fan of the format, taking us back to present day and the nebula T'Pol and Archer were exploring. It took me completely out of it and distracted from the more important plotline. Just staying in the past the entire episode would have worked better. From this it seemed like Archer has always been a bit of a prideful guy, taking exception for not being chosen for the first flight. At times, he sure can be not very likeable. I also cringed at the terrible ""taking a Vulcan with you"" joke they make in the flashback. Can the writers wink at the audience anymore than that?Conclusion: This episode isn't exactly fantastic but its enjoyable enough.",6

However, this episode is dedicated to T'Pol, more precisely to the sexy Jolene Blalock, who has a very erotic performance.

When the show begins, Trip and Archer are attacked and Archer is taken prisoner by a Tellarite. It seems that the Klingons put a bounty on him after he escaped from their custody (""Judgment"", episode 2, 19). Much of the episode consists of their voyage across space to meet up with the Klingons.The other plot is a doozy that will probably appeal to very horny teenagers but is frankly very embarrassing. When T'Pol and Phlox go on a mission, some strange infection necessitates keeping themselves in isolation--but the same infection has somehow induced Pon Farr-- the Vulcan mating urge. Through most of the show, T'Pol is an incredibly frisky lady and demands the Doctor service her! And, throughout all this, she's nearly naked.

Let's forget for a moment that Jolene Blylock is not particularly sexy (Don't confuse slutty with sexy, they are two different things), we're led to believe she has prematurely entered the Pon Farr - the equivalent of 'going into heat' for the Vulcans. The Original Series establishes that only Vulcan males enter Pon Farr and they must return to their home world to mate or they will die. T'Pol is neither male nor does the Enterprise return to Vulcan to prevent her death. Instead Blylock is used as a pin-up fantasy by lazy writers to illicit fan-boy lust. Oh, there was another storyline this episode, something about a bounty. I guess that's why the episode is named Bounty, but the viewer isn't expected to care much about that. This one is clearly all about the awkward sexual tension between Phlox and T'pol in which neither actor can really stay in character because they both clearly feel dirty and used.

This one isn't one of the better episodes of Season 2. The plot involving T'Pol's illness felt like an excuse to sexualize T'Pol and it wasn't appreciated. A Vulcan having sexuality is fine but not the way T'Pol's portrayed in this episode. I could do without anymore like that. Archer's subplot is more interesting but doesn't make a whole lot of sense. If this bounty hunter is piloting this ""piece of junk"" as he calls it, how in the world is it able to disable the Enterprise? It's practically a shuttle! Then Archer decides to instigate things further with the Vulcans by agreeing to this hairbrained scheme straight out of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly where he allows his new friend to collect the bounty on him before escaping capture. It seemed far too risky to attempt. I guess the main plot development in this one that Archer has now strained even further his relationship with the Klingons.

Meanwhile, the Klingon fugitive subplot is kept alive as Enterprise is pursued by Klingon Birds of Prey (this is really just added to provide some additional action in an otherwise sedate episode, since it has no bearing on the central plot), and Enterprise is refitted with better hull plating and antimatter torpedoes (completely scientifically absurd, but the franchise hasn't really been very concerned with science since DS9 so who cares).The acting is a touch above the average for this series. The script allows Conner Trinnear to capitalize on American emotions surrounding the 9/11 attack on the U.S.A., as he turns in one of his finest performances during this series. Jolene Blalock also does a very nice job with one of T'Pol's more complicated early interpretations (this character has one of the best arcs in the series, and becomes much more interesting in the 3rd and 4th seasons).

The Suliban kidnap Archer and set up a meeting between him and their time-traveling overlord who informs Archer of the culiprit is a species located in the Delphic Expanse known as the Xindi. The Enterprise heads towards the great unknown, a place feared by the Vulcans and Klingons. Meanwhile, Duras continues to pursue Captain Archer and bring him back to Kronos to restore his honor. This episode is a bit of a transition, as we leave the plot of the Vulcans trying to capture Archer and head towards this new threat. The cliffhanger sets up the main story plot lines of season 3 and I have no issue with this. Sure, it might be convenient that future shows never mention this race or the national disaster that occurred back in the day but that doesn't mean it didn't happen. I don't go around talking about the Great Chicago Fire everyday, why shouldn't future generations think of this simarly? While I did enjoy the episode and what it sets up, this one isn't exactly perfect. The scanner that reads the UFO and gives a negative age to the alloy was pretty dumb. T'Pol's complicated decision to resign her post with the Vulcan High Command and stay with the Enterprise is basically glossed over. While the grief shown by Trip over the loss of his sister is one of the best performances we see out of him, I could have used more of it. This probably should have been a 2 part episode. It also looks like we've seen the end of Duras as Archer's fancy new weapons (which are borderline ridiculous I might add) dispatch his ship into a million pieces on the edge of the Expanse. Archer's quick to believe this time traveler for no reason. He's the leader of the Suliban Cabal, a bitter enemy to the Enterprise. Why believe him? Why trust him? Because he had general knowledge of the ship? Archer's thinking too emotionally. If it's the Xindi's idea to destroy Earth before humans destroy them and they are building a weapon to accomplish this, then why show up early and do a minor attack? You don't poke the bear unless you can kill it! The entire premise that they'd come and kill a few million instead of total annihilation is counterintuitive.

I did not like the music score theme, which I found very annoying, but this was an exception in this great show. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Broken Bow""",9
1,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Broken Bow: Part I (TV Episode 2001)",Gene Roddenberry Would Be Proud,"""Broken Bow"" takes us back to where it all began. Set 150 years in our future and 100 years before Kirk, Spock and McCoy. This installment of the ""Star Trek"" franchise, is in my opinion the first series since ""TOS"" to recapture the feelings of wonder, danger and excitement of ""Going Where No Man Has Gone Before"". Scott Bakula is perfectly cast as Jonathan Archer, the first Captain of the first ""Star Ship Enterprise"". He and the entire cast truly show a true reverence for the Star Trek legacy. John Billingsley is Brilliant as the alien Dr. Phlox, and Jolene Blalock is totally luscious as the tempting but logical Vulcan science officer T'Pol. Broken Bow is in my opinion the best premier episode of any of the Treks, and I believe Gene Roddenberry would surely be proud.",10
2,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Broken Bow: Part I (TV Episode 2001)",Going where no trek has gone before...,"Enterprise, the latest high budget spin-off to the most successful franchise in film and or television history opens to the tune of a 90-minute episode called 'Broken Bow'. First we are swept into a massive action sequence with a Klingon being chased by some Suliban (who are the main enemy in the first season of the show). From there the televised movie takes us on a journey that seldom gets as good as it is, with some of the best character development, story and action/visual effects ever seen in such a short amount of time.The opening-credits is a debatable subject among the minority of Enterprise fans, whom some believe that the song is out of place. What they fail to realise is the lyrics themselves. If one listens to the actual song, instead of the theme, then they will begin to piece the parts of the puzzle together. And eventually as the series progresses further and further, and we learn more about our valiant captain and his crew, will the song actually become meaningful. Overall Diane Warren's theme is beautifully orchestrated and is sung just as well by opera singer Russell Watson.What makes any television show watchable and worth watching time and time again is its characters and the way they become structured and layered. Enterprise is (in my opinion) one of the most well cast shows since The Next Generation. Choosing Scott Bakula, as Captain Jonathan Archer was the best decision since Gene himself cast Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard. As the captain always leads the show, Bakula adds a subtlety to his role and brings a huge smile to the faces of anyone with blood pumping in their veins. He simply is (both actor wise and character wise) a superb human being and his charm, wit, and compassion are overwhelming to watch. As for the other cast members, a favourite of mine is John Billingsley who plays Dr. Phlox. It's also nice to see a non-human playing a role, and the decision to give the captain a dog, named 'Porthos' was a well-received idea. Throughout the show character development was brilliant, it was fast, well timed and almost perfect. I say almost because sadly Travis Mayweather's character played by the Briton Anthony Montgomery is a little weak at the end of the first season. He does have some things to say here and there, but remains in the hands of the producers to make him more important. Jolene Blalock is wonderful as the sometimes harsh but equally loveable Subcommander T'Pol. Dominic Keating as Lieutenant Malcolm Reed plays a strong role and is convincing as the armoury officer. Connor Trinneer plays Commander Charles ""Trip"" Tucker who always adds charm and comedic style to his character and finally Linda Park as Ensign Hoshi Sato, who often plays a weaker character but thankfully quickly becomes interesting. All of these characters make up Enterprise, and all bring a quality that Star Trek hasn't seen in a long time. Each person makes this show worth watching. Smiles and feel-good senses are guaranteed right from the first time we see them all together on the bridge of the starship Enterprise NX-01.The ship itself, the NX-01 is somewhat questionable in design. The series is set 150 years from now and 100 years before Captain Kirk. So why then does the ship appear to be similar in design to mid 24th century ships, namely the Akira class starship? Continuity has been an issue in Enterprise, but thankfully Rick [Berman] and Brannon [Braga] offer suitable explanations for each and everyone of them. Continuity is only a problem if you are forever scrutinising shows and are obsessed with the tiniest of details. If you see the show with and open mind, then you'll have no problems, but there is an urge to know 'why' all the time. So what did Berman and Braga offer to the Star Trek fan-base with the issue of the deign of the ship itself? According to them the NX-01 is how it is because of the incident in First Contact. When Zefram Cochrane saw the Enterprise-E through his telescope and from speaking with the away team lead by Commander Riker, it changed the ideas in his head. That's a good enough explanation for me.lets move on. Of course its not as easy for some fans to accept that sort of answer, some go as far as to refuse to see the show until they get a reasonable answer. Come on guys grow up.When George Lucas destroyed the Star Wars saga with the launch of his profit making new trilogy, fans couldn't do anything, only watch and sap it all up anyway. And then they learned that, well maybe its not that bad after all. If you can't accept a quality show for what it is, not what it should be in your mind, then go elsewhere. Or try becoming a producer on the show and then see what you can do.The sets on Enterprise remind me very much of the Defiant from Deep Space Nine. They often appear cold and have an eerie look of modern structure to them and they cry out that they belong to the military. Perhaps that why the crew of the USS Enterprise (aka flagship of the American fleet) like it so much.  They are striking sets, and represent the show perfectly.
Rick Berman 'the overlord of the empire' as John Logan so accurately put it and his counterpart Brannon Braga has hit the nail on the head exactly where they should have, and in all the right places.  Whether that be technicalities, visuals, sound, editing or score. Enterprise is a fine demonstration to just how good televised science fiction can ultimately be, when in the hands of geniuses. The late Gene Roddenberry would be proud of this series and as a Star Trek fan, so should you.",10
3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Broken Bow: Part I (TV Episode 2001)",Star Trek like you've never seen before.,"Before I start, I would like to say to all those hard-core Star Trek fans out there that unlearn what you have learned.  Okay, I got that from Yoda, but it still holds true here.  When watching and critiquing (if you're a nit-picker), one must approach the new series with an open mind.Expectations aside, I thoroughly enjoyed Enterprise.  The fifth installment into the Star Trek series franchise peaked my interest months ago when I first heard about it.  I was skeptical at first, I will admit to that.  I just didn't want another Star Trek: Voyager, which I spent that last 7 years faithfully watching the show with little to no satisfaction when it came to an end.  But when Scott Bakula signed on, Dr. Sam Beckett himself, I denounced all skepticism and it sparked my enthusiasm for the new series. Right off the bat, Enterprise threw us into the thick of things:  the Klingon, Klaang, evading the Suliban, the Vulcan/Human conflict, the problematic temporal cold war, and the cameo by James Cromwell.  Okay, those are more like intriguing features than throwing us into the thick of things. What can I say?  I was impressed. The matter of the title song is quite a controversy among friends.  Many thought it should go.  I say, keep it.  It's different and in a way sentimental, paying homage to exploration and discovery.  I took me five viewings of the pilot to get used to it. Enterprise delivers in every way possible that a Star Trek series should: a bold captain, a diverse crew, technobabble, transporters, phasers, shuttlepods, warp drive, and humor. For all those who don't like Enterprise, I say this to you:  give the show some time.  It's still a newborn, finding its own way to be unique, exciting, and most of all appealing.  Remember, many people didn't get into Deep Space Nine when it first came on.  It grew to be a fantastic series. It might not have rated well with the hard-core fans, but there are more than plenty enough serious fans who think so. Enterprise may very well become the best Star Trek series since The Next Generation.",
4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Broken Bow: Part I (TV Episode 2001)",Strong start overall,"A strong pilot, this two-hour episode does an excellent job of setting up the characters and background for ""Enterprise,"" the ""prequel"" to the original ""Star Trek"" series. It stumbles a few times into ""Trek"" convention and cliché--candy-colored space strippers never seem to go out of style, and I can already foresee snickering references to T'pol as ""Seven of Vulcan""--but the ensemble looks strong, the characters are well-drawn, and one can already see hints that this particular crew will have to be more resourceful, in different ways, than those of earlier (later?) series. Scott Bakula hits the right note as a captain with Kirk's brashness and daring but without his smugness and swagger, and I look forward to the ways in which the series will feature the engineer, weapons master and communications officer (not just a glorified phone operator anymore!) as supporting players. The writers seem to have picked up on the one big mistake made in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" ""Deep Space 9"" and ""Voyager"": Instead of starting with a big ensemble cast and giving characters short shrift, it's starting with a smaller core of characters to which a little more variety can be added later--which I hope happens, because after about a half-dozen episodes, more variety will be needed.",7
5,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Broken Bow: Part I (TV Episode 2001)",The prequel to Star Trek,"Just saw Enterprise: Broken Bow, and I would have to say that it is different.  It's like one hundred years before Kirk and it's interesting to see how Starfleet gets to where we know it.  The uniforms are different than the standard color coordination that Star Trek has used before.  It's more of a more military look.  The starship shots are all computer generated, on The Next Generation they used models, boy I miss that.  Great way to start off a new show, especially when they used the transporter on a human for the first time.  The show looks to be promising from this pilot.",
6,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Broken Bow: Part I (TV Episode 2001)",Solid Trek,"Okay, the recent history of Star Trek has not been good.  The Next Generation faded in its last few seasons, DS9 boldly stayed where no one had stayed before, and Voyager started very bad and never really lived up to its promise.  So, when they announced a new Star Trek series, I did not have high expectations.  And, the first episode, Broken Bow, did have some problems.  But, overall it was solid Trek material and a good romp.I'll get the nits out of the way first.  The opening theme is dull and I don't look forward to sitting through it regularly, but that's what remotes are for.  What was really bad was the completely gratuitous lotion rubbing scene that just about drove my wife out of the room.  They need to cut that nonsense out.But, the plot was strong and moved along well.  The characters, though still new, seem to be well rounded and not always what you would expect.  The Vulcans are clearly being presented very differently than before, with a slightly ominous theme.  I particularly liked the linguist, who is the first Star Trek character to not be able to stand proud in the face of death, but rather has to deal with her phobias and fears.  They seemed to stay true to Trek lore, something that has been a significant problem in past series, though they have plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through shields, the instant invention of technology that can fix anything, and the inevitable plethora of time-travel stories.  Anyone want to start a pool on how long before the Borg show up?All in all, the series has enormous potential.  They are seeing the universe with fresh eyes.  We have the chance to learn how things got the way they were in the later series.  How did the Klingons go from just insulting to war?  How did we meet the Romulans?  How did the Federation form and just who put Earth in charge.  Why is the prime directive so important?  If they address these things rather than spitting out time travel episodes, this will be an interesting series.My favorite line:  Zephram Cochran saying ""where no man has gone before"" (not ""no one"")",8
7,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Broken Bow: Part I (TV Episode 2001)",What I missed about Star Trek,"Star Trek was exploration, new planets, cultures etc. All the ones that came after there was any ""unknown"" it was all politics and racism just the way we live now. Yes! And also, I loved Quantum Leap and Scott Bakula. He really makes ""Enterprise"" and I love the twist of being ""before"" the perfection of Star Trek, sometimes ""beam me up"", doesn't work! I always hate the way some people live to ""bad mouth"" anything and everyone. We see them for the small people they are.",
8,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Broken Bow: Part I (TV Episode 2001)","Enterprise ""Broken Bow"" Review Update (Ten Years Later)","After reviewing the entire first season here in 2002 following its original airing, I gave the season 7/10 and the opening pilot 7/10 with other episodes ranging from 9/10 to awful... I vowed to give second season a chance, but the reality is that I gave up as it aired and felt uninspired and moreover couple with the dismal tenth Trek movie : Nemesis (3/10) which to me was the nail in the coffin of a fine franchise. so it was R.I.P. in 2002.However, ten years later, and on the eve of Star Trek Into Darkness, although I was not extremely pleased with Star Trek (2009) (6/10), I decided to buy the entire Enterprise series to finally see what Enterprise season 2,3 and 4 were about, perhaps (but probably not!) tired of watching even excellent DS9 episodes for the umpteenth time and some mix/match of vibrant Voyager and dated TNG which I actually never finished in its entirety either.Low and behold, I was absolutely hooked seeing Broken Bow in one sitting! I loved the intrigue, the tension, the action, the dialogue and the characters. T'Pol is brilliant and beautiful. Travis and Hoshi have possibly their best episode here as I remember them being underutilized after this. Phlox is enigmatic and endearing. Trip and Archer are slightly typical bravado, but solid and softened by Archer's apt back story with his father. The both makes amends with patronizing T'Pol, Trip taking his shirt off in the decon and challenging her on the bridge. The supporting character from the Ambassadors, Admirals, Klingons, Suliban (including seductive and believable Sarin) all add to the rich tapestry.Also, the idea of the show to be early explorers is omnipresent and we are as excited as the characters to discover new civilizations and learn their peculiarities, to try new technology, etc.Add time travel and foreign worlds who give way to amazing audio and visual effects (including sci-fi elements and sexy elements) and you have a two-hour plus episode that looks like a theatrical release. It helps that it was filmed in 16:9 way before it's time. So revising this pilot I am pumped to see Enterprise again. If nothing else and the series still feel flats, at least I can now be assured that the premise and the production was promising. Rating changed from 7 to 9/10!End personal log.",9
9,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Broken Bow: Part I (TV Episode 2001)",Here we go again,"After the dismal series that was Star Trek: Voyager (with over-saturated the Star Trek universe in my honest opinion), I really REALLY wanted to believe that doing a prequel could be the most refreshing thing to happen to Star Trek. However, I was wrong. This is JUST LIKE Star Trek: Voyager - which isn't surprising given the fact that the same creators of that show are back here. What Star Trek really needs is a refresher course, like Nicholas Meyer gave after Star Trek The Motion Picture and Final Frontier. And why does the opening credits have a song instead of the traditional score of the previous series - I really don't understand this (it's a good song by Diane Warren but highly inappropriate for Star Trek). And why do they meet Klingons in this very first episode when Kirk and Company had no idea what they were in the original series - a problematic continuity error. 6 out of 10.",6

Sadly, UPN chopped this up so badly with commercials it was difficult to follow the story line. In the last hour of this two-hour movie it seemed like I was watching a repeating pattern of 5 minutes programming followed by five minutes of commercials. I understand commercials pay the bills but this was just too much. If the weekly episode follow this pattern, I'll be tuning out.",5

If you haven't had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely watch this one. Perhaps more compelling than that of Voyager's Caretaker, which launched the series with Cpt. Janeway, Archer's adventures are completely different, yet strangely familiar...The music is catchy too. No true Sci-fi fan can go without seeing at least one Star Trek episode--and these installments make the wait worthwhile.",10
12,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Broken Bow: Part I (TV Episode 2001)",A very good start,"A very good start. I was a bit surprised to find the machinery not quite so advanced: It should have been cruder, to match we saw in the original series.     The cast is interesting, although the Vulkan lady comes across as a little too human. She needs to   school on Spock who, after all, is the model for this race. Too bad they couldn't have picked Jeri Ryan.   I like Ms. Park, the Korean(?)lady. The doctor has possibilities. Haven't sorted out the other males, except for the black guy. He's a really likeable. Bakula needs to find his niche--In QL his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything. He is, of course, big and strong enough for the heroics. The heavies were OK, although I didn't like their make-up.",9

It was well done with the perfect setting and a great acting job done by all the characters. The NX-01, Enterprise is the perfect vessel to show the beginnings of what many people have come to love.Scott Bakula was just superior as Captain Jonathan Archer. Jolene Blalock gave a commanding performance as Subcommander T'Pol. That it just two people of this wonderful new crew that is boldly going to take us into the great history of Starfleet.Enterprise looks like it's going to be a good series well worth watching, and I recommend that. Watch it.",10
14,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Broken Bow: Part I (TV Episode 2001)",Fresh and new!,"This is what I was expecting when star trek DS9 premiered.  Not to slight DS9.  That was a wonderful show in it's own right, however it never really gave the fans more of what they wanted.  Enterprise is that show.  While having a similarity to the original trek it differs enough to be original in it's own ways.  It makes the ideas of exploration exciting to us again. And that was one of the primary ingredients that made the original so loved. Another ingredient to success was the relationships that evolved between the crew members.  Viewers really cared deeply for the crew.  Enterprise has much promise in this area as well.  The chemistry between Bakula and Blalock seems very promising.  While sexual tension in a show can often become a crutch, I feel the tensions on enterprise can lead to much more and say alot more than is typical.  I think when we deal with such grand scale characters of different races or species even, we get some very interesting ideas and television.  Also, we should note the performances, Blalock is very convincing as Vulcan T'pol and Bacula really has a whimsy and strength of character that delivers a great performance.  The rest of the cast delivered good performances also.  My only gripes are as follows.  The theme.  It's good it's different, but a little to light hearted for my liking.  We need something a little more grand.  Doesn't have to be orchestral.  Maybe something with a little more electronic sound would suffice.  And my one other complaint.  They sell too many adds.  They could fix this by selling less ads, or making all shows two parters.  Otherwise we'll end up seeing the shows final act getting wrapped up way too quickly as was one of my complaints of Voyager.",10

Ever since my dad got me into Star Trek, I've been watching it every day ever since, which probably explains why I love Enterprise. Every actor and actress perform on the mark (my favourite character has to be ""Trip"" for his humour and sarcasm). Trust me if you're a Trekkie you'll love this!!!",
16,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Broken Bow: Part I (TV Episode 2001)",A Great Start-,"Ok, so, this is coming a few weeks late, but it is here.  Mostly, this is because of statements of various negative natures.  Starting with the technology.  When Star Trek: TOS ran, special effect technology was extreamely low tec, and more than that, the crew had little money to do any kind of proper mock ups.  In the 35 years seince TOS premiered, the crew of Star Trek have become experts at economy.Ultimately, they have decided, quite rightly in my mind, to abandon the look of TOS and reverse engineered TNG et all.  So what if they decided not to make the transporter out of gold glitter or made the phase pistols look closer to the ones from Star Trek II?  As for the nits being picked about first contact with the Klingon Empire, it was presumed based upon comments made by Kirk and Riker that Earth only met the Klingon's in 2200.  Nothing was firmly established.Enterprise gives us the most promising venue of exploration that we've seen in a while.  This is what Voyager COULD have been.  No series can evolve without a few inconsistancies, but be thankful that Star Trek has so few. So, quit gripping and enjoy.",10
17,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Broken Bow: Part I (TV Episode 2001)",Off to a good start,"The latest Star Trek gives all hope for the future of television. In light of what has been happening in the USA the last few weeks, Trek can have a unique ability to inspire. This series tries to do that right from the start. Departing from the typical Trek opening of ships flying, they've grounded the scifi story in ideas we see around us today then finish off with their ideas of the future set to the beat of a ""I can touch the stars"" opening theme.  I was not so impressed by the story line in Broken Bow as we're never quite sure what the ""Temporal Cold War"" is all about and other loose ends. But, I think part of the idea of this series is that everything is supposed to be going by so fast for these characters that they can hardly keep up with it all. Kind of a wild carnival ride where you know you missed some things but you get off thinking ""wow, let's do that again!"" Scott Bakula has a terrific ability to bring a thoughtfull presence to the hectic environment and the script in the first episode uses him effectively. While you do get the sense that everyone is still looking for their ""space legs"" concerning their characters as everyone has superficial emotions, there was a sweetness to the Braga/Berman script and some considered moments built on well-done special effects. These are the moments that make the show seem real and allow you to feel that you can put yourself in the place of the characters and think ""maybe, some day, that could be me (God, I hope it is!)

20,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Broken Bow: Part I (TV Episode 2001)",A new hope for the Star Trek saga,"So far, new Star Trek series take a season or two to get interesting. This one promises to be interesting already. Bakula makes a great Captain. I like the oddball doctor and look forward to fascinating revelations about him. It's great that there's at least one (human) crewmember who isn't sanguine about the dangerous situations; it'll be cool to see her develop a thick skin. Not crazy about the ""babe"" factor, with Jolene Blalock in a ""cat suit"" like Seven of Nine from Voyager; it's insulting to ST and SF fans, unnecessary to get attention for a potentially great show, and very much out-of-character for Vulcans. The Suliban and their associates are extremely intriguing -- what do they want? Looking forward to seeing how Berman et al insert stories into the ST saga that tie in but don't mess up the ST universe. (Will Capt. Archer wind up leaving really weird events out of his log?

The Utopian characters of the Next Generation got tiring, they were so noble as to be unbelievable.  I also like the sub-plot that humans are bitter toward the Vulcans.  Its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs.  It makes me look forward to seeing when the humans become the dominant race between the two, though I don't think it would work in the time frame of the show.  The only negatives that jumped out at me were the ""quick cut off the ending at 2 hours"" feel of the end, which is common among many of the Trek shows.  The second was the shameless dig for ratings by a couple of senselessly sexy scenes.  It was out of place, a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pad the pre-teen audience with some skin. But its not my job to make the show profitable, so oh well.Lets see how the next episode does.",8
22,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Broken Bow: Part I (TV Episode 2001)",Episode 1 does well enough in kicking off an ST series far better than people think,"Those who knock ""Enterprise"" as nothing special at all had better remember how long ""The Next Generation"" took to get into its stride and how hammy certain dialogues and how naff certain ideas from that show made from the late 80s through to the mid-90s can now seem (and in some cases seemed even back then). In complete contrast, ""Enterprise"" really hits the ground running with a competent, real-looking, intriguing, moving episode that combines a worthwhile and fun story with all the necessary briefing and introductions we need for the scene to be set (for what would in fact go on to be 4 seasons of shows).And that scene is being set in the year 2151: and how novel and innovative it seemed from the off when ""Enterprise"" showed us how exceptional and flexible and superb a being Spock was (will be!) compared to so many of his Vulcan compatriots (from some decades before), who come over here as unpleasant, stuffy, haughty, troublesome and of course keen to do whatever they can to block human development at every turn? The basic idea is that we are already 100 years on from ""First Contact"" (a beautiful moment in the ST film of that name, but one that was then apparently followed by 100 years (!) of stalling and holding back human progress! Few sci-fi genres would be clever or pithy enough to think of that kind of unexpected scenario, so all plaudits for it!!!Captain Archer (Scott Bakula) puts his crew together for a ship that is for him cutting-edge technology and not too bad in terms of speed; but definitely underarmed and so primitive in other ways by the standards of the ST universe that we can still see in its design how we might have got to it from the spacecraft we have here in 2018 (or 2001) - something by the way that the opening title sequences also try to explain to us in a series of touching and moving scenes that include ""HMS Enterprize"" (Royal Navy 1705-1707)).This is all really invigorating and I must say that, watching the episode, one really does get an inkling of humanity's prospects writ large above the first tentative steps into the cosmos it is taking. Just because we know nothing and can do almost nothing (nothing at all without Vulcan T'Pol aboard to let slip a hint of what she knows), does not mean we are not proud of ourselves and able to hold up our morality and achievements boldly enough against those on display among the best and worst of the sentient beings ""out there"".At first glance T'Pol seems dry as dust in the first episode, but Jolene Blalock brings, not only sexiness to the role, but also hints from the very outset of the dry humour, occasionally inappropriate remarks, ""fish-out-of-water-ness"" but basic kindness that the character is able to develop as the series progress. And here in this episode there is a wonderful, well-acted moment when it first becomes clear that she is prepared to show loyalty to Captain and crew (not just her own species), and Archer and Trip (Connor Trinneer) present their first hint of admiration so very convincingly. It's acting of a high order.The other alien on the crew - John Billingsley's Dr Phlox - is another character who makes a presence felt right from the off. He's experienced, kindly, avuncular and with a few rather offputting habits! How innovative is that!? Somehow we again feel we are learning how to be tolerant and embrace the different just as the crew of NX-01 are doing.Hence a gritty, realistic, low-techish ambience that is very easy - and rewarding - to relate to for the viewer, and all the more so in the company of characters that mostly look competent, realistic and well-rounded from the outset, in what is a far cry indeed from the situation with TNG or Voyager (though perhaps DS9 did better on that front). And where Hoshi (Linda Park) gives the impression she won't be able to fit in on this mission ... well that's also realistic in the opposite sense, and seems quite natural enough and capable of evoking our sympathy.There are - I know for a fact - some Trek fans who have never even given ""Enterprise"" a try.

This, mixed with the heavy-handed slug metaphor used to represent Hoshi's situation makes for an all too forgettable episode.Captain Archer seems to act very similar to Captain Kirk thus far: Emotional, inquisitive, and has a bit of a temper. The rest of the crew seems solid, although we don't know much about Reed thus far and I'm interested to know a little more about his backstory. Dr. Phlox is my favorite character through the first few episodes: witty, optimistic, with a child-like curiosity.Hopefully this is the last episode centered around Hoshi's insecurities.

At every turn, she's annoying the audience with her stupid fears. One minute she's afraid she'll be space sick, another she's upset her cabin faces the wrong direction, another she's worried about going into a confined space and another she's worried about her linguistic skills during a first contact. I felt like yelling 'man up' or something like it during so much of the show. On a planet with billions of people, couldn't they have come up with someone more qualified, less stupid and more capable than this mess of a woman?! Plus, I am sure a lot of women cringed to see such a weak female leading character and she's nothing like any of the much more capable and less annoying guys!The purpose of the episode is to show Hoshi evolving very quickly (and a bit TOO quickly) to become more confident on the ship.

The audience has come to this series with the knowledge of the ""Prime Directive"" but ENT shows human infantcy into space exploration. While I agree that Archer and his human crew show their ignorance more times than not, this is how humans learn. We are naturally curious and exert our beliefs and ideals (albiet with no intention of harm) on other cultures because thats all we know. its like letting a child make mistakes to learn from them. when that happens as adults, sometimes ppl get hurt. T'pal does a good job at trying to direct the crew in the Volcan direction and to learm from their techniques but ultimately, she comes to realize humans dont learn well that way.The beauty of the planet is enticing. For hours, theres nothing about their exploration that leads them to believe something could go wrong. The sensors on the enterprise are advanced for that time but not enough for every unknown particle that could be encountered. Some species may never have a problem on the planet, some (like humans) can have extreme reations. luckily, no one dies.after the experience, the enterprise logs can warn any other humans that may encounter the planet. the crew has to form their own path through the galaxy. that knowledge is what leads them to the prime directive. they learn that even the Volcans arent perfect and their ""logic"" isnt always the best idea for every species and culture.",9

The Xyrillians are a fun, peaceful new race with great technology. I was a little confused as to why they needed Trip to fix their ship, even though they are far more technologically advanced than the humans, but no matter.

Here is a neat detail--he could not just beam over or even go directly aboard by shuttle.

In the very beginning, when Archer is having a bath and there is a problem with the gravitational system is hilarious. The idea of the pregnancy and the intriguing sexual encounter is very original and also very funny.

A colony, lost in space & time, separated from Earth and forced to fend for itself for a 75 year span. The beginning had me very excited to see what was in store. Unfortunately, this script quickly stalled and finished as a lackluster episode at best. The ending left a lot to be desired but I hope we see these Novans occasionally in the future. At it's core, I like the idea of Novans being out there. However, now that they have accepted that they are humans and are okay with Earth's assistance, their novelty may wear off quickly.I disagree with those that argue that 75 years is not a long enough time period for the Novans to disassociate themselves from the humans. 75 years is 3 generations. We know that only the children survived. We know that these children heard their parents tell tales of how the Earthlings are bad and are out to get the Novans. After the meteor crashed and wiped out the adults, do you think these young Novans would want to identify themselves as this terrible species that just killed their parents? If the incident didn't cause repressed memories, then these children definitely buried this knowledge deep and refused to tell their own children about the fact that Novans are indeed humans. They most likely told ghost stories of these terrible humans to their kids, ignoring the fact that they are all humans themselves. Receiving this doctrine for years, the new generations could easily despise humans with all their might and refuse to look at evidence and admit to themselves that they are indeed humans.The end of this episode, the old ""see? we are all alike"" trope as the two leaders work together didn't do much for me.

1,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Terra Nova (TV Episode 2001)",not bad but a little light on ideas,"Probably not the best episode, but still OK. I've just got to write something here to supplement the other review written here. Terra Nova (New Earth) is the first class M (earth like) planet discovered by humans within twenty light years of earth. Which is apparently the greatest distance that could be practically reached with the pre-warp 5 engines. Even so, a one way trip to the planet with the old drive takes nine years. The colonists were therefore pretty well making a one way trip, especially as they planned to dismantle their starship: the Conestoga for materials to build the colony. Now here's where I see a bit of a problem. Once the colonists report back that things are going well Earth wants to send still more colonists. The Novans strongly object to this; not wanting to share they're new home. Why? It's a planet for heavens sake! Another colony site, or half a dozen, could be placed on it thousands of kilometers away. People their grandchildren need never see if they don't want too. Anyway, these people must've been inordinately paranoid. When the colony suffers a disaster (radioactive contamination of unknown source) the colonists immediately assume that the event is an attack by earth in retaliation for their recalcitrance. This leads the survivors, almost all children, to retreat underground. The children come to the conclusion that they are not human and that humans are responsible for the destruction of their home. Making humans the enemy. There is no indication that they are mutant BTW, just odd face paint and haircuts that might lead one to believe that they are an alien species at first glance. Captain Archer must somehow cut through their entrenched paranoia and convince them to relocate as Phlox discovers that radioactive elements have begun to leech into the local groundwater. The contamination will eventually accumulate to lethal levels. At first Archer considers relocating the Novans by force; Starfleet has stun weapons :). For subsequent relocation to Earth, a culture that the Novans are totally unprepared for. Finally a better solution becomes clear; not all parts of the planet were contaminated. The Novans need not leave their home to be safe.",7

It turns out that the colony was practically wiped out and what remained went underground. So far, this all was interesting and had the makings of a cool episode. Unfortunately, what follows seemed kind of dumb and didn't make a lot of sense. It turns out that the descendants of the colonists are amazingly stupid. They THINK that they aren't human and they think humans caused their catastrophe and since then they created some weird primitive tribal society. The problem is that they are also very suspicious and have taken one of the crew prisoner. What's next?My problem is that to see a group of reasonable and intelligent colonists creating a new generation of folks who VERY quickly forgot they were human and created such a complex alien society made little sense. 73 years and this?

The blue-skinned captors demand to know where a theoretical surveillance device is hidden. Archer, whose first meeting the Andorians is here, truthfully claims to be unaware of such a device. The Andorian leader warns Enterprise that if they attempt a rescue mission then then will kill the hostages. One of the Vulcans leads Trip through secret catacombs to an old transmitter. Trip gets it operational and contacts Enterprise. Reed comes down with a team and attacks the Andorians using a secret passage in the catacombs. A firefight ensues, leading Archer to find a secret vault, leading to a large chamber housing a surveillance device. Archer allows the Andorians to leave with a scan of the chamber, whose existence is in violation of a treaty.Not a bad episode at all. A blend of mystery, action and drama, it does have a few problems. First, the coincidental visit of the Enterprise to the monastery was a bit contrived. Second, it was incredulous that the door to the chamber at the end was not locked with some kind of security code. It was also odd how Shran referred to his hostages as hostages; from his perspective, it would have been more strategic to have called them prisoners. While the Vulcans were apparently in violation of a treaty, it would have been in bad form for Archer to allow Shran to leave without some kind of penance for his own actions, which were also clearly out of place.I liked the twist at the end with the young monk deciding to fight the Andorians, only to have his true intentions revealed as wanting to protect the secret surveillance equipment. The exchange between Archer and T'Pol while under the blanket was excellent.",7
4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" The Andorian Incident (TV Episode 2001)",I love this episode,"One of the best aspects of ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" was its way it portrayed the Vulcans. Up until this series, they were shown as extremely honorable but dull. However, through the course of this newest series, you learn that they are a lot more complex...and a lot more duplicitous. This episode brings all this to a head...and in a very interesting and exciting way. It's the best episode of the series so far.When the show begins, the Enterprise nears a Vulcan monastery, P'Jem. Archer suggests they visit but T'Pol isn't so sure, as she appears to think the humans are so crude and stupid that they'll be like a group of drunk hillbillies crashing a posh society wedding! Regardless, they DO land and find the welcome a bit strange and underwhelming. Where are all the Vulcan monks? They only see one and some other things seem weird as well...when suddenly a group of Andorians pop out and take them prisoner. What apparently has happened is that the Andorians don't like or trust the nice-guy Vulcans and they've landed to inspect this monastery. The paranoid Andorians think that the place is actually a ring of spies who are eavesdropping on them. While the Andorians come off like angry jerks most of the show, by the end it turns out that there is a bit to what they suspect....well, more than just a bit.This episode not only sheds further light on the dark side of the Vulcans but it re-introduces the Andorians who were briefly seen in the original series. Now, in ""Star Trek: Enterprise"", they'll be a very important part of the series, as will their leader Commander Shran. If he seems familiar, it's played by the same actor who played the incredibly nasty Weyoun on ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"".

5,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" The Andorian Incident (TV Episode 2001)",The Best Yet,"The other reviews hit the nail on the head: best episode of the series thus far.The introduction of the Andorians and their complicated relationship with the Vulcans is all laid out quite nicely in this episode. I love how this show is trying to make the Vulcans a more complex race than you typically see them. The first few episodes, the humans typically bad-mouthed the Vulcans and it all seemed a bit discriminatory. Now we are presented with this evidence of the Vulcans' double-dealing, causing viewers to question their true intentions. These Vulcans preach pacifism, but is it all for show? I look forward to more adventures involving these two races.I also enjoy the character of T'Pol more and more each time. She seems to be questioning the values of her upbringing more and more with each episode. The blanket scene was a nice touch, showing us that her grudging acceptance of humans may be turning into a bit of camaraderie as she accepts Archer's sign of goodwill. The big reveal at the end of the episode seemed to have hit her fairly hard as far as Vulcans go. We'll see how that affects her moving forward.The twist at the end is great. Often times in these Star Trek episodes (as well as in a lot of shows & movies), we watch as the good guys battle the bad guys; everything's laid out in black & white. Here however, we see the episode turned on its head in the last instance, leaving the viewer questioning his/her understanding of the relationship on-screen. Typically, we only see these interactions from the perspective of the Enterprise crew. Maybe these episodes have more gray area than we assume.T'Pol says the Andorians are scared of the Vulcans because of their superior technology and intellect, that Andorians are extremely volatile and untrustworthy towards Vulcans. Maybe they have a reason to be?",10

That which he finds startling and exciting causes the Vulcans to turn up their noses. Earth creatures are like ants to them. It may be that because their race was once violent and lacking in calm, they find the earthlings to be quite without merit. In this one, an enormous comet is discovered and Archer sends two crew members to do a little mining of an interesting ore found on this floating piece of ice. The Vulcans seem to be overseeing their every move. Why do they do this if the humans are so insignificant. T'Pol has a problem that she must solve.

3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Breaking the Ice (TV Episode 2001)",Physics be damned!,"The one thing that always annoyed me with the Star Trek series is the liberties they take with the laws of physics. This episode had me shaking my head with amazement that I felt the need to review something I wouldn't normally take the time to do. Sometimes you suspend your believe system to allow for such things as a properly functioning warp drive, time travel where deemed unavoidable, sound in a vacuum, etc. You want to participate in the fun. In this instance two of the crew are deployed onto a comet with a diameter of about 82 kilometers or so. They went to all of the trouble, for once, to position a nearby star in order for the comet to have a tail - the star is referred to as the 'sun' for some reason though I don't believe they intended THE Sun, and plotted a position of the slowly rotating comet for the shuttle to land to avoid 'the sun'. But then when the crew land they are almost instantly confronted with a very Earth-like gravity field very much not in line with what a comet of that size would have -- which should be virtually none. OK, so let's chalk it up to gravity boots? Somehow they manage to build a snowman!? Hmm. OK...let it slide. But then on the way back to the ship one of the crew falls into a hole with much the same force as if influenced by normal Earth gravity? He hurts his leg and needs to be carried back to the ship and yet his apparent weight causes the going to be slow. Literally, he should weigh next to nothing here. Later, the ship falls into a hole as well with the same 1g results. Very hard. Very abrupt. Sorry, folks. This fails the physics test even if you struggle to construct an assumptive work-around in your head. Even the mining explosion makes a huge noise - which they even warn about prior to the explosion. I notice I neglected to review the actual episode here however. Very well. It was mundane. Nothing special here. I have never watched the Enterprise series previously but noticed it did not have a long stay on the network. So far into the series, for myself, no episode has been memorable - but this one takes the cake to bend the universal laws of common physics in order to establish a story for the fragile blossoming of the human/Vulcan relationship. There were more plausible ways to do it.",5
4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Breaking the Ice (TV Episode 2001)","I would like some dessert, please.","In the episode 'Breaking the Ice', Enterprise explores a comet. Two crewmen get trapped on the comet and have to be rescued by a Vulcan ship. That's all that happens. And yet this is such a well-filmed episode, the hour -er 38 minutes passes by very quickly. The story is told with symbolism, especially at the very beginning, and then again at the end. The camera itself tells the story.While Enterprise is exploring the comet, a Vulcan ship approaches. Captain Archer puts the Vulcans on-screen and asks what they're doing. Captain Jonathan Archer resents Vulcans, these advanced first aliens we meet, thinking humanity is being held back by them. Their visit can't be a coincidence. . . The Vulcan captain replies saying they're not much interested in the comet. ""We're more interested in watching you"", he says. He boldly admits they are spying on Enterprise. He repeats this again. Archer is calmer about it than you'd expect he'd.The two crewmen on the comet, Ensign Mayweather and Lt. Reed, run into a dangerous situation on the comet and need to be rescued. Commander Tucker and Sub-Commander T'Pol, suggest they ask the Vulcan ship for help. Archer insists Enterprise doesn't need help. But T'Pol speaks up, ""Vulcan's see humans as arrogant and prideful, asking for help would be a sign of maturity"". Here, I thought to myself, 'OK, Archer is going to correct himself and see the error of his ways'. Instead, T'Pol continues. She does what probably so many of us have wanted to do at one time or another, with a boss or co-worker, or, if we could somehow be on the bridge, she more or less takes control of Enterprise. She continues to explain why it would be best to ask the Vulcan ship for help as the crew obey her commands. Captain Archer remains silent and the crewmen are rescued. It turns out they probably would have died if Enterprise had tried the rescue without help.When the Vulcan captain says good-bye to Enterprise, you can see the same Vulcan captain, with the same expressions, in a whole new light.In 'Breaking the Ice', besides crew members coming to danger, the Vulcan science officer aboard Enterprise, T'Pol, has a personal problem. T'Pol's 'boyfriend' makes it known, thru contact with the other ship, that he'd like her to return to Vulcan. She's not sure what to do. 'Trip' (Commander Tucker) tells her not to follow logic. Do what you want to do.In the ships galley, Trip encourages T'Pol to have a taste of pie from earth. She declines, as far as we can see. She does decide to stay on Enterprise. In the last scene, you can see a crewman in the dark standing before a desk in their quarters. It could be T'Pol, but it's hard to make out for sure. On the desk in front of them, you can clearly see a saucer of pie. Then the screen fades.T'Pol of course ends up having an affair with Trip, and not, thank goodness, with the highest ranking guy around, Captain Archer. Archer and T'Pol had been put together quite often beforehand and it looked like it would be Archer if some kind of an affair was going to take place.By the end of the series T'Pol isn't really acting much like a Vulcan. Instead of being emotionless, she usually has a basket full of emotions hidden barely beneath the surface. In one of the unintentionally funny lines of the series, when T'Pol is back on Vulcan visiting her mother her mom says, ""Your emotions always were close to the surface"". No kidding! Speaking of good lines in a bad place. . . In 'The Augments', three episodes after the Xindi-threat ended, after 30 episodes, and Earth coming one hair-width from being completely destroyed (in a couple of time-lines it was destroyed), after all that, Daniels, the crewman who visits Archer from the future, tells him, ""If the Klingons retaliate against Earth, that'll make the Xindi incident look like a lover's quarrel"". Even my roomie, whose not a Star Trek fan, rolled their eyes at that one.I could be wrong but these 'emotions' T'Pol shows may have begun in season three with the episode 'Impulse'. The one where Enterprise finds a Vulcan ship whose crew have been overcome by Trellium D poisoning. T'Pol is also affected. She acts confused. It's hard to say exactly what emotions she's going thru in the episode but they are there close to the surface. They may have liked this effect and decided to continue using it some later in the series. It's hard to say exactly what she's feeling. They may have even put her in some kind of cold storage unit on the set or something, before some of the scenes. Some technique, to get this effect. You never see her shiver though. She trembles. Probably the actress who plays T'Pol is extremely accomplished.Something about her did fit perfectly into the Star Trek franchise. She certainly made a fine first officer for the first mission of Enterprise.",8

However, the Captain is surprised to see a Vulcan ship nearby that just seems to be watching them. Captain Vanik says he's not spying on them, but it sure looks like he is--especially because the Vulcans ALWAYS seem to be doing that! At the same time, a coded letter than T'Pol sends makes some of the crew wonder where her loyalties lie.This episode just reinforces how sneaky and distrustful the Vulcans are on this series--a major plus for ""Star Trek: Enterprise"". In the other Trek shows, they are dull and ultra-nice--so it's a nice chance to once again see how duplicitous and nasty they were when they first began interacting with the smelly and stupid humans.",7
6,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Breaking the Ice (TV Episode 2001)",Boring But Important Episode,"While it's true that not a lot goes on in this episode (the exploration of the Eisillium comet named Archer's Comet seems relatively pointless to the overall show), this episode is important for the sake of character development for members of the crew.T'Pol's casting aside of traditional Vulcan customs is an important milestone in her character arc. In the past few episodes, we've seen T'Pol begin to accept human customs more and she's had reason to doubt her Vulcan brethren (see Andorian Incident). Her trust in Trip may be foreshadowing a future more intimate relationship between the two (this is just a guess from me, I have 0 knowledge of the show coming into this). I see more foreshadowing in the omnipresence of the Vulcans wherever the Enterprise seems to go. Captain Archer is taking exception to the fact that the Vulcans are hovering over the humans, keeping a close eye on them. The Vulcans don't seem to trust the humans due to their volatility and emotion. The two races may come to a crossroads at some point but, so far, this doesn't seem eminent. There is a certain tension between the two, however. Travis & Reed screwing around in the snow didn't really add any excitement to the episode. Travis seems to have a childlike wonder and maturity. Exploring for him is similar to a kid in a candy store. I'm still not sure what to make of Reed and would enjoy a Reed- centered episode to give him a bit more background.Final Thought: The scene involving sending a message to Earth kids and answering their fan mail was some of the most unnecessary filler I've seen in a while. Besides learning the name of the Doctor's home planet, that scene accomplished absolutely nothing.This was a stale episode but it did accomplish something so I can't complain too much.",6

Fortunate for them that they did decide to go check out what the Akaali are up to since they find something fishy going on.The Vulcan/human relationship is still a bit odd to me. The humans complain that the Vulcans look over their shoulder a bit too much but, at the end of the episode, we're told that Archer informs the Vulcans of this planet and asks them to check in on it from time to time to see how they are doing. This extends the reach of the Vulcan's oversight even further. Knowing earthlings, realistically, we'd probably want to keep the knowledge of this planet to ourselves and in the future treat it as one of our colonies & extract its precious resources for our material use. But hey, maybe we'll mature in the next 100 years. This episode's fairly average. Seeing Archer encounter some alien romance is fun, I suppose. It's also nice encountering 2 new races but it's doubtful that we run across the Akaali again anytime soon. I like the character of Riaan, too bad she couldn't come aboard the Enterprise. Noting special about this episode, but not terrible. It also has a sweet stratagem executed by T'Pol.Side Note: Archer tells Riaan that he often talks to his dog when he's thinking critically.

Also fortunate is that the ship DID investigate, as they soon are shocked to find that some other advanced species is on the planet in disguise also--and these beings are NOT particularly nice and don't mind if they kill a few of the Akaali in the process.

Not only is she physically attractive; she is extremely wise. She also handles their abilities and actions without batting an eye.

Overall, a rather interesting but not particularly outstanding episode.*The Nausicaans was a name that was familiar but I didn't at first realize which episodes involved them.

Chaos and moralizing ensues.This episode was Travis-centered. Each main cast member seems to be getting their own character development episode in season 1 as we get to know the crew of the Enterprise (Fight or Flight for Hoshi, Unexpected for Trip, Breaking the Ice for T'Pol, etc.). Travis identifies with the ship and its crew, being a Boomer himself. Travis must cope with his personal remorse over leaving the freight he called home to join Star Fleet. He left behind his family and friends for a new life and must deal with the emotions that come with that. As the Enterprise learns of a Nausicaan hostage aboard the freighter, it's up to the Enterprise to figure out the best route to take.The moralization of this episode just comes across as too heavy- handed. The characters practically spell it out for you in strangely worded monologues. It also doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Archer tries to construe these pirates as human beings who deserve the same treatment as the crew of the freighter. The problem with this is simple: THEY ARE PIRATES! They live outside the law and clearly don't deserve equal treatment as the shipping crew. Archer tells the Nausicaan captain that humans will soon have powerful ships all over space that will blow them out of the sky so they better behave. The Nausicaans back off... and that's it. No reprimanding for all the past instances of theft and destruction? Okay.This episode brings light to a real problem with space exploration. Lack of supervision and law. Early on in the Earth's foray into the great unknown, space still has a bit of a Wild West feel. The Vulcans keep an eye on things but they don't like to get their hands too dirty. This may foreshadow a future involving more oversight for races with space capabilities. The obvious and flawed moralization, mixed in with some bad acting from Officer Ryan, makes for a poor episode. Probably the worst from the series so far.",4
3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Fortunate Son (TV Episode 2001)","serial mad-men, would be suicide bombers, and the various other malcontents with a mission. . .","Enterprise comes across the Fortunate, a freighter whose captain's been injured by Nausicaan pirates. Dr Phlox works on him in sick bay while their First Officer, Mathew Ryan, assumes command of the Fortunate. Much of the story is told from the perspective of the freighter.We follow Ryan and his loyal, working class, cargo crew as they maneuver to hunt down the Nausicaans, making the shipping lanes safe for cargo crews. With Ryan taking command, it's like, just an average guy, gets to undertake an important space mission. Fortunate's command chair looks really cool. Fortunate looks good. It's fitted with phase cannons, dumps it's empty cargo pod, and zooms off in search of Nausicaans. This episode was a lot of fun for me. I found myself talking back to the screen. It was a bit like 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' here at the house (a show where characters talk back to the television). It was a lot of fun. I suspect the actor playing Mathew Ryan read for the part of Captain Archer. For some reason I found myself waiting to see what the moral message would be. The crew have a Nausicaan prisoner on board, and actually torture him, certainly not a good thing, but I was waiting to see if their decision to go after the Nausicaans is right or not. Nausicaans featured in a Next Generation episode. In an episode of season six, 'Tapestry', the all powerful alien being 'Q' lets Picard change his past. One regret Picard's had is that years ago as a young crewman he got into a brawl with a Nausicaan. He was nearly killed when the Nausicaan stabs him. Q lets Picard change things. This time Picard keeps a cooler head. As he continues on the ship he's assigned to, Picard is never considered for promotion. He realizes, if this fight hadn't effected him, he never would have risen in the ranks of Star Fleet. In a moment of defeat, and surprising candor, Picard says to Q, 'take me back'.Nausicaans are a wild bunch and here they make their way as pirates. When the Fortunate meets up with them a space battle ensues. It turns out, First Officer Ryan doesn't have the Nausicaan's shield frequencies after all - the ace he's been counting on. Our freighter is on the losing end of a battle with two or three Nausicaan ships. The message seems to be, they simply didn't bring enough firepower. Enterprise tracks down the pirates, too, and just in time, making it two ships versus three. At this point it's a standoff. Enterprise has an advantage but doesn't seem to want to press it's luck. Archer is trying to remain neutral perhaps. Enterprise can't stay and patrol this area of space. When Enterprise asks Ryan to return the captured Nausicaan and put an end to the fight, Ryan refuses. He won't give up.At this point Enterprises' navigator, Travis Mayweather, himself a former cargo crewman, speaks to Ryan, to talk him down from this desperate act. But is he really talking to just Ryan, or perhaps also to other would-be captains out there? Other men on a mission. Other desperadoes. The serial mad-men, would be suicide bombers, and the various other malcontents of the world? Why is Ryan doing this. . .? ""This isn't about those other cargo ships"", Mayweather says. ""It's not about them at all"". ""It's about, you"".It's about revenge, Mayweather implies. Finally, Ryan gives in. It's over. The parties are parted, the real captain is returned to Fortunate, and Enterprise departs. At the end Archer contacts the real captain. Don't be too tough on Ryan, Archer says, ""His heart was in the right place"". To be captain for a day. . . 'Fortunate Son' turns out to be almost a precursor to season three. Intentional or not, this episode is almost a microcosm of the Xindi-threat, where Archer is forced to use torture and space piracy, any and everything, in an effort to try and save Earth from the Xindi weapon.Those darn Xindi",7
4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Fortunate Son (TV Episode 2001)",rough episode,"SciFi, and Star Trek in particular, has a long history of social commentary. Usually I tend to agree with the general outlook of the show, which isn't really surprising since, with it being broadcast TV, the network would have insisted that the plots not be so controversial that they couldn't sell ad space for cheeseburgers and Pepsi and whatnot when it aired. But this episode seemed a little anachronistic to me in that I really did not agree with the perspective of the writers here.The basic plot: space-based human colonies that make a living as long, LONG haul truckers (nicknamed ""boomers"") trigger an SOS and the Enterprise is sent to investigate, but finds that the boomers don't really want their help after all. It becomes clear pretty quickly that the boomer's culture is analogous to rural culture, making the Enterprise crew the urban perspective and the episode really about that culture clash. The boomers don't really care for the Federation, which they see as drawing their best and brightest away from their society. They eschew newer, faster drives that complete typical routes between planetary colonies in 6 months for drives that, if you do the math based upon the stated speeds, take an insane 25 years because ""any faster, and there'd be no time to enjoy the trip."" They also vocally value their independence from any governmental over site, setting them up for conflict with the Enterprise even though they are all technically from the same society.These characterizations are all pretty much lifted from discussions about rural America at the time. The brain drain of youth moving out of struggling farming communities, valuing the slower-pace-of-life idea that goes back to at least the late 50's, early 60's on shows like Andy Griffith, and the anti-fed sentiment that was perceived in rural areas by urban populations in the wake of Waco and the like.Just as a side note though, I have no idea how that slower trip thing works economically if ships capable of making the trip in 6 months exist; it would be like setting out from China in 1993 for the US and looking forward to your big payday when you arrive in 2018 with your load of Beanie Babies and Pentium 1 processors.Anyway, the central tension in the episode revolves around the boomer's interactions with a not very sympathetic race that basically makes a living as violent bandits, killing and plundering wherever they encounter vulnerable boomers. The boomers have decided to respond in kind, but captain Archer steps in with a pretty self-righteous speech about finding a diplomatic solution, representing humanity, etc. When the boomers point out he has no jurisdiction there he strong-arms them by threatening to dismantle and remove all of the repairs/parts given to the boomers to keep them alive. He then proceeds to enforce his view of right and wrong with his superior power and hand-waves away their safety concerns by announcing that the Enterprise will guard them until the aliens go away, even after they point out that the real threat is what happens after he leaves.I think what happened here is that the aliens were originally meant to be analogous to illegal immigrants or something like that. Maybe they planned to soften the aliens by explaining that it wasn't all of the species that was like this or something, but changes were made and the idea got lost. Total guess, but it would explain Archer's actions a little better. As it is, I'm kind of amazed there wasn't a scene where he was recalled to earth to find an angry mob who saw him as siding with murderous aliens over humans. Then again, this is a society that took billions (or even trillions) in resources and time to build a ship and then just gave it to some guy with the instructions ""you get out there and go exploring, buddy!""In the end they fail to really resolve the central tension, instead turning the acting leader into a would-be murderer of the Enterprise crew himself, then dismiss it all by having the original leader wake up from his coma and declare that he agrees with Archer. It feels cheap, lazy, and forced. Not one of the better episodes.",5

We're supposed to cower and pretend being raided and pillaged is totally normal until we're at the point where we have so much superior weaponry that we don't really need to press the fire button.I was really waiting for someone to start talking about 17th century battlefield honor codes, or something equally preposterous. (For instance, guerrilla fighting is without honor, but standing in a line to be mowed down like automatons to the sound of insipid drum and flute music is courageous and smart.) That's really what Archer's position is about. It's about pretending a situation is something else entirely in order to prove a point to someone who won't be alive once the pillaging (or zombie-like advancing of the lines) is over.The muddled moralizing of this episode fails also because the threadbare attempt to resurrect the Wrath of Khan (the strong leader with big pecs who puts revenge ahead of his ship and comrades) doesn't convince. It's changing the subject, since the bulk of the build-up is about protecting the crew from a real threat. The pecs of Khan-lite are also pretty much the only highlight of this episode.Archer is his typical Sesame Street self, spelling out everything in big capital letters in order to bore everyone. Even when the Enterprise is in the middle of a firing battle involving five ships it's hard for the cast to not yawn during the insipid speechifying done by whoever the guy is who was once a freighter child. Even Archer acted bored when he gave the firing orders, the results of which we didn't even see (as we know the outcome will be Archer's success at demonstrating yet again the beautiful cornfed morality of the American midwest).But, the episode has plenty of predictable phaser battling amid obstacles that's supposed to be action (complete with goofy background ""music"") — just like the previous one and probably the one before that. It's also amusing that the humans can't seem to hit a huge Nausicaan standing in the middle of a corridor.There are so many things wrong with the way the prisoner is handled, with the way the Enterprise bridge crew are captured... it would take pages to go into. I suppose the writing could be said to not be totally predictable, just predictably wacky. The bad moralization, though, is eternally predictable, as is the poor acting — complete with manic hand gestures during the worst scene in the episode (the one mentioned earlier where a speech trumps a dull firefight).I do have to say, though, that the way the Nausicaans completely transformed from killer pillagers to humans with nasty-looking masks, in order to make the moralizing work at the end of the episode, was quite a sight. It makes deux ex machina seem credible.It's amusing that Berman thought having gay people in Trek would be a bad thing for the series and then released shlock like this. This is one gay person who would have done a heck of a lot better. As someone who was a target of bullying, I could have told him that, indeed, the best defense is a good offense. You do punch back, as hard as possible and right at the face. That's the language bullies understand. If you're going to make Nausicaans, cloaking them in all of the garb of the Star Trek speed bump... then be serious, eh?",2

Not surprisingly, one is a Suliban in disguise. What IS surprising is that a crew member comes to Archer to tell him he's not really a part of the crew but a time cop!!

When they decide to return to Earth because of a superior enemy, Trip pulls out the stops to improve the weapons on the ship and the crew pull together and eventually improve the ship's defences to such a level that a return home is unnecessary.

All they have are fairly wimpy, non-photon torpedoes. The NX-01 left space dock without installing the 3 phase cannons it was supposed to have. As a matter of fact, they only have the parts to build one. Not good. Actually, that is exactly what IS good about the episode. We get to see the birth of, and the first successful use of Phasers' on any ship called Enterprise. I really enjoyed the enemy ship basically having their way with the NX- 01, including boarding the ship with impunity; but in the end a power surge during a preliminary test firing (that almost took out most of the ship) is routed into hull plating (early shields)and the phasers' knock out the enemies shields with the first blast. As they move off, Enterprise fires a rear torpedo and disables the enemy ship, forcing it to disengage and limp away. With the ship now better armed, they continue on their journey, now with a bit more confidence. Great! This is what Star Trek (and life) is all about. Giving 110% to achieve your goals.",9

4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Silent Enemy (TV Episode 2002)",Somewhat silly.,"I think this episode was for the most part decent. The side plot with Lieutenant Reed was a bit silly but good for character development which is always necessary if a show is to become truly good in my opinion.The 'silent enemy' plot was quite intriguing at first as they showed up twice and just seemed to be observing the Enterprise. Archer tried talking to them both times but received no response. The third time they showed up they basically beat up on the Enterprise quite easily and then boarded it. Apparently two crewmen were knocked out and were being scanned 'quite invasively' when they were interrupted by security teams.Next we get the plot development of the vaunted Phase Cannons and they end up getting used in the final battle scene. The silly part referenced above by me has to do with why the aliens did not simply fire a few times to disable Enterprise instead of letting them fire the phase cannons not once but twice! Somewhat baffling to me. Overall a decent episode, though, and if one wants to pick at a show most of the time they will be able to do so!",6

Some quick thinking by Reed & Trip saves the day but this should be a lesson to Archer to be a bit more cautious when approaching UFOs.It was finally Reed's turn for a character development episode and, boy was I disappointed! I've been looking forward to his turn because he's slowly became one of my favorite crew members, behind Dr. Phlox & T'Pol, but this subplot was an eye-roller. Favorite food? Really? That's the best we can come up with? Half this episode is about Hoshi being either socially awkward or entirely unhelpful.

When they are once again attacked with no provocation (a common theme in the earlier shows), he is mad because they are so defenseless. So, unfortunately, he plans to return to their home and get a refit. At the same time, Malcolm and Trip work on the systems to try to see if they can create better and stronger weapons.

However, I would argue that the point is that these concepts should be explored. That the answers are not clear cut and that challenging one's established ideas is good.

1,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Dear Doctor (TV Episode 2002)",Hooray for genocide!,"""Dear Doctor"" is one of those episodes that act as proof that ""Threshold"" from Star Trek Voyager was no fluke; Berman and Braga know less about evolution than the average high school student.It takes a long time to develop into the main plot, but ultimately the resolution of the plot completely undermines what is set up in the process.The ""process"" I refer to is a series of narration voice-overs of Dr Phlox writing to a human doctor friend, telling about his experiences among humans, and with us getting insight into just how alien Phlox is---he cannot comprehend why humans would cry when watching a movie with fictional characters, for example.Then the Enterprise comes across a bunch of alien astronauts who are sick, and have no warp technology. They came across two other aliens with warp technology (including FERENGI~!) who didn't help them, so they need help now.This species has a sickness that is killing MILLIONS of them every few years. They also have another species like them (think Neanderthal to our Cro Magnon) that is less intelligent living with them. Contrary to the story of us, they've managed to live in peace with this inferior sentient species, and they care for them like a caretaker, giving them food and medicine and shelter and the like.You could argue this is an imposition of ignorance; slavery with a smile; caring for an entire species so they cannot learn to care for themselves, and this IS a valid argument which is even addressed by the human crew members involved in helping them! Dr Phlox manages, as the token alien, to step outside of the human realm of ideals and points out that this is just how their culture works, and it's a marvel that the higher-class species has not simply wiped out the lower-class one in the previous millennia.And discussing this issue WOULD have made for a spectacular Star Trek: The Next Generation episode. It would have made for an average Enterprise episode.But that's not what the episode is about.Instead, we get yet another ""swing and a miss"" bit of evolutionary understanding, where the writers state that these intelligent creatures are dying of a disease that has been EVOLVING within their entire race for THOUSANDS of years.EVOLUTION DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY! Evolution is not a wonky magic fuxit-button that lets you sprout wings or grow a cool tail over generations, ""Spore""-style. Evolution is the changes a species undergoes over many generations in order to best adapt to its environment.Evolution does NOT make moral distinctions, nor does it affect the well-being of ONE species in order to affect another. It's not some mystical, sentient force or life spirit; it's the collective result of a species becoming better suited to SURVIVE in its environment.The idiocy that is the Enterprise writers make it so that the magic pie from the 47th dimension called Evolution is causing an ENTIRE SPECIES TO DIE OUT so that a LESS FIT species can prosper. This is exactly NOT what ""Survival of the fittest"" means, and exactly NOT how Evolution works.What makes the absurd into the audacious, even offensive, is that Dr Phlox realizes this, and says THEY SHOULDN'T INTERFERE! Before you can bring up the ""playing God"" discussion, Captain Archer goes over it with Phlox, with Archer arguing that DOCTOR Phlox is a DOCTOR, and thus he is morally and ethically obligated, as well as employed, to NOT HARM life, but to help save lives.Phlox has the GALL to compare it with humanity and Neanderthals, asking what if aliens came and helped Neanderthals to survive instead of us, Cro Magnon? If that were the case, it would be Neanderthal descendants crewing the Enterprise.This is also a horribly flawed argument given that Evolution clearly favored US, the STRONGER species; we were physically better adapted to more environments, even if we weren't as strong as them, and we were more INTELLIGENT than them. The Neanderthals were not killed off by us (though we did help); they died because they could not compete with us in the acquisition of resources and in prospering rather than just surviving.By comparison, this alien species has already reached pre-warp space exploration technology, whilst the lesser technology has shown itself barely capable of doing anything other than growing food for itself.So for no reason other than it's written in the script, Archer AGREES with Phlox, and ABANDONS these aliens to eventual extinction, with nothing more than some medical knowledge to make their deaths painless. Though we DO get a meta-referencing of a future set of rules that would tell humans what they could and could not do, some sort of ""directive"" Archer says with absolutely no subtlty in the writing at all.Our heroes, ladies and gentlemen, the FLAGSHIP of Starfleet, the missionaries of humanity.It's no wonder the Vulcans thought we weren't ready for space exploration.",1

If you leave 5 minutes early for work it might save you from an accident... then again it might put you in an accident... most likely neither. One does their best and the future takes care of itself.

The story is centered in the pleasant Denobulian Dr. Phlox, who is totally integrated to the human style of life but still have doubts related to relationship between male and female. The advice of T'Pol is very funny and logical, since she does not understand the matters of heart and love.

4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Dear Doctor (TV Episode 2002)","Love it or hate it, it's bound to get a response","""Dear Doctor"" is the first great episode of Enterprise and it is a prime example of exactly what makes Star Trek so great. The creative team gives us a story that weaves a touching tale of Phlox adapting to life on board a ship full of humans with a morality story that leaves the viewer asking questions long after it is over. Here we have an episode that has inspired vast amounts of love and hate among Trekkers, but in the end it does what it is supposed to do. It leaves you contemplating the ethics of Archer and Phlox's decision and questioning our existence.The majority of this episode is a beautifully written character development tale concerning Phlox learning to integrate himself into the crew. His tale of an outsider trying to fit in is one in which most of us can understand and had this been the entirety of the episode it would easily have rated slightly above average. Then we throw in a very interesting and compelling society on a planet which has two humanoid species, one advanced and another primitive that leaves us wishing an episode of The Next Generation would have revisited this planet. Finally, we get to the meat and potatoes of ""Dear Doctor"", the morality story. Like all previous series, Enterprise gives us a prime directive story which could very well be the basis for the prime directive that has become so important in the later shows. It is truly refreshing to see a prime directive story that actually has our crew follow the prime directive instead of giving into our emotions and helping a species from eventual extinction. The decision is not easy for Phlox or Archer to make, but they make it and an entire society must face their natural course of evolution which could very well end in an extinction of an entire species. This one is a truly beautiful and telling story that leaves the viewer contemplating the implications. Agree or disagree it does exactly what it is supposed to and it is a prime example of what makes Star Trek so beloved.",8
5,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Dear Doctor (TV Episode 2002)",Dr. Phlox's Trolley Problem,"This episode generates a lot of heat within the Star Trek community. Even the word ""genocide"" gets tossed around flippantly. Many have argued that Dr. Phlox has misinterpreted evolution and his and Dr. Archer's decision not to give the Valakians the cure to their genetic mutation problem is a nefarious act of species genocide. Unfortunately, this seems to me to be more of a gray area than some people proclaim.I'm not going to focus on the science of evolution (I'm not a scientist and have limited knowledge on the subject). I'll focus on the philosophical elements of the episode.The Valakians are a dying breed and their downfall will allow the Menk to rise up and experience some type of revolutionary breakthrough (according to what we're told). This leaves Archer and Phlox with the old trolley problem. Do they pull the switch, saving the Valakians from their inevitable demise and endanger the amelioration that the Menk people are currently experiencing? Or do they let nature run it's course and allow the Menk to prosper and grow as the Valakians slip away into extinction?Many have argued that Phlox has indirectly killed these Valakians via his withholding of a cure; I don't see it this way. Phlox's decision not to interfere has no mal-intent behind it. He doesn't see this species as ""lesser beings"" and is not out for blood, this isn't genocide. This planet's ecosystem is at a crossroads and if Phlox plays God, he is artificially deciding the victor in an environment he has no business controlling. If he were to save the Valakians, this race would be propped-up with a crutch and would be a genetically inferior race that should have been wiped out by natural process (bit of speculation on my part, I know). It's not in the Enterprise's job description to go out and preserve species for future generations. The Enterprise is in space in an exploratory capacity. This moral dilemma hints at future legislation dictating what to do in situations similar to this; but for now, Archer & Phlox must process with their best judgment.I really enjoyed this episode and the quandary it sets forth. Dr. Phlox's sub-plot of dealing with his expatriate lifestyle and emotions of homesickness and isolation and his quest for companionship is a nice touch. This all hits home as he copes with both this and the Valakain dilemma. Phlox is my favorite member of the Enterprise crew so far and an episode dedicated to developing his character was a great idea.Controversial yes, but well worth a watch.",8
6,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Dear Doctor (TV Episode 2002)",beyond disappointing,"I realize that the intent of this episode was to provide some background for the development of the Prime directive, but it did so very poorly. The Enterprise is asked to help a race called the Valakians who are suffering from a disease that is killing them by the millions. In the process of investigating the disease and the Valakian people, Dr Phlox discovers that there is a second sentient race on the planet; the Menk. Both species are living in apparent harmony, although the Menk are ""less evolved"" and the Valakians are clearly dominant. The Human crew feels that the Menk are being exploited, but Dr Phlox is dismissive of their concerns, blaming them on human cultural bias.While working on a cure, Dr Phlox discovers that the disease is actually a genetic flaw, and predicts that the Valakians will be extinct within 2 centuries. When he reports to the Captain, Dr Phlox also reveals that the Menk are more advanced than believed, and states that if the Enterprise helps the Valakians, they will be ""playing god"" and interfering with the evolution of the Menk. This is the point at which it really goes downhill for me. As another reviewer points out, the evolution of the so called ""genetic defect"" in the Valakians has some serious scientific flaws...it just doesn't fly. Also, why would anyone believe that the continued existence of the Valakians would be detrimental to the Menk? Their co-existence hasn't prevented the Menk from developing thus far. In fact, at this point, constant exposure to a more developed culture would likely create an environment which would encourage continued evolution of the Menk. It would be one thing if both species were at a much lower level of development, such as the Neanderthal and Cro-magnon that Dr Phlox compares them to. At that stage, the races would have been fighting to survive, and would have been rivals for available resources; but they are well past that point. Or if the planet were dealing with overpopulation pressures...and that isn't likely an issue with the millions of dead, and the knowledge of the availability of space based options for expansion. So, when it was thought that the Valakians were dying from a disease with a bacterial or viral cause, Dr Phlox was all (basically) ""sure, let's find a cure. Oh, there's another sentient race? Fascinating! The Menk are being used as a servant class, have had their land taken from them, and generally the Valakian's treatment of them is somewhere between benevolent ownership and condescending guardianship/mentoring...but if you humans are bothered by it that you're just prejudiced. It works for them"". But then when it turns out that the illness is genetic, suddenly his attitude is ""Oh, those Valakians are interfering with the evolution of the Menk, so let's let all the hundreds of millions of Valakians - including all future generations - die, and the species become extinct."" Yeah, that's a good plan. I guess I'm just not a fan of Genocide, even the fictional variety.",1
7,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Dear Doctor (TV Episode 2002)","Great episode, come on!","This is a story about humans first getting a glimpse of why prime directive would be a good idea. Yeah, it sometimes means abandoning people to their own fate, but that sometimes that's the right thing to do.A species A has a disease and the doctor on the ship has the cure. But there is another species B on the planet that doesn't have the disease. Do you give the species A the cure and help them become the dominant species on the planet, or do you just go away and let them die (in witch case species B will become dominant)... Probably, maybe...It's like when the dinosaurs were the dominant species on earth before the meteor struck. Would it have been right if a warp capable species had interfered? Bumped the meteor off it's course? Dinosaurs could still exist but humans probably wouldn't. What's the right thing to do?! Who are better, dinosaurs or humans?I don't know! Maybe let nature take it's course, not interfere. Prime directive! Great episode! I love Star Trek!Prime directive is the ""with great power comes great responsibility"" of Star Trek.

This species is pre-warp but technologically/industrially advanced.There is a second species, probably of similar ancestry, who live primitively, where there are somewhat treated inferior by the dominant species. They seem to be immune to the disease that is killing the dominant species. Once they mentioned that the 2nd species' immunity (and certain dependence/inferiority to the dominant species) I kept anticipating that Dr. Phlox would suggest interspecies mating to potentially weed out this genetic defect. It would solve the problem of the 2nd species being treated like inferior, as well. Unfortunately that suggestion was never brought up and I guess the writer of the episode just wanted to bring up the ""We can't play god"" theme where you don't intervene technologically/medically with a less advanced species. Honestly you don't need to intervene medically to eliminate genetic defects - it's called diversification with mating. Telling the dominant species to integrate the other 'inferior' species into their own and interbreed wouldn't be the 'playing god' thing. It's just common sense for anyone who has any comprehension of (genetic) diversity.",4

Plus, there is a serious ethical dilemma, as allowing the species to die out might just be in line with what would later be known as the prime directive.This episode is interesting because it's told from the Doctor's perspective.

This, of course, is the directive that prevents explorers from interfering with the natural evolution of a species. For instance, giving arms to an oppressed group so that they can even a score. Relocating a group to more fertile soil so they can become superior farmers. In this case, there are two species living side by side, one more intellectually evolved than the other, but that species is dying from a genetic disposition. Phlox is asked to come up with a medical treatment but since the ""lesser"" group is becoming more able, he sees perpetuating the dominant ones as a philosophical dilemma. It' the butterfly effect where everything we do sends waves out to change the fabric of the world. Of course, one could argue that interference is also a part of the natural order of things. It's certainly an interesting topic for conversation. I didn't appreciate the little Archer speech about ""someday."" It is kind of tacky.

This formula only works, however, when the writers of the episode understand the topic they are attempting to address. This story idea was really good and, as the current rating reflects (currently at 8.0), it is still, if only superficially, a pretty well produced episode. But, for many viewers who are knowledgeable of evolution and/or ethics, the fact that the writers really messed up both the science and the ethical philosophy that underlies the actions taken by Phlox and Archer, it makes this story rather contrived and hollow, and the conclusion rather ludicrous (e.g. since Phlox doesn't have a sound understanding of evolution and both characters reach a rather naive and unethical decision in the finale...under the misguided claim that they are making a hard, but ethical, decision).

Another important bit is the Vulcan's shadow government they control on the planet of Coridan. The mining agreement the planet has with Vulcan seems like it maybe the key as the extracts are most likely very valuable if the Vulcans care enough about this planet.

7,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Fusion (TV Episode 2002)",exploring the meaning of emotion,"Although emotions are everywhere, in all of us, they are at the same time nowhere to be found, since everything you can put a finger on and call an emotion will be different for any other person experiencing the same state. And yet, the names of emotions seem to be self-explanatory and self-evident. Star Trek stories are never realistic, in the sense that they unroll in a world of big ideas, delivered theatrically and without the bounds of present reality. Star Trek can ask big questions and although the answers are not always thorough, I have found that of all the popular television, Star Trek is the only show where these ""big questions"" are centered upon so much at all.One of the ways Star Trek does this is by having an alien race to stand for a metaphor or a symbol of one single human trait, flaw or a characteristic. The Volcans embody the rational part of us. Very often, this is portrayed as a flaw, the Volcans being arrogant and silly with their over-reliance on logic. This episode is special in that it portrays the Volcans' reliance on the suppression of all emotion and on logic as a vulnerability or disability. It also shows an interesting aspect of emotional exchanges in real human societies, that is, that emotions can be used in barter. If a person is drawn to a particular state, but depends on others to allow her to experience it, that person is susceptible to being used by people who see that they can use her need for a particular emotion to control her. This way, the emotion (be it fear, anger, lust, or security) becomes a sort of substance, like a drug, and the person who is drawn to it and must take it from others can be seen as an addict. This episode portrays this dynamic very well, along with the shame that a person who normally relies on her reason and composure to guide her in life feels when they own up to their addiction and / or find themselves incapable of resisting the need for a fix any more.Unfortunately, this episode is not perfect, in my opinion, and this is mostly due to how Enrique Murciano plays his Volcan character Tolaris. I simply can't see how his portrayal can be read as a coherent character. My reaction to the character can be caused by an emotional response, however - I find the character disturbing. However, in general, almost every line he speaks has the same intonation pattern. He also somehow has a smile on his face most of the time. Something in this character just didn't totally ""click"" for me, especially that he was one of the leads. These emotional Volcans had great potential, and I feel that the episode did not explore the potential of those characters deep enough. Anyhow, this episode is certainly worth watching, one of the top episodes of the series, in my opinion. All the regulars do a great job, as usual, with Scott Bacula once again proving he is perfect as this kind of captain. Of course, Jolene Blalock's T'Pol is impeccable, as always.

I am fairly certain some people used the same argument to defend slavery and fight abolition.The conclusion of this episode was spot-on.

Lots of other reviews complain about these, as well as other problems, so I won't waste anymore time doing this.This social commentary revolves around tradition versus moral principles. At what point do we cast aside traditions that have been passed down through generations in favor of modern morality? Is fishing for sport ethical? Is hunting game ethical? Is modern Japense whaling ethical? ST:E turns it full throttle by showing the Eska hunting sentient-beings (the Wraiths). In today's world, there are far more nuances and complications than is shown in this ST:E episode which makes this more difficult to answer.My problem with this episode is that the writers have made this issue so cut and dry by pitting two sentient lifeforms against each other, that it more closely resembles genocide and murder than it does recreational hunting. It seems that this is a point that the writers are trying to make (that modern hunting is akin to murdering another lifeform). By creating this genocide-like setting however, the writers don't leave the viewer any room for interpretation or polarity between right and wrong. It becomes far too preachy: ""This is right, this is wrong."" A great sci-fi allegory involves a story where the viewer can see both sides of the coin and make judgments for him or herself. Unfortunately this episode doesn't allow us to do that.Episode Note: Why do the most important and senior officers of the crew insist on exploring unknown planets by themselves first? (I know Enterprise isn't the only ST show guilty of this but can we fix it please? Shouldn't you send down some lackeys first to make sure it will be alright?

In my mind, it was a nod to Odo and the Shapeshifters from DS9, which was my Favourite part of that series.And the fact that they kept the nature of these Rogue Inhabitants a mystery until the end of the episode. It was also a statement about people who will hunt endangered animals, with no thought to species survival.

Some good social commentary too. Yes there are plot holes; the premise for the 'rogue planet' isn't viable in the slightest but to me that doesn't really matter, it reminded me of the good old fashioned times when Kirk had to defeat a giant green space hand by insulting it. I also continue to be impressed with ENT's visuals and cgi; for something that was made in 2001 it's remarkable how well they did, the creature design on the show is really great. Also some great lines from T'pol as always. I wouldn't say it's necessarily a bad episode, it had some really fun moments that gave me a good laugh and a good message even with the badly researched premise. Still, it's silly in the way that gives you that feeling of classic Trek and i found it very enjoyable.",10

It seems they used some sort of knockout gas and put everyone into deep sleep, though Trip was spared because he was in a decontamination chamber. After a while, the Ferengi awaken Archer, as they assume the humans are greedy jerks just like they are. Their question for Archer is 'where do you keep your vault?'--because they naturally assume these new creatures have a hiding place for their valuables. Archer uses this to his advantage and begins sowing discord among these interlopers by using their greed against them. Like previous Trek series, this one is meant as a humorous one and ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" so far has had precious little humor (aside from the episode where Trip got pregnant).

It would appear that the ship was indeed haunted.I rather enjoyed this stand-alone episode, Annie Wersching was good in the role of Liana and Rene Auberjonois, better known as Deep Space Nine's Constable Odo, makes a welcome guest appearance as her father.

It seems like every race of people the Enterprise run across is hiding something and the majority of the episode is used unearthing this mystery. Often times, if the group was up front from the beginning, much of the conflict could be avoided; this episode is no exception in that regard.Trip is turning into quite the womanizer and the chemistry between Trip and T'Pol is being foreshadowed at periodically. The last few episodes have really focused on Trip, T'Pol, and Captain Archer, really showing us who the premiere characters are in this show.This episode really highlights the difference between real and artificial. Ezral has created a fake, sheltered life for his daughter, not giving her the opportunity to experience and explore at her leisure.

Apparently, his people have had some encounters with the Sulabon and have decided the wisest course would be to imprison the entire race, even the ones who have done nothing. What they haven't counted on is that Archer and the gang don't take well to bigotry in any form (they have also had experiences with bad Sulabon members, but still have an open mind). Of course, the bad guys don't just detain these guys; they also abuse them, even the children. This is one of the better episodes.",8

I think captain Archer has severe god syndrome, acts as a dictator of micro-nation called the Enterprise, but he really should act more like a representative of Earth, which has just began to explore space, and avoid initiating potential conflict with another planet by literary assaulting it's prison facility. The writers try to make the viewers approve the captain's decisions by showing us the bruised crewman, but they were planning an escape after all, which means breaking their laws again. Also Archer's motivation to withdraw information about their encounters with the Sulivans is weak and hi is provoking a nation at war. I mean this episode is unrealistic not only from the usual points of view (tech and every alien in the universe looks human -- that is OK, cause it's sci-fi), but also diplomacy and the authority of a captain (I think the starfleet command would need to approve storming an alien prison)",2

However, over time two problems develop--the Captain spends a lot of time with other Suliban in custody and soon realizes that they are harmless and have nothing to do with the evil Suliban AND the interrogator is a total #&$%! He is not the nice guy he seem like when the show began and is more than willing to use torture to get information. Negotating with these people just doesn't seem possible and the Captain is not about to leave all these innocent folks in custody as well.The only problem I saw about the show is that it was an obvious parallel to interred Japanese during WWII. This was fine...but then having Archer talk about this seemed preachy and unnecessary. I think many in the audience got the parallel and didn't need the history lesson.

Archer and the gain try to help them escape.The analogy between internment camps used on Japanese-Americans during WWII is quite clear. The history lesson by Archer is unnecessary as the show disrespects its audience a little bit here by assuming we're unaware of the allegorical references. Besides this though, this is a good episode. We get to see the thought process of the Tandarans, claiming that they did this for the Sulibans' own protection, that they didn't want them falling into Cabal hands, etc. The ending climax scene felt a bit truncated but sometimes it can be hard for an episode to be condensed down to 50 minutes.Sadly this moralistic story is all too relevant in today's society.

I liked the ethical dilemmas explored with the treatment of the organism after first contact. Phlox refuses to allow tortuous experimentation on the sample he's collected, citing that this organism is an intelligent lifeform and this would be inhumane. Sidenote: If this species wasn't intelligent, would torturing it then be okay? I'm glad we get to see a few species on ST:E that are a bit more amorphic than we are used to seeing. Even though this species doesn't resemble us, we can still feel sympathy for it as it is separated from the remainder of the organism.Two parts I didn't like: One, I didn't enjoy the strange feud between T'Pol and Hoshi. Hoshi's got some thin skin and thinks T'Pol is unfairly targeting her and criticizing her. I don't know. I just found it odd and unnecessary to the plot. And since it was resolved with a ""I hold you to a higher standard since you're so smart"" line, it's not really a subplot moving forward. It didn't do anything for character development either. Unnecessary.Two, the subplot involving the Kreetassan being offended by the humans eating food in public. Okay, sure. There's a species out there that doesn't eat food in front of each other and finds it offensive to do that. I can buy that. What I can't buy is that the Kreetassan haven't run into other species out there eating in front of them. This would happen constantly to a warp-cable species. The Kreetassan would either have to adapt and get used to looking at this or they would have to tell other species of their custom and ask them politely not to do so. What they can't do is just angrily leave every time time they see someone eating or they'd be ostracized by all other species. Just didn't seem right unless this is one of the first contacts that the Kreetassan have had.

In that situation, of course they would take a peek inside to confirm the killing. Also, it was a little too cutesy when the door opens and V'Lar is standing there waiting for them.

What made me tear up is as the very end when the Ambassador is returning to her ship and she looks at Captain Archer and T'pol and notes that she senses trust between the two but something even stronger. She states that she senses the bonds of friendship. She notes, almost to herself, that this bodes well in the future for both of their people.That moved me because it often just takes one. One example of what it looks like to take a leap of faith, one example of standing out on your own or one role model who makes it look easy to take on risk and be successful. It takes only one example of what it looks like to friendly with someone we consider different to let us know that that's ok.I think it's important, as humanity, that we learn to love, not tolerate each other, especially those of us who have hurt others and dealt with each other as enemies. No one ethnicity or culture or nation is above another. We are all capable of great kindness, great sorrow, great love, and great triumph.

They accept the invitation and while having a good time with Kobral and his men, T'Pol receives a message from Torothan chancellor Trelitt. telling that Zobral is a wanted terrorist.""Desert Crossing"", the fame of Captain Archer with his assistance to the Sulibans in ""Detained"" supersedes himself. Kobral is an ambiguous character, and it is difficult to evaluate how honest he is. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Travessia do Deserto"" (""Desert Crossing"")",6
2,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Desert Crossing (TV Episode 2002)",No Good Deed Goes Unpunished,"Archer and the crew help to repair the ship of a gruff desert dwelling alien who insists on rewarding them with a trip to his desert planet. While there they become involved in a war between the main civilization and the rebels, represented by this fellow. Archer and Trip end up roaming the desert, trying to escape death while the crew of the Enterprise do what they can to find them. It's a sort of typical desert survival story with few surprises. T'Pol takes command and does a great job of keeping the aliens off their backs and combing the mass of sand that is the planet.",7
3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Desert Crossing (TV Episode 2002)",Space Lacrosse Amid a Civil War,"Captain Archer and the gang get another lesson in extraterrestrial diplomacy as they accidentally hitch themselves to a group of revolutionaries/terrorists (depending on your point of view). Can they detach themselves from this situation before it's too late?Early on in the first season, Archer & Co. were constantly getting themselves into sticky situations by being too trusting or not cautious enough with alien lifeforms. More recently this seems to have gone away as the crew has become wiser to the dangers around them; all until this episode of course.The Enterprise's Good Samaritan deed leads 2 of its officers to be caught in the crossfire. When will Archer and the crew learn to be a bit more cautious? I have a feeling it may soon come back to bite them if they're not careful.This was an okay filler episode that didn't really do much to further the larger plot at play here. Although, we did find out that word of the Enterprise's exploits is traveling around the galaxy. This may foreshadow unwanted attention down the line. Time will tell.Episode Note: It's always nice to see Clancy Brown. There can only be one!",7

T'Pol stays in the ship, while Captain Archer rents an apartment at the sea shore and intends to read; Travis intends to climb a very difficult mountain that moves; Commander Tucker and Lieutenant Reed seek out females in a club; and Hoshi intends only to practice her skills in languages without the use of a computer translator. Meanwhile Dr. Phlox intends to hibernate for two days in Enterprise. However, their plans fail and Travis has an accident and breaks his leg; Dr. Phlox is awakened to give medical assistance to Travis; Trip and Reed are trapped and robbed by thieves; and Archer meets an attractive woman that actually is a Tandaran interested in his knowledge of Sulibans. Only Hoshi has good-time with a handsome and gentle alien.""Two Days and Two Nights"" shows the troubled two days of leave of some members of Enterprise. The story should be a comedy, but it does not work well and becomes very silly and predictable. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Dois Dias e Duas Noites"" (""Two Days and Two Nights"")",6
1,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Two Days and Two Nights (TV Episode 2002)",Four Separate ratings,"This is a light-hearted episode of the crew vacationing on Reisa. There are four separate vacation story lines running here: Hoshi, Archer, Trip & Malcomn and Meriwhether's vacation abbreviated after and accident and then involving Dr. Phlox and T'pol. The success or failure of this show has to be judged by the individual story lines. So here's my opinion: Hoshi: successful good for 4, Phlox, T'Pol, Meriweather: successful good for 3, Trip & Malcolm: failed, Archer: failed to add to a 7 out of 10 The stories that succeeded did so because they added something new to the personality of the characters. Hoshi having a one-night-stand was rather surprising, but believable since they wrote the object of her romantic interest with some charm. Meriwhether's story line succeeded because I found Phlox's confusion coming out of ""hibernation"" and both T'Pol's stoic and Meriwhethers panicked reaction hilarious. However, Trip & Malcomn's problems was predictable and somewhat unbelievable. And Archer's problems were unmemorable and unsatisfying.",7
2,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Two Days and Two Nights (TV Episode 2002)",Heaping pile of clichés...,"If it is possible to think of a tired, threadbare, over-used comedic gimmick from any romantic comedy, these writers did. I understand _Enterprise_ was approaching the end of a long first season, so perhaps the writing staff were the ones sorely in need of a vacation. Still, this shameful waste of time dishonors the proud name of Star Trek. The Next Generation episode ""Captain's Holiday"" gives a much funnier and more endearing portrait of the galaxy's favorite shore-leave stop, Risa. Watch that instead, even if you've seen it before. I would have given this episode a ""1"", except that -- as a Star Trek fanatic -- I feel compelled to provide every episode a respectable rating. Besides, this installment is superior to the absolute worst of Star Trek (the Original Series' ""Spock's Brain"", the Next Generation's ""Shades of Grey"" etc.), so I have shown it mercy. ""Two Days and Two Nights"" doesn't pioneer new ways of being awful -- it simply recycles every bad joke you've ever heard.",5
3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Two Days and Two Nights (TV Episode 2002)",Like an order of really crappy meatballs....,"I love meatballs. But I find that I am often apprehensive ordering them when I eat out because too often the places selling them are cheapskates and fill them with bread and other fillers. A bit of bread is just fine but too much and you have a tasteless, bland product. Well, to me, ""Two Days and Two Nights"" is just like an order of bad meatballs--all filler and no real substance.The show is set during shore leave on Risa. Oddly, apparently 1/2 the crew are picked by lottery to go to Risa--and the ones who were 'randomly picked' were all the human main characters on the show. There, they all have a series of relatively boring adventures which do nothing to further the show's overarching plot. Trip and Reed go out in search of sex, Hoshi meets a nice guy and the Captain is really dumb in how he confronts a lady who is a spy. All in all, I cannot see much to the show. It's not really bad but it is a bit of a waste of time and talent.",3
4,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Two Days and Two Nights (TV Episode 2002)",Like a Bad Summer Vacaction Movie,"Captain Archer and the gang finally get to their shore leave destination they've been heading towards the last few episodes, but their vacations are not as relaxing as they were meant to be.This episode was a rough one to sit through. It was extremely boring and did nothing to really extend the overall plot or character arcs of any of the crew. We find out that this Tandaran lady might have a plan regarding the Suliban but, besides this fact, nothing remotely important happens in this episode. This close to the season finale, it seems like a waste of screen time to have a filler episode like this this late in the season.Archer's interactions with Keyla are boring. I'm getting real tired of the Tuck & Reed buddy cop movies we keep having to sit through, their zappy one liners typically miss the mark, these actors are not meant for this type of character. In the past I always thought Hoshi was a little too whiny but in this episode her mini-story is the only one worth watching at all. We really get to see the gentler side of Hoshi.This episode is one of the worst ones of Season 1. If you're going through the entire season, you can easily skip this one and not miss anything important.",3
5,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Two Days and Two Nights (TV Episode 2002)",Not Much Fun,"Since the original, ""Star Trek"" shows have always presented problems when the crew goes on shore leave. This is no exception, except the adventures are so dull. Hoshi goes to ply her translation trade and runs into a guy from a planet she can't pronounce. Tripp and Malcolm meet two babes who aren't what they seem. Mayweather goes rock climbing. And the Captain meets a sultry blonde. What happens with these encounters could have been interesting, but they just didn't have any kick. The only humorous thing that happened was Dr. Phlox being awakened from his hibernation to treat a patient. I would imagine that one of the characters may appear at a future time.",5

However, something goes wrong and the shuttle apparently ignites a huge explosion, destroying the colony and killing the entire group of colonists. After the investigation, the crew of the Enterprise finds out that plasma leaking of the shuttle had ignited tetrazine, causing the destruction of the colony. Captain Archer contacts Admiral Forrest and he calls off the mission of the Enterprise. While returning to the Starfleet base with Archer absolutely depressed, the Captain awakes in San Francisco ten months ago, and meets Daniels in his room. The time traveler tells him that the Temporal Accord and the time line that he was supposed to protect had had problems. Further, he guides Archer how to develop technology ahead of time and find evidences of his innocence in a cloak Sulliban cruiser hidden in Paraagan. The skeptical T'Pol does not believe on Archer when he tells that he traveled to the past and Daniels is alive. When Archer meets Silik, he has to take a tough decision.""Enterprise - Shockwave: Part 1"" is definitely the best episode of the First Season of Enterprise. The complex story has a very well developed screenplay, with the most dramatic and surprising situations. Unfortunately, as a common practice of distributors of TV shows, the episode is to be continued and end in the climax of the story. That is the reason why I prefer to watch most of these shows on DVD years later, to avoid the deception of, for example, ""Lost"". My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Onda de Choque  Parte Um"" (""Shockwave: Part One"")",10
1,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Shockwave (TV Episode 2002)",A Devastating Blow,"The Enterprise is on its way to a planet ruled by women. They are a quickly advancing culture. As the shuttle enters the atmosphere, there is a massive explosion, killing everyone. Archer is devastated, believing the shuttle caused the extermination on the planet. He is called back by Starfleet and the Vulcans, to face the music, possibly ending the mission of Enterprise. All tests show that it should not have happened. That night, Archer is transported back to earth, eight months earlier, where he meets the time traveler. He gives Archer information on what to do and absolves him and his crew of blame. Once again, our old friends the Suliban are in the middle of all this. They carry out a daring raid, but as the episode ends, everything goes wrong.",10

Is this the end of Star Fleet? Was it Archer fault?After the previous episode, we really needed a solid episode to close out the season and ST:E delivered! This went from an above-average episode to one of the best episodes of the season due to the last 10 minutes. Enterprise leaves us on a cliffhanger as we wait to see Archer's fate and the outcome of the Temporal Cold War. This ending actually has me intrigued for what we'll see in Season 2.",9
3,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" Shockwave (TV Episode 2002)",Those jerk-face Suliban!,"This episode begins with a shuttle from Enterprise appearing to cause a chain reaction which kills 3600 colonists. The Vulcans are more than ready to say 'I told you so' and push for the Earth's space program to be halted. However, in reviewing the accident, the crew realize that it was NOT caused by them but a cloaked Suliban ship! Those nasty time-traveling jerk-faces are back. What follows is an adventure that brings Agent Daniels (who was assumed killed by Silik) to help Archer to expose the Suliban base and defeat them. But, by the end of the show, the tide has turned against the humans and Archer is about to be captured--and is spirited off the ship by Daniels...to a future that is bleak on a dead Earth!This is a pretty exciting episode but also only part one of a two parter. It's very enjoyable but also one that is difficult to assess on its own. Very well done, however...and perhaps a bit better than part two.",9
